mansion a hereditari estat i would say a haunt hous and reach the height of romant felicitybut that would be ask too much of fate still i will proud declar that there is someth queer about it els whi should it be let so cheapli and whi have stood so long unten john laugh at me of cours but one expect that in marriag john is practic in the extrem he has no patienc with faith an intens horror of superstit and he scoff open at ani talk of thing not to be felt and seen and put down in figur john is a physician and perhapsi would not say it to a live soul of cours but this is dead paper and a great relief to my mindperhap that is one reason i do not get well faster you see he doe not believ i am sick and what can one do if a physician of high stand and one own husband assur friend and relat that there is realli noth the matter with one but temporari nervous depressiona slight hyster tendencywhat is one to do my brother is also a physician and also of high stand and he say the same thing so i take phosphat or phosphiteswhichev it is and tonic and journey and air and exercis and am absolut forbidden to work until i am well again person i disagre with their idea person i believ that congeni work with excit and chang would do me good but what is one to do i did write for a while in spite of them but it doe exhaust me a good dealhav to be so sli about it or els meet with heavi opposit i sometim fanci that in my condit if i had less opposit and more societi and stimulusbut john say the veri worst thing i can do is to think about my condit and i confess it alway make me feel bad so i will let it alon and talk about the hous the most beauti place it is quit alon stand well back from the road quit three mile from the villag it make me think of english place that you read about for there are hedg and wall and gate that lock and lot of separ littl hous for the garden and peopl there is a delici garden i never saw such a gardenlarg and shadi full of box border path and line with long grape cover arbor with seat under them there were greenhous too but they are all broken now there was some legal troubl i believ someth about the heir and coheir anyhow the place has been empti for year that spoil my ghostli i am afraid but i dont carether is someth strang about the housei can feel it i even said so to john one moonlight even but he said what i felt was a draught and shut the window i get unreason angri with john sometim im sure i never use to be so sensit i think it is due to this nervous condit but john say if i feel so i shall neglect proper self control so i take pain to control myselfbefor him at least and that make me veri tire i dont like our room a bit i want one downstair that open on the piazza and had rose all over the window and such pretti old fashion chintz hang but john would not hear of it he said there was onli one window and not room for two bed and no near room for him if he took anoth he is veri care and love and hard let me stir without special direct i have a schedul prescript for each hour in the day he take all care from me and so i feel base ungrat not to valu it more he said we came here sole on my account that i was to have perfect rest and all the air i could get your exercis depend on your strength my dear said he and your food somewhat on your appetit but air you can absorb all the time so we took the nurseri at the top of the hous it is a big airi room the whole floor near with window that look all way and air and sunshin galor it was nurseri first and then playroom and gymnasium i should judg for the window are bar for littl children and there are ring and thing in the wall the paint and paper look as if a boy school had use it it is strip offth paperin great patch all around the head of my bed about as far as i can reach and in a great place on the other side of the room low down i never saw a wors paper in my life one of those sprawl flamboy pattern commit everi artist sin it is dull enough to confus the eye in follow pronounc enough to constant irrit and provok studi and when you follow the lame uncertain curv for a littl distanc they sudden commit suicideplung off at outrag angl destroy themselv in unheard of contradict the color is repel almost revolt a smoulder unclean yellow strang fade by the slow turn sunlight it is a dull yet lurid orang in some place a sick sulphur tint in other no wonder the children hate it i should hate it myself if i had to live in this room long there come john and i must put this awayh hate to have me write a word we have been here two week and i havent felt like write befor sinc that first day i am sit by the window now up in this atroci nurseri and there is noth to hinder my write as much as i pleas save lack of strength john is away all day and even some night when his case are serious i am glad my case is not serious but these nervous troubl are dread depress john doe not know how much i realli suffer he know there is no reason to suffer and that satisfi him of cours it is onli nervous it doe weigh on me so not to do my duti in ani way i meant to be such a help to john such a real rest and comfort and here i am a compar burden alreadi nobodi would believ what an effort it is to do what littl i am ableto dress and entertain and order thing it is fortun mari is so good with the babi such a dear babi and yet i cannot be with him it make me so nervous i suppos john never was nervous in his life he laugh at me so about this wall paper at first he meant to repap the room but afterward he said that i was let it get the better of me and that noth was wors for a nervous patient than to give way to such fanci he said that after the wall paper was chang it would be the heavi bedstead and then the bar window and then that gate at the head of the stair and so on you know the place is do you good he said and realli dear i dont care to renov the hous just for a three month rental then do let us go downstair i said there are such pretti room there then he took me in his arm and call me a bless littl goos and said he would go down to the cellar if i wish and have it whitewash into the bargain but he is right enough about the bed and window and thing it is an airi and comfort room as ani one need wish and of cours i would not be so silli as to make him uncomfort just for a whim im realli get quit fond of the big room all but that horrid paper out of one window i can see the garden those mysteri deepshad arbor the riotous old fashion flower and bush and gnar tree out of anoth i get a love view of the bay and a littl privat wharf belong to the estat there is a beauti shade lane that run down there from the hous i alway fanci i see peopl walk in these numer path and arbor but john has caution me not to give way to fanci in the least he say that with my imagin power and habit of stori make a nervous weak like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excit fanci and that i ought to use my will and good sens to check the tendenc so i tri i think sometim that if i were onli well enough to write a littl it would reliev the press of idea and rest me but i find i get pretti tire when i tri it is so discourag not to have ani advic and companionship about my work when i get realli well john say we will ask cousin henri and julia down for a long visit but he say he would as soon put firework in my pillow case as to let me have those stimul peopl about now i wish i could get well faster but i must not think about that this paper look to me as if it knew what a vicious influenc it had there is a recurr spot where the pattern loll like a broken neck and two bulbous eye stare at you upsid down i get posit angri with the impertin of it and the everlasting up and down and sideway they crawl and those absurd unblink eye are everywher there is one place where two breadth didnt match and the eye go all up and down the line one a littl higher than the other i never saw so much express in an inanim thing befor and we all know how much express they have i use to lie awak as a child and get more entertain and terror out of blank wall and plain furnitur than most children could find in a toy store i rememb what a kind wink the knob of our big old bureau use to have and there was one chair that alway seem like a strong friend i use to feel that if ani of the other thing look too fierc i could alway hop into that chair and be safe the furnitur in this room is no wors than inharmoni howev for we had to bring it all from downstair i suppos when this was use as a playroom they had to take the nurseri thing out and no wonder i never saw such ravag as the children have made here the wall paper as i said befor is torn off in spot and it sticketh closer than a brotherthey must have had persever as well as hatr then the floor is scratch and goug and splinter the plaster itself is dug out here and there and this great heavi bed which is all we found in the room look as if it had been through the war but i dont mind it a biton the paper there come john sister such a dear girl as she is and so care of me i must not let her find me write she is a perfect and enthusiast housekeep and hope for no better profess i verili believ she think it is the write which made me sick but i can write when she is out and see her a long way off from these window there is one that command the road a love shade wind road and one that just look off over the countri a love countri too full of great elm and velvet meadow this wall paper has a kind of sub pattern in a differ shade a particular irrit one for you can onli see it in certain light and not clear then but in the place where it isnt fade and where the sun is just soi can see a strang provok formless sort of figur that seem to skulk about behind that silli and conspicu front design there sister on the stair well the fourth of juli is over the peopl are gone and i am tire out john thought it might do me good to see a littl compani so we just had mother and nelli and the children down for a week of cours i didnt do a thing jenni see to everyth now but it tire me all the same john say if i dont pick up faster he shall send me to weir mitchel in the fall but i dont want to go there at all i had a friend who was in his hand onc and she say he is just like john and my brother onli more so besid it is such an undertak to go so far i dont feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for anyth and im get dread fret and querul i cri at noth and cri most of the time of cours i dont when john is here or anybodi els but when i am alon and i am alon a good deal just now john is kept in town veri often by serious case and jenni is good and let me alon when i want her to so i walk a littl in the garden or down that love lane sit on the porch under the rose and lie down up here a good deal im get realli fond of the room in spite of the wall paper perhap becaus of the wall paper it dwell in my mind so i lie here on this great immov bedit is nail down i believeand follow that pattern about by the hour it is as good as gymnast i assur you i start well say at the bottom down in the corner over there where it has not been touch and i determin for the thousandth time that i will follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a conclus i know a littl of the principl of design and i know this thing was not arrang on ani law of radiat or altern or repetit or symmetri or anyth els that i ever heard of it is repeat of cours by the breadth but not otherwis look at in one way each breadth stand alon the bloat curv and flourishesa kind of debas romanesqu with delirium tremensgo waddl up and down in isol column of fatuiti but on the other hand they connect diagon and the sprawl outlin run off in great slant wave of optic horror like a lot of wallow seawe in full chase the whole thing goe horizont too at least it seem so and i exhaust myself in tri to distinguish the order of it go in that direct they have use a horizont breadth for a friez and that add wonder to the confus there is one end of the room where it is almost intact and there when the crosslight fade and the low sun shine direct upon it i can almost fanci radiat after allth intermin grotesqu seem to form around a common centr and rush off in headlong plung of equal distract it make me tire to follow it i will take a nap i guess i dont know whi i should write this i dont want to i dont feel abl and i know john would think it absurd but i must say what i feel and think in some wayit is such a relief but the effort is get to be greater than the relief half the time now i am aw lazi and lie down ever so much john say i musnt lose my strength and has me take cod liver oil and lot of tonic and thing to say noth of ale and wine and rare meat dear john he love me veri dear and hate to have me sick i tri to have a real earnest reason talk with him the other day and tell him how i wish he would let me go and make a visit to cousin henri and julia but he said i wasnt abl to go nor abl to stand it after i got there and i did not make out a veri good case for myself for i was cri befor i had finish it is get to be a great effort for me to think straight just this nervous weak i suppos and dear john gather me up in his arm and just carri me upstair and laid me on the bed and sat by me and read to me till it tire my head he said i was his darl and his comfort and all he had and that i must take care of myself for his sake and keep well he say no one but myself can help me out of it that i must use my will and self control and not let ani silli fanci run away with me there one comfort the babi is well and happi and doe not have to occupi this nurseri with the horrid wall paper if we had not use it that bless child would have what a fortun escap whi i wouldnt have a child of mine an impression littl thing live in such a room for world i never thought of it befor but it is lucki that john kept me here after all i can stand it so much easier than a babi you see of cours i never mention it to them ani morei am too wisebut i keep watch of it all the same there are thing in that paper that nobodi know but me or ever will behind that outsid pattern the dim shape get clearer everi day it is alway the same shape onli veri numer and it is like a woman stoop down and creep about behind that pattern i dont like it a bit i wonderi begin to thinki wish john would take me away from here it is so hard to talk with john about my case becaus he is so wise and becaus he love me so but i tri it last night it was moonlight the moon shine in all around just as the sun doe i hate to see it sometim it creep so slowli and alway come in by one window or anoth john was asleep and i hate to waken him so i kept still and watch the moonlight on that undul wall paper till i felt creepi the faint figur behind seem to shake the pattern just as if she want to get out i got up soft and went to feel and see if the paper did move and when i came back john was awak what is it littl girl he said dont go walk about like thatyoul get cold i though it was a good time to talk so i told him that i realli was not gain here and that i wish he would take me away whi darl said he our leas will be up in three week and i cant see how to leav befor the repair are not done at home and i cannot possibl leav town just now of cours if you were in ani danger i could and would but you realli are better dear whether you can see it or not i am a doctor dear and i know you are gain flesh and color your appetit is better i feel realli much easier about you i dont weigh a bit more said i nor as much and my appetit may be better in the even when you are here but it is wors in the morn when you are away bless her littl heart said he with a big hug she shall be as sick as she pleas but now let improv the shine hour by go to sleep and talk about it in the morn and you wont go away i ask gloomili whi how can i dear it is onli three week more and then we will take a nice littl trip of a few day while jenni is get the hous readi realli dear you are better better in bodi perhap i began and stop short for he sat up straight and look at me with such a stern reproach look that i could not say anoth word my darl said he i beg of you for my sake and for our child sake as well as for your own that you will never for one instant let that idea enter your mind there is noth so danger so fascin to a tempera like your it is a fals and foolish fanci can you not trust me as a physician when i tell you so so of cours i said no more on that score and we went to sleep befor long he thought i was asleep first but i wasnt and lay there for hour tri to decid whether that front pattern and the back pattern realli did move togeth or separ on a pattern like this by daylight there is a lack of sequenc a defianc of law that is a constant irrit to a normal mind the color is hideous enough and unreli enough and infuri enough but the pattern is tortur you think you have master it but just as you get well underway in follow it turn a back somersault and there you are it slap you in the face knock you down and trampl upon you it is like a bad dream the outsid pattern is a florid arabesqu remind one of a fungus if you can imagin a toadstool in joint an intermin string of toadstool bud and sprout in endless convolutionswhi that is someth like it that is sometim there is one mark peculiar about this paper a thing nobodi seem to notic but myself and that is that it chang as the light chang when the sun shoot in through the east windowi alway watch for that first long straight rayit chang so quick that i never can quit believ it that is whi i watch it alway by moonlightth moon shine in all night when there is a mooni wouldnt know it was the same paper at night in ani kind of light in twilight candl light lamplight and worst of all by moonlight it becom bar the outsid pattern i mean and the woman behind it is as plain as can be i didnt realiz for a long time what the thing was that show behind that dim sub pattern but now i am quit sure it is a woman by daylight she is subdu quiet i fanci it is the pattern that keep her so still it is so puzzl it keep me quiet by the hour i lie down ever so much now john say it is good for me and to sleep all i can inde he start the habit by make me lie down for an hour after each meal it is a veri bad habit i am convinc for you see i dont sleep and that cultiv deceit for i dont tell them im awakeo no the fact is i am get a littl afraid of john he seem veri queer sometim and even jenni has an inexplic look it strike me occasion just as a scientif hypothesisthat perhap it is the paper i have watch john when he did not know i was look and come into the room sudden on the most innoc excus and ive caught him sever time look at the paper and jenni too i caught jenni with her hand on it onc she didnt know i was in the room and when i ask her in a quiet a veri quiet voic with the most restrain manner possibl what she was do with the papersh turn around as if she had been caught steal and look quit angryask me whi i should frighten her so then she said that the paper stain everyth it touch that she had found yellow smooch on all my cloth and john and she wish we would be more care did not that sound innoc but i know she was studi that pattern and i am determin that nobodi shall find it out but myself life is veri much more excit now than it use to be you see i have someth more to expect to look forward to to watch i realli do eat better and am more quiet than i was john is so pleas to see me improv he laugh a littl the other day and said i seem to be flourish in spite of my wall paper i turn it off with a laugh i had no intent of tell him it was becaus of the wall paperh would make fun of me he might even want to take me away i dont want to leav now until i have found it out there is a week more and i think that will be enough im feel ever so much better i dont sleep much at night for it is so interest to watch develop but i sleep a good deal in the daytim in the daytim it is tiresom and perplex there are alway new shoot on the fungus and new shade of yellow all over it i cannot keep count of them though i have tri conscienti it is the strangest yellow that wall paper it make me think of all the yellow thing i ever sawnot beauti one like buttercup but old foul bad yellow thing but there is someth els about that paperth smell i notic it the moment we came into the room but with so much air and sun it was not bad now we have had a week of fog and rain and whether the window are open or not the smell is here it creep all over the hous i find it hover in the dine room skulk in the parlor hide in the hall lie in wait for me on the stair it get into my hair even when i go to ride if i turn my head sudden and surpris itther is that smell such a peculiar odor too i have spent hour in tri to analyz it to find what it smell like it is not badat first and veri gentl but quit the subtlest most endur odor i ever met in this damp weather it is aw i wake up in the night and find it hang over me it use to disturb me at first i thought serious of burn the houseto reach the smell but now i am use to it the onli thing i can think of that it is like is the color of the paper a yellow smell there is a veri funni mark on this wall low down near the mopboard a streak that run round the room it goe behind everi piec of furnitur except the bed a long straight even smooch as if it had been rub over and over i wonder how it was done and who did it and what they did it for round and round and roundround and round and roundit make me dizzi i realli have discov someth at last through watch so much at night when it chang so i have final found out the front pattern doe moveand no wonder the woman behind shake it sometim i think there are a great mani women behind and sometim onli one and she crawl around fast and her crawl shake it all over then in the veri bright spot she keep still and in the veri shadi spot she just take hold of the bar and shake them hard and she is all the time tri to climb through but nobodi could climb through that patternit strangl so i think that is whi it has so mani head they get through and then the pattern strangl them off and turn them upsid down and make their eye white if those head were cover or taken off it would not be half so bad i think that woman get out in the daytim and ill tell you whyprivately seen her i can see her out of everi one of my window it is the same woman i know for she is alway creep and most women do not creep by daylight i see her on that long road under the tree creep along and when a carriag come she hide under the blackberri vine i dont blame her a bit it must be veri humili to be caught creep by daylight i alway lock the door when i creep by daylight i cant do it at night for i know john would suspect someth at onc and john is so queer now that i dont want to irrit him i wish he would take anoth room besid i dont want anybodi to get that woman out at night but myself i often wonder if i could see her out of all the window at onc but turn as fast as i can i can onli see out of one at one time and though i alway see her she may be abl to creep faster than i can turn i have watch her sometim away off in the open countri creep as fast as a cloud shadow in a high wind if onli that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one i mean to tri it littl by littl i have found out anoth funni thing but i shant tell it this time it doe not do to trust peopl too much there are onli two more day to get this paper off and i believ john is begin to notic i dont like the look in his eye and i heard him ask jenni a lot of profession question about me she had a veri good report to give she said i slept a good deal in the daytim john know i dont sleep veri well at night for all im so quiet he ask me all sort of question too and pretend to be veri love and kind as if i couldnt see through him still i dont wonder he act so sleep under this paper for three month it onli interest me but i feel sure john and jenni are secret affect by it hurrah this is the last day but it is enough john is to stay in town over night and wont be out until this even jenni want to sleep with meth sli thing but i told her i should undoubt rest better for a night all alon that was clever for realli i wasnt alon a bit as soon as it was moonlight and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern i got up and ran to help her i pull and she shook i shook and she pull and befor morn we had peel off yard of that paper a strip about as high as my head and half around the room and then when the sun came and that aw pattern began to laugh at me i declar i would finish it to day we go away to morrow and they are move all my furnitur down again to leav thing as they were befor jenni look at the wall in amaz but i told her merrili that i did it out of pure spite at the vicious thing she laugh and said she wouldnt mind do it herself but i must not get tire how she betray herself that time but i am here and no person touch this paper but menot aliv she tri to get me out of the roomit was too patent but i said it was so quiet and empti and clean now that i believ i would lie down again and sleep all i could and not to wake me even for dinneri would call when i woke so now she is gone and the servant are gone and the thing are gone and there is noth left but that great bedstead nail down with the canva mattress we found on it we shall sleep downstair to night and take the boat home to morrow i quit enjoy the room now it is bare again how those children did tear about here this bedstead is fair gnaw but i must get to work i have lock the door and thrown the key down into the front path i dont want to go out and i dont want to have anybodi come in till john come i want to astonish him ive got a rope up here that even jenni did not find if that woman doe get out and tri to get away i can tie her but i forgot i could not reach far without anyth to stand on this bed will not move i tri to lift and push it until i was lame and then i got so angri i bit off a littl piec at one cornerbut it hurt my teeth then i peel off all the paper i could reach stand on the floor it stick horribl and the pattern just enjoy it all those strangl head and bulbous eye and waddl fungus growth just shriek with deris i am get angri enough to do someth desper to jump out of the window would be admir exercis but the bar are too strong even to tri besid i wouldnt do it of cours not i know well enough that a step like that is improp and might be misconstru i dont like to look out of the window eventher are so mani of those creep women and they creep so fast i wonder if they all come out of that wall paper as i did but i am secur fasten now by my well hidden ropeyou dont get me out in the road there i suppos i shall have to get back behind the pattern when it come night and that is hard it is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as i pleas i dont want to go outsid i wont even if jenni ask me to for outsid you have to creep on the ground and everyth is green instead of yellow but here i can creep smooth on the floor and my shoulder just fit in that long smooch around the wall so i cannot lose my way whi there john at the door it is no use young man you cant open it how he doe call and pound now hes cri for an axe it would be a shame to break down that beauti door john dear said i in the gentlest voic the key is down by the front step under a plantain leaf that silenc him for a few moment then he saidveri quiet inde open the door my darl i cant said i the key is down by the front door under a plantain leaf and then i said it again sever time veri gentl and slowli and said it so often that he had to go and see and he got it of cours and came in he stop short by the door what is the matter he cri for god sake what are you do i kept on creep just the same but i look at him over my shoulder ive got out at last said i in spite of you and jane and ive pull off most of the paper so
