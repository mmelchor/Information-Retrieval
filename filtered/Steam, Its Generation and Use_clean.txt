the height to which it could lift water was limit by the pressur the boiler and vessel could bear befor saveri engin was entir displac by it successor newcomen it was consider improv by desaguli who appli the papin safeti valv to the boiler and substitut condens by a jet within the vessel for saveri surfac condens in 1690 papin suggest that the condens of steam should be employ to make a vacuum beneath a cylind which had previous been rais by the expans of steam this was the earliest cylind and piston steam engin and his plan took practic shape in newcomen atmospher engin papin first engin was unwork owe to the fact that he use the same vessel for both boiler and cylind a small quantiti of water was place in the bottom of the vessel and heat was appli when steam form and rais the piston the heat was withdrawn and the piston did work on it down stroke under pressur of the atmospher after hear of saveri engin papin develop an improv form papin engin of 1705 consist of a displac chamber in which a float diaphragm or piston on top of the water kept the steam and water from direct contact the water deliv by the downward movement of the piston under pressur to a close tank flow in a continu stream against the vane of a water wheel when the steam in the displac chamber had expand it was exhaust to the atmospher through a valv instead of be condens the engin was in fact a non

modifi to serv mani purpos it use seem to have been limit almost entir to the pump of water the rivalri between saveri and papin appear to have stimul attent to the question of fuel save dr john allen in 1730 call attent to the fact that owe to the short length of time of the contact between the gase and the heat surfac of the boiler near half of the heat of the fire was lost with a view to overcom this loss at least partial he use an intern furnac with a smoke flue wind through the water in the form of a worm in a still in order that the length of passag of the gase might not act as a damper on the fire dr allen recommend the use of a pair of bellow for forc the sluggish vapor through the flue this is probabl the first suggest use of forc draft in form an estim of the quantiti of fuel lost

the improv in boiler and engin design of smeaton newcomen and their contemporari were follow by those of the great engin jame watt an instrument maker of glasgow in 1763 while repair a model of newcomen engin he was impress by the great wast of steam to which the altern cool and heat of the engin gave rise his remedi was the maintain of the cylind as hot as the enter steam and with this in view he ad a vessel separ from the cylind into which the steam should pass from the cylind and be there condens either by the applic of cold water outsid or by a jet from within to preserv a vacuum in his condens he ad an air pump which should serv to remov the water of condens and air brought in with the inject water or due to leakag as the cylind no longer act as a condens he could maintain it at a high temperatur by cover it with non conduct materi and in particular by the use of a steam jacket further and with the same object in view he cover the top of the cylind and introduc steam abov the piston to do the work previous accomplish by atmospher pressur after sever trial with an experiment apparatus base on these idea watt patent his improv in 1769 asid from their histor import watt improv as describ in his specif are to this day a statement of the principl which guid the scientif develop of the steam engin his word are my method of lessen the consumpt of steam and consequ fuel in fire engin consist of the follow principl first that vessel in which the power of steam are to be employ to work the engin which is call the cylind in common fire engin and which i call the steam vessel must dure the whole time the engin is at work be kept as hot as the steam that enter it first by enclos it in a case of wood or ani other materi that transmit heat slowli second by surround it with steam or other heat bodi and third by suffer neither water nor ani other substanc colder than the steam to enter or touch it dure that time second in engin that are to be work wholli or partial by condens of steam the steam is to be condens in vessel distinct from the steam vessel or cylind although occasion communic with them these vessel i call condens and whilst the engin are work these condens ought at least to be kept as cold as the air in the neighborhood of the engin by applic of water or other cold bodi third whatev air or other elast vapor is not condens by the cold of the condens and may imped the work of the engin is to be drawn out of the steam vessel or condens by mean of pump wrought by the engin themselv or otherwis fourth i intend in mani case to employ the expans forc of steam to press on the piston or whatev may be use instead of them in the same manner in which the pressur of the atmospher is now employ in common fire engin in case where cold water cannot be had in plenti the engin may be wrought by this forc of steam onli by discharg the steam into the air after it has done it offic sixth i intend in some case to appli a degre of cold not capabl of reduc the steam to water but of contract it consider so that the engin shall be work by the altern expans and contract of the steam last instead of use water to render the piston and other part of the engin air and steam tight i employ oil wax resin bodi fat of anim quick silver and other metal in their fluid state the fifth claim was for a rotari engin and need not be quot here the earli effort of watt are typic of those of the poor inventor struggl with insuffici resourc to gain recognit and it was not until he becam associ with the wealthi manufactur mattheu boulton of birmingham that he met with the success upon which his present fame is base in partnership with boulton the busi of the manufactur and the sale of his engin were high success in spite of vigor attack

are in action while the water is simpli be heat but they are not percept unless there are float particl in the liquid these current are caus by the joint action of the ad temperatur and two or more qualiti which the water possess 1st water in common with most other substanc expand when heat a statement howev strict true onli when refer to a temperatur abov 39 degre f or 4 degre c but as in the make of steam we rare have to do with temperatur so low as that we may for our present purpos ignor that except 2nd water is practic a non conductor of heat though not entir so if ice cold water was kept boil at the surfac the heat would not penetr suffici to begin melt ice at a depth of 3 inch in less than about two hour as therefor the heat water cannot impart it heat to it neighbor particl it remain expand and rise by it leviti while colder portion come to be heat in turn thus set up current in the fluid now when all the water has been heat to the boil point correspond to the pressur to which it is subject each ad unit of heat convert a portion about 7 grain in weight into vapor great increas it volum and the mingl steam and water rise more rapid still produc ebullit such as we have notic in the kettl so long as the quantiti of heat ad to the content of the kettl continu practic constant the condit remain similar to those we notic at first a tumultu lift of the water around the

somewhat smaller fig 2 with a hole in the bottom and support at a proper distanc from the side so as to separ the upward from the downward current we can forc the fire to a veri much greater extent without caus the kettl to boil over and when we place a deflect plate so as to guid the rise column toward the center it will be almost imposs to produc that effect this is the invent of perkin in 1831 and form the basi of veri mani of the arrang for produc free circul of the water in boiler which have been made sinc that time it consist in divid the current so that they will not interfer each

care for the three most import aim in steam boiler construct name effici durabl and safeti each of which is more or less depend upon a proper circul of the water as for effici we have seen one proof in our kettl when we provid mean to preserv the circul we found that we could carri a hotter fire and boil away the water much more rapid than befor it is the same in a steam boiler and we also notic that when there was noth but the unassist circul the rise steam carri away so much water in the form of foam that the kettl boil over but when the current were separ and an unimped circuit was establish this ceas and a much larger suppli of steam was deliv in a compar dri state thus circul increas the effici in two way it add to the abil to take up the heat and decreas the liabil to wast that heat by what is technic known as prime there is yet anoth way in which incident circul increas effici of surfac and that is by prevent in a greater or less degre the format of deposit thereon most water contain some impur which when the water is evapor remain to incrust the surfac of the vessel this incrust becom veri serious sometim so much so as to almost entir prevent the transmiss of heat from the metal to the water it is said that an incrust of onli one eighth inch will caus a loss of 25 per cent in effici and this is probabl within the truth in mani case circul of water will not prevent incrust altogeth but it lessen the amount in all water and almost entir so in some thus ad great to the effici of the surfac illustr fig 3 a second advantag to be obtain through circul is durabl of the boiler this it secur main by keep all part at a near uniform temperatur the way to secur the greatest freedom from unequ strain in a boiler is to provid for such a circul of the water as will insur the same temperatur in all part 3rd safeti follow in the wake of durabl becaus a boiler which is not subject to unequ strain of expans and contract is not onli less liabl to ordinari repair but also to ruptur and disastr explos by far the most prolif caus of explos is this same strain from unequ expans illustr fig 4 illustr 386 hors power instal of babcock and wilcox boiler at b f keith

set forth by a consider 1st of water tube boiler as a class as compar with shell and fire tube boiler and 2nd of the babcock and wilcox boiler specif as compar with other design of water tube boiler water tube versus fire tube boiler safetyth most import requir of a steam boiler is that it shall be safe in so far as danger from explos is concern if the energi in a larg shell boiler under pressur is consid the thought of the destruct possibl in the case of an explos is appal the late dr robert h thurston dean of sibley colleg cornel univers and past presid of the american societi of mechan engin estim that there is suffici energi store in a plain cylind boiler under 100 pound steam pressur to project it in case of an explos to a height of over 31/2 mile a locomot boiler at 125 pound pressur from one half to one third of a mile and a 60 hors power return tubular boiler under 75 pound pressur somewhat over a mile to quot a cubic foot of heat water under a pressur of from 60 to 70 pound per squar inch has about the same energi as one pound of gunpowd from such a consider it may be readili appreci how the advent of high pressur steam was one of the strongest factor in forc the adopt of water tube boiler a consider of the thick of materi necessari for cylind of various diamet under a steam pressur of 200 pound and assum an allow stress of 12000 pound per squar inch will perhap best illustr this point tabl 1 give such thick for various diamet of cylind not take into consider the weaken effect of ani joint which may be necessari the rapid with which the plate thick increas with the diamet is appar and in practic due to the fact that rivet joint must be use the thick as given in the tabl with the except of the first must be increas from 30 to 40 per cent in a water tube boiler the drum seldom exceed 48 inch in diamet and the thick of plate requir therefor is never excess the thinner metal can be roll to a more uniform qualiti the seam admit of better proport and the joint can be more easili and perfect fit than is the case where thicker plate are necessari all of these point contribut toward make the drum of water tube boiler better abl to withstand the stress which they will be call upon to endur the essenti construct differ between water tube and fire tube boiler lie in the fact that the former is compos of part of relat small diamet

fire tube or the intern fire furnac of certain type of boiler will collaps under a pressur much lower than that which they could withstand if it were appli intern this is due to the fact that if there exist ani initi distort from it true shape the extern pressur will tend to increas such distort and collaps the cylind while an intern pressur tend to restor the cylind to it origin shape stress due to unequ expans have been a fruit sourc of troubl in fire tube boiler in boiler of the shell type the rivet joint of the shell with their consequ doubl thick of metal expos to the fire give rise to

the case of a tube tube failur result from blister or burn are not serious in their natur where a tube ruptur becaus of a flaw in the metal the result may be more sever but there cannot be the disastr

when these same boiler are driven at high overload there will be a direct tendenc to prime and the percentag of moistur in the steam deliv will be high this tendenc is the result of the lack of proper

known as h {2}o exist in three state or conditionsic water and steam the onli differ between these state or condit is in the presenc or absenc of a quantiti of energi exhibit part in the form of heat and part in molecular activ which for want of a better name we are accustom to call latent heat and to transform it from one state to anoth we have onli to suppli or extract heat for instanc if we take a quantiti of ice say one pound at absolut zero11 and suppli heat the first effect is to rais it temperatur until it arriv at a point 492 fahrenheit degre abov the start point here it stop grow warmer though we keep on ad heat it howev chang from ice to water and when we have ad suffici heat to have made it had it remain ice 283 degre hotter or a temperatur of 315 degre fahrenheit thermomet it has all becom water at the same temperatur at which it commenc to chang name 492 degre abov absolut zero or 32 degre by fahrenheit scale let us still continu to add heat and it will now grow warmer again though at a slower ratethat is it now take about doubl the quantiti of heat to rais the pound one degre that it did beforeuntil it reach a temperatur of 212 degre fahrenheit or 672 degre absolut assum that we are at the level of the sea here we find anoth critic point howev much more heat we may appli the water as water at that pressur cannot be heat ani hotter but chang on the addit of heat to steam and it is not until we have ad heat enough to have rais the temperatur of the water 966 degre or to 1178 degre by fahrenheit thermomet presum for the moment that it specif heat has not chang sinc it becam water that it has all becom steam which steam nevertheless is at the temperatur of 212 degre at which the water began to chang thus over four fifth of the heat which has been ad to the water has disappear or becom insens in the steam to ani of our instrument it follow that if we could reduc steam at atmospher pressur to water without loss of heat the heat store within it would caus the water to be red hot and if we could further chang it to a solid like ice without loss of heat the solid would be white hot or hotter than melt steelit be assum of cours that the specif heat of the water and ice remain normal or the same as they respect are at the freez point after steam has been form a further addit of heat increas the temperatur again at a much faster ratio to the quantiti of heat ad which ratio also vari accord as we maintain a constant pressur or a constant volum and i am not awar that ani other critic point exist where this will ceas to be the fact until we arriv at that veri high temperatur known as the point of dissoci at which it becom resolv into it origin gase the heat which has been absorb by one pound of water to convert it into a pound of steam at atmospher pressur is suffici to have melt 3 pound of steel or 13 pound of gold this has been transform into someth besid heat store up to reappear as heat when the process is revers that condit is what we are pleas to call latent heat and in it resid main the abil of the steam to do work graph temperatur in fahrenheit degre from absolut zero against quantiti of heat in british thermal unit the diagram show graphic the relat of heat to temperatur the horizont scale be quantiti of heat in british thermal unit and the vertic temperatur in fahrenheit degre both reckon from absolut zero and by the usual scale the dot line for ice and water show the temperatur which would have been obtain if the condit had not chang the line mark gold and steel show the relat to heat and temperatur and the melt point of these metal all the inclin line would be slight curv if attent had been paid to the chang specif heat but the curvatur would be small it is worth note that with one or two except the curv of all substanc lie between the vertic and that for water that is to say that water has a greater capac for heat than all other substanc except two hydrogen and bromin in order to generat steam then onli two step are requir 1st procur the heat and 2nd transfer it to the water now you have it laid down as an axiom that when a bodi has been transfer or transform from one place or state into anoth the same work has been done and the same energi expend whatev may have been the intermedi step or condit or whatev the apparatus therefor when a given quantiti of water at a given temperatur has been made into steam at a given temperatur a certain definit work has been done and a certain amount of energi expend from whatev the heat may have been obtain or whatev boiler may have been employ for the purpos a pound of coal or ani other fuel has a definit heat produc capac and is capabl of evapor a definit quantiti of water under given condit that is the limit beyond which even perfect cannot go and yet i have known and doubtless you have heard of case where inventor have claim and so call engin have certifi to much higher result the first step in generat steam is in burn the fuel to the best advantag a pound of carbon will generat 14500 british thermal unit dure combust into carbon dioxid and this will be the same whatev the temperatur or the rapid at which the combust may take place if possibl we might oxid it at as slow a rate as that with which iron rust or wood rot in the open air or we might burn it with the rapid of gunpowd a ton in a second yet the total heat generat would be precis the same again we may keep the temperatur down to the lowest point at which combust can take place by bring larg bodi of air in contact with it or otherwis or we may suppli it with just the right quantiti of pure oxygen and burn it at a temperatur approach that of dissoci and still the heat unit given off will be neither more nor less it follow therefor that great latitud in the manner or rapid of combust may be taken without affect the quantiti of heat generat but in practic it is found that other consider limit this latitud and that there are certain condit necessari in order to get the most avail heat from a pound of coal there are three way and onli three in which the heat develop by the combust of coal in a steam boiler furnac may be expend 1st and princip it should be convey to the water in the boiler and be util in the product of steam to be perfect a boiler should so util all the heat of combust but there are no perfect boiler 2nd a portion of the heat of combust is convey up the chimney in the wast gase this is in proport to the weight of the gase and the differ between their temperatur and that of the air and coal befor they enter the fire 3rd anoth portion is dissip by radiat from the side of the furnac in a stove the heat is all use in these latter two way either it goe off through the chimney or is radiat into the surround space it is one of the princip problem of boiler engin to render the amount of heat thus lost as small as possibl the loss from radiat is in proport to the amount of surfac it natur it temperatur and the time it is expos this loss can be almost entir elimin by thick wall and a smooth white or polish surfac but it amount is ordinarili so small that these extraordinari precaut do not pay in practic it is evid that the temperatur of the escap gase cannot be brought below that of the absorb surfac while it may be much greater even to that of the fire this is suppos that all of the escap gase have pass through the fire in case air is allow to leak into the flue and mingl with the gase after they have left the heat surfac the temperatur may be brought down to almost ani point abov that of the atmospher but without ani reduct in the amount of heat wast it is in this way that those low chimney temperatur are sometim attain which pass for proof of economi with the unobserv all surplus air admit to the fire or to the gase befor they leav the heat surfac increas the loss we are now prepar to see whi and how the temperatur and the rapid of combust in the boiler furnac affect the economi and that though the amount of heat develop may be the same the heat avail for the generat of steam may be much less with one rate or temperatur of combust than anoth assum that there is no air pass up the chimney other than that which has pass through the fire the higher the temperatur of the fire and the lower that of the escap gase the better the economi for the loss by the chimney gase will bear the same proport to the heat generat by the combust as the temperatur of those gase bear to the temperatur of the fire that is to say if the temperatur of the fire is 2500 degre and that of the chimney gase 500 degre abov that of the atmospher the loss by the chimney will be 500/2500 = 20 per cent therefor as the escap gase cannot be brought below the temperatur of the absorb surfac which is practic a fix quantiti the temperatur of the fire must be high in order to secur good economi the loss by radiat be practic proport to the time occupi the more coal burn in a given furnac in a given time the less will be the proportion loss from that caus it therefor follow that we should burn our coal rapid and at a high temperatur to secur the best avail economi illustr portion of 9880 hors

insolubl carbon of lime or magnesia which precipit the neutral soda remain in solut if free carbon acid or bicarbon are present bicarbon of lime is form and remain in solut though under the action of heat the carbon dioxid will be driven off and insolubl monocarbon will be form caustic soda use in this process caus a more energet action it be presum that the caustic soda absorb the carbon acid becom carbon of soda and act as abov 3rd lime and soda process this process which is the combin of the first two is by far the most general use in water purif such a method is use where sulphat of

caustic will fall to approxim half the alkalin the hard should not be in excess of two point less than the alkalin where too great a quantiti of soda is use the hard is lower and the alkalin rais if too littl soda the hard is rais and the alkalin lower alkalin and caustic are test with a standard solut of sulphur acid a standard soap solut is use for test for hard and a silver nitrat solut may

and pump is claim to have a thermal effici of 100 per cent sinc all of the heat in the steam use is return to the boiler with the water this claim lead to an erron idea if a pump is use in feed the water to a boiler and the heat in the exhaust from the pump is impart to the feed water the pump has as high a thermal effici as the injector the pump has the further advantag that it use so much less steam for the forc of a given quantiti of water into the boiler that it make possibl a greater save through the use of the exhaust from other auxiliari for heat the feed which exhaust if an injector were use would be wast as has been point out in locomot practic injector are use becaus there is no exhaust steam avail for heat the feed this be util in produc a forc draft and becaus of space requir

if in the satur state that is the pressur is a function of the temperatur onli steam is water vapor and at a pressur of say 150 pound absolut per squar inch satur steam can exist onli at a temperatur 358 degre fahrenheit henc if the pressur of satur steam be fix it temperatur is also fix and vice versa satur steam is water vapor in the condit in which it is generat from water with which it is in

the pressur be increas or the temperatur decreas a portion of the steam will be condens if the temperatur be increas or the pressur decreas a portion of the water with which the steam is in contact will be evapor into steam steam will remain satur just so long as it is of the same pressur and temperatur as the water with which it can remain in contact without a gain or loss of heat moreov satur

case satur steam is accompani by water which is carri along with it either in the form of a spray or is blown along the surfac of the pipe and the steam is then said to be wet the percentag weight of the steam in a mixtur of steam and water is call the qualiti of the steam thus if in a mixtur of 100 pound of steam and water there is three quarter of a pound of water the qualiti of the steam will be 9925 heat may be ad to steam not in contact with water such an addit of heat result in an increas of temperatur and pressur if the volum be kept constant or an increas in temperatur and volum if the pressur remain constant steam whose temperatur thus exceed that of satur steam at a correspond pressur is said to be superh and it properti approxim those of a perfect gas as point out in the chapter on heat the heat necessari to rais one pound of water from 32 degre fahrenheit to the point of ebullit is call the heat of the liquid the heat absorb dure ebullit consist of that necessari to dissoci the molecul or the inner latent heat and that necessari to overcom the resist to the increas in volum or the outer latent heat these two make up the latent heat of evapor and the sum of this latent heat of evapor and the heat of the liquid make the total heat of the steam these valu for various pressur are given in the steam tabl page 122 to 127 the specif volum of satur steam at ani pressur is the volum in cubic feet of one pound of steam at that pressur the densiti of satur steam that is it weight per cubic foot is obvious the reciproc of the specif volum this densiti vari as the 16/17 power over the ordinari rang of pressur use in steam boiler work and may be found by the formula d = 003027p{941} which is correct within 015 per cent up to 250 pound pressur the relat volum of steam is the ratio of the volum of a given weight to the volum of the same weight of water at 392 degre fahrenheit and is equal to the specif volum time 62427 as vapor are liquid in their gaseous form and the boil point is the point of chang in this condit it is clear that this point is depend upon the pressur under which the liquid exist this fact is of great practic import in steam condens

feed temperatur and steam pressur in boiler test fuel perform and the like will be found to vari wide in differ trial in order to secur a mean for comparison of differ trial it is necessari to reduc all result to some common basi the method which has been adopt for the reduct to a compar basi is to transform the evapor under actual condit of steam pressur and feed temperatur which exist in the trial to an equival evapor under a set of standard condit these standard condit presuppos a feed water temperatur of 212 degre fahrenheit and a steam pressur equal to the normal atmospher pressur at sea level 147 pound absolut under such condit steam would be generat at a temperatur of 212 degre the temperatur correspond to atmospher pressur at sea level from water at 212 degre the weight of water which would be evapor under the assum standard condit by exact the amount of heat absorb by the boiler under actual condit exist in the trial is therefor call the equival evapor from and at 212 degre the factor for reduc the weight of water actual convert into steam from the temperatur of the feed at the steam pressur exist in the trial to the equival evapor under standard condit is call the factor of evapor this factor is the ratio of the total heat ad to one pound of steam under the standard condit to the heat ad to each pound of steam in heat the water from the temperatur of the feed in the trial to the temperatur correspond to the pressur exist in the trial this heat ad is obvious the differ between the total heat of evapor of the steam at the pressur exist in the trial and the heat of the liquid in the water at the temperatur at which it was fed in the trial to illustr by an exampl in a boiler trial the temperatur of the feed water is 60 degre fahrenheit and the pressur

one pound of water under standard condit would on the other hand have requir but 9704 b t u which as describ is the latent heat of evapor at 212 degre fahrenheit express differ the total heat of one pound of steam at the pressur correspond to a temperatur of 212 degre is 11504 b t u one pound of water at 212 degre contain 180 b t u of sensibl heat abov 32 degre fahrenheit henc under standard condit 11504 180 = 9704 b t u is ad in the chang of one pound of water into steam at atmospher pressur and a temperatur of 212 degre this is in effect the definit of the latent heat of evapor henc if condit of the trial had been standard onli 9704 b t u would be requir and the ratio of 116782 to 9704 b t u is the ratio determin the factor of evapor the factor in the assum case is 116782 ÷ 9704 = 12034 and if the same amount of heat had been absorb under standard condit as was absorb in the trial condit 12034 time the amount of steam would have been generat express as a formula for use with ani set of condit the factor is h h f = 2 9704 where h = the total heat of steam abov 32 degre fahrenheit from steam tabl h = sensibl heat of feed water abov 32 degre fahrenheit from tabl 22 in the

where superheat is present sinc onli a relat small amount of the heat in the steam is impart at the maximum or superh temperatur the advantag of the use of high pressur steam may be also indic by consid the question from the aspect of volum with an increas of pressur come a decreas in volum thus one pound of satur steam at 100 pound absolut pressur occupi 443 cubic feet while at 200 pound pressur it occupi 229 cubic feet if then in separ cylind of the same dimens one pound of steam at 100 pound absolut pressur and one pound at 200 pound absolut pressur enter and are allow to expand to the full volum of each cylind the high pressur steam have more room and a greater rang for expans than the low pressur steam will thus do more work this increas in the amount of work as was the increas in temperatur is larg relat to the addit fuel requir as indic by the total heat in general it may be state that the fuel requir to impart a given amount of heat to a boiler is practic independ of the steam pressur sinc the temperatur of the fire is so high as compar with the steam temperatur that a variat in the steam temperatur doe not produc an appreci effect the formula for the algebra

though sinc it may not measur the heat in the steam the name is not descript of the function of the apparatus the first form use was the barrel calorimet but the liabil of error was so great that it use was abandon modern calorimet are in general of either the throttl or separ type throttl calorimeterfig 14 show a typic form of throttl calorimet steam is drawn from a vertic main through the sampl

well which should be fill with mercuri or heavi cylind oil illustr fig 14 throttl calorimet and sampl nozzl the instrument and all pipe and fit lead to it should be thorough insul to diminish radiat loss care must be taken to prevent the orific from becom choke with dirt and to see that no leak occur the exhaust pipe should be short to prevent back pressur below the disk when steam pass through an orific from a higher to a lower pressur as is the case with the throttl calorimet no extern work has to be done in overcom a resist henc if there is no loss from radiat the quantiti of heat in the steam will be exact the same after pass the orific as befor pass if the higher steam pressur is 160 pound gaug and the lower pressur that of the atmospher the total heat in a pound of dri steam at the former pressur is 11959 b t u and at the latter pressur 11504 b t u a differ of 454 b t u as this heat will still exist in the steam at the lower pressur sinc there is no extern work done it effect must be to superheat the steam assum the specif heat of superh steam to be 047 each pound pass through will be superh 454/047 = 966 degre if howev the steam had contain one per cent of moistur it would have contain less heat unit per pound than if it were dri sinc the latent heat of steam at 160 pound gaug pressur is 8528 b t u it follow that the one per cent of moistur would have requir 85 b t u to evapor it leav onli 454 85 = 369 b t u avail for superh henc the superheat would be 369/047 = 785 degre as against 966 degre for dri steam in a similar manner the degre of superheat for other percentag of moistur may be determin the action of the throttl calorimet is base upon the forego fact as shown below let h = total heat of one pound of steam at boiler pressur l = latent heat of steam at boiler pressur h = total heat of steam at reduc pressur after pass orific t {1} = temperatur of satur steam at the reduc pressur t {2} = temperatur of steam after expand through the orific in the

as follow assum a gaug pressur of 180 pound and a thermomet read of 295 degre the intersect of the vertic line from the scale of temperatur as shown by the calorimet thermomet and the horizont line from the scale of gaug pressur will indic direct the per cent of moistur in the steam as read from the diagon scale in the present instanc this per cent is 10 sourc of error in the apparatusa slight error may aris from the valu 047 use as the specif heat of superh steam at atmospher pressur this valu howev is veri near correct and ani error result from it use will be neglig there is ordinarili a larger sourc of error due to the fact that the stem of the thermomet is not heat to it full length to an initi error in the thermomet and to radiat loss with an ordinari thermomet immers in the well to the 100 degre mark the error when regist 300 degre would be about 3 degre and the true temperatur be 303 degrees19 the steam is evid lose heat through radiat from the moment it enter the sampl nippl the heat avail for evapor moistur and superh steam after it has pass through the orific into the lower pressur will be diminish by just the amount lost through radiat and the valu of t {2} as shown by the calorimet thermomet will therefor be lower than if there were no such loss the method of correct for the thermomet and radiat error recommend by the power test committe of the american societi of mechan engin is by refer the read as found on the boiler trial to a normal read of the thermomet this normal read is the read of the lower calorimet thermomet for dri satur steam and should be determin by attach the instrument to a horizont steam pipe in such a way that the sampl nozzl project upward to near the top of the pipe there be no perfor in the nozzl and the steam taken onli through it open upper end the test should be made with the steam in a quiescent state and with the steam pressur maintain as near as possibl at the pressur observ in the main trial the calorimet thermomet to be the same as was use on the trial or one exact similar with a normal read thus obtain for a pressur approxim the same as exist in the trial the true percentag of moistur in the steam that is with the proper correct made for radiat may be calcul as follow let t denot the normal read for the condit exist in the trial the effect of radiat from the instrument as point out will be to lower the temperatur of the steam at the lower pressur let x {1} repres the proport of water in the steam which will lower it temperatur an amount equal to the loss by radiat then h h 047t t {1} x {1} = l this amount of moistur x {1} was not in the steam origin but is the result of condens in the instrument through radiat henc the true amount of moistur in the steam repres by x is the differ between the amount as determin in the trial and that result from condens or x = x x {1} h h 047t {2} t {1} h h 047t t {1} = l l 047t t {2} = 6 l as t and t {2} are taken with the same thermomet under the same set of condit ani error in the read of the thermomet will be approxim the same for the temperatur t and t {2} and the abov method therefor correct for both the radiat and thermomet error the theoret read for dri steam where there are no loss due to radiat are obtain from formula 5 by let x = 0 and solv for t {2} the differ between the theoret read and the normal read for no moistur will be the thermomet and radiat correct to be appli in order that the correct read of t {2} may be obtain for ani calorimet within the rang of it ordinari use such a thermomet and radiat correct taken from one normal read is approxim correct for ani condit with the same or a duplic thermomet the percentag of moistur in the steam correct for thermomet error and radiat and the correct to be appli to the particular calorimet use would be determin as follow assum a gaug pressur in the trial to be 180 pound and the thermomet read to be 295 degre a normal read taken in the manner describ give a valu of t = 303 degre then the percentag of moistur correct for thermomet error and radiat is 047303 295 x = 8450 = 045 per cent the theoret read for dri steam will be 11977 11504 047t {2} 212 0 = 8450 t {2} = 313 degre the thermomet and radiat correct to be appli to the instrument use therefor over the ordinari rang of pressur is correct = 313 303 = 10 degre the chart may be use in the determin of the correct read of moistur percentag and the perman radiat correct for the instrument use without comput as follow assum the same trial pressur feed temperatur and normal read as abov if the normal read is found to be 303 degre the correct for thermomet and radiat will be the theoret read for dri steam as found from the chart less this normal read or 10 degre correct the correct temperatur for the trial in question is therefor 305 degre the moistur correspond to this temperatur and 180 pound gaug pressur will be found from the chart to be 045 per cent illustr fig 16 compact throttl calorimet there are mani form of throttl calorimet all of which work upon the same principl the simplest one is probabl that shown in fig 14 an extrem conveni and compact design is shown in fig 16 this calorimet consist of two concentr metal cylind screw to a cap contain a thermomet well the steam pressur is measur by a gaug place in the suppli pipe or other conveni locat steam pass through the orific a and expand to atmospher pressur it temperatur at this pressur be measur by a thermomet place in the cup c to prevent as far as possibl radiat loss the annular space between the two cylind is use as a jacket steam be suppli to this space through the hole b the limit of moistur within which the throttl calorimet will work are at sea level from 288 per cent at 50 pound gaug pressur and 717 per cent moistur at 250 pound pressur separ calorimeterth separ calorimet mechan separ the entrain water from the steam and collect it in a reservoir where it amount is either indic by a gaug glass or is drain off and weigh fig 17 show a calorimet of this type the steam pass out of the calorimet through an orific of known size so that it total amount can be calcul or it can be weigh a gaug is ordinarili provid with this type of calorimet which show the pressur in it inner chamber and the flow of steam for a given period this latter scale be graduat by trial the instrument like a throttl calorimet should be well insul to prevent loss from radiat while theoret the separ calorimet is not limit in capac it is well in case where the percentag of moistur present in the steam is known to be high to attach a throttl calorimet to it exhaust this in effect is the use of the separ calorimet as a small separ between the sampl nozzl and the throttl instrument and is necessari to insur the determin of the full percentag of moistur in the steam the sum of the percentag shown by the two instrument is the moistur content of the steam the steam pass through a separ calorimet may be calcul by napier formula the size of the orific be known there are object to such a calcul howev in that it is difficult to accur determin the area of such small orific further small orific have a tendenc to becom part close by sediment that may be carri by the steam the more accur method of determin the amount of steam pass through the instrument is as follow illustr fig 17 separ calorimet a hose should be attach to the separ outlet lead to a vessel of water on a platform scale graduat to 1/100 of a pound the steam outlet should be connect to anoth vessel of water rest on a second scale in each case the weight of each vessel and it content should be note when readi for an observ the instrument should be blown out thorough so that there will be no water within the separ the separ drip should then be close and the steam hose insert into the vessel of water at the same instant when the separ has accumul a suffici quantiti of water the valv of the instrument should be close and the hose remov from the vessel of water the separ should be empti into the vessel on it scale the final weight of each vessel and it content are to be note and the differ between the final and origin weight will repres the weight of moistur collect by the separ and the weight of steam from which the moistur has been taken the proport of moistur can then be calcul from the follow formula 100 w x = 7 w w where x = per cent moistur in steam w = weight of steam condens w = weight of moistur as taken out by the separ calorimet sampl nippleth principl sourc of error in steam calorimet determin is the failur to obtain an averag sampl of the steam deliv by the boiler and it is extrem doubt whether such a sampl is ever obtain the two govern featur in the obtain of such a sampl are the type of sampl nozzl use and it locat the american societi of mechan engin recommend a sampl nozzl made of one half inch iron pipe close at the inner end and the interior portion perfor with not less than twenti one eighth inch hole equal distribut from end to end and prefer drill in irregular or spiral row with the first hole not less than one half inch from the wall of the pipe mani engin object to the use of a perfor sampl nippl becaus it ordinarili indic a higher percentag of moistur than is actual present in the steam this is due to the fact that if the perfor come close to the inner surfac of the pipe the moistur which in mani instanc cling to this surfac will flow into the calorimet and caus a larg error where a perfor nippl is use in general it may be said that the perfor should be at least one inch from the inner pipe surfac a sampl nippl open at the inner end and unperfor undoubt give as accur a measur as can be obtain of the moistur in the steam pass that end it would appear that a satisfactori method of obtain an averag sampl of the steam would result from the use of an open end unperfor nippl pass through a stuf box which would allow the end to be place at ani point across the diamet of the steam pipe incident to a test of a 15000 k w steam engin turbin unit mr h g stott and mr r g s pigott find no experiment data bear on the subject of low pressur steam qualiti determin made a investig of the subject and the sampl nozzl illustr in fig 18 was develop in speak of sampl nozzl in the determin of the moistur content of low pressur steam mr pigott say the ordinari standard perfor pipe sampler is absolut worthless in give a true sampl and it is vital that the sampl be abstract from the main without chang it direct or veloc until it is safe within the sampl pipe and entir

content of steam not onli in the case of low but also in high pressur steam locat of sampl nozzleth calorimet should be locat as near as possibl to the point from which the steam is taken and the sampl nippl should be place in a section of the main pipe near the boiler and where there is no chanc of moistur pocket in the pipe the american societi of mechan engin recommend that a sampl nippl of which a descript has been given should be locat in a vertic main rise from the boiler with it close end extend near across the pipe where non return valv are use or where there are horizont connect

onli a save in the prime mover a save which is at least partial offset by an increas in the fuel consumpt of the boiler generat steam this misconcept is due to the fact that the fuel consumpt of the boiler is onli consid in connect with a definit weight of steam it is true that where such a definit weight is to be superh an ad amount of fuel must be burn with a proper design superheat where the combin effici of the boiler and superheat will be at least as high as of a boiler alon the approxim increas in coal consumpt for produc a given weight of steam will be as follow superheat ad fuel degre per cent 25 159 50 307 75 438 100 569 150 819 200 1058 these figur repres the ad fuel necessari for superh a definit weight of steam to the number of degre as given the standard basi howev of boiler evapor is one of heat unit and consid from such a standpoint again provid the effici of the boiler and superheat is as high as of a boiler alon there is no addit fuel requir to generat steam contain a definit number of heat unit whether such unit be due to superheat or satur that is if 6 per cent more fuel is requir to generat and superheat to 100 degre a definit weight of steam over what would be requir to produc the same weight of satur steam that steam when superh will contain 6 per cent more heat unit abov the fuel water temperatur than if satur this hold true if the effici of the boiler and superheat combin is the same as of the boiler alon as a matter of fact the effici of a boiler and superheat where the latter is proper design and locat will be slight higher for the same set of furnac condit than would the effici of a boiler in which no superheat were instal a superheat proper place within the boiler set in such way that product of combust for generat satur steam are util as well for superh that steam will not in ani way alter furnac condit with a given set of such furnac condit for a given amount of coal burn the fact that addit surfac whether as boiler heat or superh surfac is place in such a manner that the gase must sweep over it will tend to lower the temperatur of the exit gase it is such a lower of exit gas temperatur that is the ultim indic of ad effici though the amount of this ad effici is difficult to determin by test that there is an increas is unquestion where a proper design superheat is instal in a boiler the heat surfac of the boiler proper in the generat of a definit number of heat unit is reliev of a portion of the work which would be requir were these heat unit deliv in satur steam such a superheat need practic no attent is not subject to a larg upkeep cost or depreci and perform it function without in ani way interf with the oper of the boiler it use therefor from the standpoint of the boiler room result in a save in wear and tear due to the lower rate at which the boiler may be run or it use will lead to the possibl of obtain the same number of boiler hors power from a smaller number of boiler with the boiler heat surfac do exact the same amount of work as if the superheat were not instal the save due to the ad boiler effici that will be obtain is obvious follow the cours of the steam in a plant the next advantag of the use of superh steam is the absenc of water in the steam pipe the thermal conduct of superh steam that is it power to give up it heat to surround bodi is much lower than that of satur steam and it heat therefor will not be transmit so rapid to the wall of the pipe as when satur steam is flow through the pipe the loss of heat radiat from a steam pipe assum no loss in pressur repres the equival condens when the pipe is carri satur steam in well cover steam main the heat lost by radiat when carri superh steam is accompani onli by a reduct of the superheat which if it be suffici high at the boiler will enabl a consider amount of heat to be radiat and still deliv dri or superh steam to the prime mover it is in the prime mover that the advantag of the use of superh steam are most clear seen in an engin steam is admit into a space that has been cool by the steam exhaust dure the previous stroke the heat necessari to warm the cylind wall from the temperatur of the exhaust to that of the enter steam can be suppli onli by the enter steam if this steam be satur such an ad of heat to the wall at the expens of the heat of the enter steam result in the condens of a portion this initi condens is seldom less than from 20 to 30 per cent of the total weight of steam enter the cylind it is obvious that if the steam enter be superh it must be reduc to the temperatur of satur steam at the correspond pressur befor ani condens can take place if the steam be superh suffici to allow a reduct in temperatur equival to the quantiti of heat that must be impart to the cylind wall and still remain superh it is clear that initi condens is avoid for exampl assum one pound of satur steam at 200 pound gaug pressur to enter a cylind which has been cool by the exhaust assum the initi condens to be 20 per cent the latent heat of the steam is given up in condens henc 20 × 838 = 1676 b t u are given up by the steam if one pound of superh steam enter the same cylind it would have to be superh to a point where it total heat is 1199 + 168 = 1367 b t u or at 200 pound gaug pressur superh approxim 325 degre if the heat given up to the cylind wall were the same as for the satur steam as superh steam conduct heat less rapid than satur steam the amount of heat impart will be less than for the satur steam and consequ the amount of superheat requir to prevent condens will be less than the abov figur this of cours is the extrem case of a simpl engin with the rang of temperatur chang a maximum as cylind are ad the rang in each is decreas and the condens is proportion the true economi of the use of superh steam is best shown in a comparison of the heat consumpt of an engin this is the number of heat unit requir in develop one indic hors power and the measur of the relat perform of two engin is base on a comparison of their heat consumpt as the measur of a boiler is base on it evapor from and at 212 degre the water consumpt of an engin in pound per indic hors power is in no sens a true indic of it effici the initi pressur and correspond temperatur may differ wide and thus make a differ in the temperatur of the exhaust and henc in the temperatur of the condens steam return to the boiler for exampl suppos a certain weight of steam at 150 pound absolut pressur and 358 degre be expand to atmospher pressur the temperatur then be 212 degre if the same weight of steam be expand from an initi pressur of 125 pound absolut and 344 degre to enabl it to do the same amount of work that is to give up the same amount of heat expans then must be carri to a point below atmospher pressur to say 13 pound absolut the final temperatur of the steam then be 206 degre in actual practic it has been observ that the water consumpt of a compound piston engin run on 26 inch vacuum and return the condens steam at 140 degre was approxim the same as when run on 28 inch vacuum and return water at 90 degre with an equal water consumpt for the two set of condit the economi in the former case would be greater than in the latter sinc it would be necessari to add less heat to the water return to the boiler to rais it to the steam temperatur the lower the heat consumpt of an engin per indic hors power the higher it economi and the less the number of heat unit must be impart to the steam generat this in turn lead to the lower of the amount of fuel that must be burn per indic hors power with the save in fuel by the reduct of heat consumpt of an engin indic it remain to be shown the effect of the use of superh steam on such heat consumpt as alreadi explain the use of superh steam reduc condens not onli in the main but especi in the steam cylind leav a greater quantiti of steam avail to do the work furthermor a portion of the satur steam introduc into a cylind will condens dure adiabat expans this condens increas as expans progress sinc superh steam cannot condens until it becom satur not onli is initi condens prevent by it use but also such condens as would occur dure expans when superh suffici steam deliv by the exhaust will still be dri in the avoid of such condens there is a direct save in the heat consumpt of an engin the heat given up be util in the develop of power and not in chang the condit of the work fluid that is while the number of heat unit lost in overcom condens effect would be the same in either case when satur steam is condens the water of condens has no power to do work while the superh steam even after it has lost a like number of heat unit still has the power of expans the save through the use of superh steam in the heat consumpt of an engin decreas demand on the boiler and henc the fuel consumpt per unit of power superh steam for steam turbinesexperi in use superh steam in connect with steam turbin has shown that it lead to economi and that it undoubt pay to use superh steam in place of satur steam this is so well establish that it is standard practic to use superh steam in connect with steam turbin asid from the economi secur through use superh steam there is an import advantag aris through the fact that it materi reduc the eros of the turbin blade by the action of water that would be carri by satur steam in use satur steam in a steam turbin or piston engin the work done on expand the steam caus condens of a portion of the steam so that even were the steam dri on enter the turbin it would contain water on leav the turbin by superh the steam the water that exist in the low pressur stage of the turbin may be reduc to an amount that will not caus troubl again if satur steam contain moistur the effect of this moistur on the economi of a steam turbin is to reduc the economi to a greater extent than the proport by weight of water one per cent of water caus approxim a fall off of 2 per cent in the economi the water rate of a larg econom steam turbin with superh steam is reduc about one per cent for everi 12 degre of superheat up to 200 degre fahrenheit of superheat to superheat one pound of steam 12 degre requir about 7 b t u and if 1050 b t u are requir at the boiler to evapor one pound of the satur steam from the temperatur of the feed water the heat requir for the superh steam would be 1057 degre one per cent of save therefor in the water consumpt would correspond to a net save of about one third of one per cent in the coal consumpt on this basi 100 degre of superheat with an econom steam turbin would result in somewhat over 3 per cent of save in the coal for equal boiler effici as a boiler with a proper design superheat place within the set is more econom for a given capac than a boiler without a superheat the minimum gain in the coal consumpt would be say 4 or 5 per cent as compar to a plant with the same boiler without superheat the abov estim are on the basi of a thorough dri satur steam or steam just at the point of be superh or contain a few degre of superheat if the satur steam is moist the save due to superheat is more and ordinarili the gain in economi due to superh steam for equal boiler effici as compar with commerci dri steam is say 5 per cent for each 100 degre of superheat asid from this gain as alreadi state superh steam prevent eros of the turbin bucket that would be caus by water in the steam and for the reason enumer it is standard practic to use superh steam for turbin work the less econom the steam motor the more the gain due to superh steam and where there are a number of auxiliari that are run with superh steam the percentag of gain will be greater than the figur given abov which are the minimum and are for the most econom type of larg steam turbin an exampl from actual practic will perhap best illustr and emphas the forego fact in octob 1909 a seri of compar test were conduct by the babcock and wilcox co on the steam yacht idalia to determin the steam consumpt both with satur and superh steam of the main engin on that yacht includ as well the feed pump circul pump and air pump these test are more repres than are most test of like charact in that the save in the steam consumpt of the auxiliari which were much more wast than the main engin form an import factor a resum of these test was publish in the journal

plant as a whole where superh steam is furnish not onli to the main engin but also to the auxiliari the figur may be taken as conserv for the reason that in addit to the save as shown in the tabl there would be in an ordinari plant a save much greater than is general realiz in the drip where the loss with satur steam is great in excess of that with superh steam the most conclus and most practic evid that a save is possibl through the use of superh steam is in the fact that in the largest and most econom plant it is use almost without except regardless of ani such evid howev there is a deep root convict in the mind of certain engin that the use of superh steam will involv oper difficulti which with addit first cost will more than offset ani fuel save there are of cours condit under which the instal of superheat would in no way be advis with a poor design superheat no gain would result in general it may be state that in a new plant proper design with a boiler and superheat which will have an effici at least as high as a boiler without a superheat a gain is certain such a gain is depend upon the class of engin and the power plant equip in general in determin the advis of make a superheat instal all of the factor enter into each individu case should be consid and balanc with a view to determin the save in relat to cost mainten depreci etc in high econom plant where the water consumpt for an indic hors power is low the gain will be less than would result from the use of superh steam in less econom plant where the water consumpt is higher it is imposs to make an accur statement as to the save possibl but broad it may vari from 3 to 5 per cent for 100 degre of superheat in the larg and econom plant use turbin or steam engin in which there is a larg ratio of expans to from 10 to 25 per cent for 100 degre of superheat for the less econom steam motor though a proper design superheat will tend to rais rather than to decreas the boiler effici it doe not follow that all superheat are effici for if the gase in pass over the superheat do not follow the path they would ordinarili take in pass over the boiler heat surfac a loss may result this is notic true where part of the gase are pass over the superheat and are allow to pass over onli a part or in some case none of the boiler heat surfac with moder degre of superheat from 100 to 200 degre where the pipe is proper instal there will be no greater oper difficulti than with satur steam engin and turbin builder guarante satisfactori oper with superh steam with high degre of superheat say over 250 degre apparatus of a special natur must be use and it is question whether the addit care and liabil to oper difficulti will offset ani fuel save accomplish it is well establish howev that the oper difficulti with the degre of superheat to which this articl is limit have been entir overcom the use of cast iron fit with superh steam has been wide discuss it is an undoubt fact that while in some instanc superh steam has caus deterior of such fit in other cast iron fit have been use with 150 degre of superheat without the least difficulti the qualiti of the cast iron use in such fit has doubtless a larg bear on the life of such fit for this servic the difficulti that have been encount are an increas in the size of the fit and eventu a deterior great enough to lead to serious breakag the develop of crack and when flang are drawn up too tight the break of a flang from the bodi of the fit the latter difficulti is undoubt due in certain instanc to the form of flang in which the strain of the connect bolt tend to distort the metal the babcock and wilcox co have use steel cast in superh steam work over a long period and experi has shown that this metal is suitabl for the servic there seem to be a general tendenc toward the use of steel fit in european practic until recent cast iron was use with appar satisfactori result the claim of european engin was to the effect

combust with the theoret amount of air and an excess may be requir amount to sometim doubl the theoret suppli depend upon the natur of the fuel to be burn and the method of burn it the reason for this is that it is imposs to bring each particl of oxygen in the air into intim contact with the particl in the fuel that are to be oxid due not onli to the dilut of the oxygen in the air by nitrogen but becaus of such factor as the irregular thick of the fire the vari resist to the passag of the air through the fire in separ part on account of ash clinker etc where the difficulti of draw air uniform through a fuel bed are elimin as in the case of burn oil fuel or gas the air suppli may be materi less than would be requir for coal experi has shown that coal will usual requir 50 per cent more than the theoret net calcul amount of air or about 18 pound per pound of fuel either under natur or forc draft though this amount may vari wide with the type of furnac the natur of the coal and the method of fire if less than this amount of air is suppli the carbon burn to monoxid instead of dioxid and it full heat valu is not develop an excess of air is also a sourc of wast as the product of combust will be dilut and carri off an excess amount of heat in the chimney gase or the air will so lower the temperatur of the furnac gase as to delay the combust to an extent that will caus carbon monoxid to pass off unburn from the furnac a suffici amount of carbon monoxid in the gase may caus the action known as secondari combust by ignit or mingl with air after leav the furnac or in the flue or stack such secondari combust which take place either within the set after leav the furnac or in the flue or stack alway lead to a loss of effici and in some instanc lead to overh of the flue and stack

that no matter what the excess of air suppli the actual amount of carbon dioxid per pound of carbon remain the same while the percentag by volum decreas as the excess of air increas the actual volum of oxygen and the percentag by volum increas with the excess of air and the percentag of oxygen is therefor an indic of the amount of excess air in each case the sum of the percentag of co {2} and o is the same 209 although the volum of nitrogen increas with the excess of air it percentag by volum remain the same as it undergo no chang while combust take place it percentag for ani amount of air excess therefor will be the same after combust as befor if cool to the same temperatur it must be born in mind that the abov condit hold onli for the perfect combust of a pound of pure carbon carbon monoxid co produc by the imperfect combust of carbon will occupi twice the volum of the oxygen enter into it composit and will increas the volum of the flue gase over that of the air suppli for combust in the proport of 100 + ½ the per cent co 1 to 100 when pure carbon is the fuel the sum of the percentag by volum of carbon dioxid oxygen and one half of the carbon monoxid must be in the same ratio to the nitrogen in the flue gase as is the oxygen to the nitrogen in the air suppli that is 2091 to 7909 when burn coal howev the percentag of nitrogen is obtain by subtract the sum of the percentag by volum of the other gase from 100 thus if an analysi show 125 per cent co {2} 65 per cent o and 06 per cent co the percentag of nitrogen which ordinarili is the onli other constitu of the gas which need be consid is found as follow 100 125 + 65 + 06 = 804 per cent the action of the hydrogen in the volatil constitu of the fuel is to increas the appar percentag of the nitrogen in the flue gase this is due to the fact that the water vapor form by the combust of the hydrogen will condens at a temperatur at which the analysi is made while the nitrogen which accompani the oxygen with which the hydrogen origin combin maintain it gaseous form and pass into the sampl apparatus with the other gase for this reason coal contain high percentag of volatil matter will produc a larger quantiti of water vapor and thus increas the appar percentag of nitrogen air requir and suppliedwhen the ultim analysi of a fuel is known the air requir for complet combust with no excess can be found as shown in the chapter on combust or from the follow approxim formula pound of air requir per pound of fuel = c o s 3456 + h + 29 11 3 8 8 where c h and o equal the percentag by weight of carbon hydrogen and oxygen in the fuel divid by 100 when the flue gas analysi is known the total amount of air suppli is pound of air suppli per pound of fuel = n 3036 × c30 12 co {2} + co where n co {2} and co are the percentag by volum of nitrogen carbon dioxid and carbon monoxid in the flue gase and c the percentag by weight of carbon which is burn from the fuel and pass up the stack as flue gas this percentag of c which is burn must be distinguish from the percentag of c as found by an ultim analysi of the fuel to find the percentag of c which is burn deduct from the total percentag of carbon as found in the ultim analysi the percentag of unconsum carbon found in the ash this latter quantiti is the differ between the percentag of ash found by an analysi and that as determin by a boiler test it is usual assum that the entir combust element in the ash is carbon which assumpt is practic correct thus if the ash in a boiler test were 16 per cent and by an analysi contain 25 per cent of carbon the percentag of unconsum carbon would be 16 × 25 = 4 per cent of the total coal burn if the coal contain by ultim analysi 80 per cent of carbon the percentag burn and of which the product of combust pass up the chimney would be 80 4 = 76 per cent which is the correct figur to use in calcul the total amount of air suppli by formula 12 the weight of flue gase result from the combust of a pound of

anthracit and high grade bitumin coal though as yet they cannot be said to have been open up weather of coalth storag of coal has becom within the last few year to a certain extent a necess due to market condit danger of labor difficulti at the mine and in the railroad and the crowd of transport facil the first caus is probabl the most import and this is particular true of anthracit coal where a slide scale of price is use accord to the season of the year while market condit serv as one of the princip reason for coal storag most power plant and manufactur plant feel compel to protect their coal suppli from the danger of strike car shortag and the like and it is customari for larg power plant railroad and coal compani themselv to store bitumin coal naval coal station are also an exampl of what is done along these line anthracit is the nearest approach to the ideal coal for store it is not subject to spontan ignit and for this reason is unlimit in the amount that may be store in one pile with bitumin coal howev the case is differ most bitumin coal will ignit if place in larg enough pile and all suffer more or less from disintegr coal produc onli store such coal as are least liabl to ignit and which will stand rehandl for shipment the chang which take place in store coal are of two kind 1st the oxid of the inorgan matter such as pyrit and 2nd the direct oxid of the organ matter of the actual coal the first chang will result in an increas volum of the coal and sometim in an increas weight and a mark disintegr the chang due to direct oxid of the coal substanc usual cannot be detect by the eye but as they involv the oxid of the carbon and avail hydrogen and the absorpt of the oxygen by unsatur hydrocarbon they are the chief caus of the weather loss in heat valu numer experi have led to the conclus that this is also the caus for spontan combust experi to show loss in calorif heat valu due to weather indic that such loss may be as high as 10 per cent when the coal is store in the air and 875 per cent when store under water it would appear that the higher the volatil content of the coal the greater will be the loss in calorif valu and the more subject to spontan ignit some experi made by messr s w parr and w f wheeler publish in 1909 by the experi station of the univers of illinoi indic that coal of the natur found in illinoi and neighbor state are not affect serious dure storag from the standpoint of weight and heat valu the latter loss averag about 31/2 per cent for the first year of storag they found that the loss due to disintegr and to spontan ignit were of greater import their conclus agre with those deduc from the other experi viz that the store of a larger size coal than that which is to be use will overcom to a certain extent the object to disintegr and that the larger size besid be advantag in respect to disintegr are less liabl to spontan ignit storag under water will of cours entir prevent ani fire loss and to a great extent will stop disintegr and reduc the calorif loss to a minimum to minim the danger of spontan ignit in store coal the pile should be thorough ventil pulver fuelsconsider experiment work has been done with

method of calorimet determin the remark appli to coal are equal applic to ani solid fuel and such chang in method as are necessari for liquid fuel will be self evid from the same descript approxim one gram of the pulver dri coal sampl should be place direct in the pan of the calorimet there is some danger in the use of a pulver sampl from the fact that some of it may be blown out of the pan when oxygen is admit this may be at least partial overcom by form about two gram into a briquett by the use of a cylind equip with a plunger and a screw press such a briquett should be broken and approxim one gram use if a pulver sampl is use care should be taken to admit oxygen slowli to prevent blow the coal out of the pan the weight of the sampl is limit to approxim one gram sinc the calorimet is proport for the combust of about this weight when under an oxygen pressur of about 25 atmospher a piec of fine iron wire is connect to the lower end of the plunger to form a fuse for ignit the sampl the weight of iron wire use is determin and if after combust a portion has not been burn the weight of such portion is determin in place the sampl in the pan and in adjust the fuse the top of the calorimet is remov it is then replac and care screw into place on the bomb by mean of a long handl wrench furnish for the purpos the bomb is then place in the calorimet which has been fill with a definit amount of water this weight is the water equival of the apparatus i e the weight of water the temperatur of which would be increas one degre for an equival increas in the temperatur of the combin apparatus it may be determin by calcul from the weight and specif heat of the various part of the apparatus such a determin is liabl to error howev as the weight of the bomb line can onli be approxim and a consider portion of the apparatus is not submerg anoth method of make such a determin is by the ad of definit weight of warm water to definit amount of cooler water in the calorimet and take an averag of a number of experi the best method for the make of such a determin is probabl the burn of a definit amount of resublim naphthalin whose heat of combust is known the temperatur of the water in the water jacket of the calorimet should be approxim that of the surround atmospher the temperatur of the weigh amount of water in the calorimet is made by some experiment slight greater than that of the surround air in order that the initi correct for radiat will be in the same direct as the final correct other experiment start from a temperatur the same or slight lower than the temperatur of the room on the basi that the temperatur after combust will be slight higher than the room temperatur and the radiat correct be either a minimum or entir elimin while no experi have been made to show conclus which of these method is the better the latter is general use after the bomb has been place in the calorimet it is fill with oxygen from a tank until the pressur reach from 20 to 25 atmospher the lower pressur will be suffici in all but except case connect is then made to a current from the dri batteri in seri so arrang as to allow complet of the circuit with a switch the current from a light system should not be use for ignit as there is danger from spark in burn the fuse which may effect the result the apparatus is then readi for the test unquestion the best method of take data is by the use of co ordin paper and a plot of the data with temperatur and time interv as ordin and abscissa such a graphic represent is shown in fig 25 graph temperaturedeg c against timehour and minut fig 25 graphic method of record bomb calorimet result after the bomb is place in the calorimet and befor the coal is ignit read of the temperatur of the water should be taken at one minut interv for a period long enough to insur a constant rate of chang and in this way determin the initi radiat the coal is then ignit by complet the circuit the temperatur at the instant the circuit is close be consid the temperatur at the begin of the combust after ignit the read should be taken at one half minut interv though becaus of the rapid of the mercuri rise approxim read onli may be possibl for at least a minut after the fire such read howev be suffici accur for this period the one half minut read should be taken after ignit for five minut and for say five minut longer at minut interv to determin accur the final rate of radiat fig 25 show the result of such read plot in accord with the method suggest it now remain to comput the result from this plot data the radiat correct is first appli probabl the most accur manner of make such correct is by the use of pfaundler method which is a modif of that of regnault this assum that in start with an initi rate of radiat as repres by the inclin of the line ab fig 25 and end with a final radiat repres by the inclin of the line cd fig 25 that the rate of radiat for the intermedi temperatur between the point b and c are proport to the initi and final rate that is the rate of radiat at a point midway between b and c will be the mean between the initi and final rate the rate of radiat at a point three quarter of the distanc between b and c would be the rate at b plus three quarter of the differ in rate at b and c etc this method differ from regnault in that the radiat was assum by regnault to be in each case proport to the differ in temperatur between the water of the calorimet and the surround air plus a constant found for each experi pfaundler method is more simpl than that of regnault and the result by the two method are in practic agreement express as a formula pfaundler method is though not in form given by him r r c = nr + t t 19 t t where c = correct in degre centigrad n = number of interv over which correct is made r = initi radiat in degre per interv r = final radiat in degre per interv t = averag temperatur for period through which initi radiat is comput t = averag temperatur over period of combustion39 t = averag temperatur over period through which final radiat is computed39 the applic of this formula to fig 25 is as follow as alreadi state the temperatur at the begin of combust is the read just befor the current is turn on or b in fig 25 the point c or the temperatur at which combust is presum complet should be taken at a point which fall well within the establish final rate of radiat and not at the maximum temperatur that the thermomet indic in the test unless it lie on the straight line determin the final radiat this is due to the fact that in certain instanc local condit will caus the thermomet to read higher than it should dure the time that the bomb is transmit heat to the water rapid and at other time the maximum temperatur might be lower than that which would be indic were read to be taken at interv of less than one half minut i e the point of maximum temperatur will fall below the line determin by the final rate of radiat with this understand ab fig 25 repres the time of initi radiat bc the time of combust and cd the time of final radiat therefor to appli pfaundler correct formula 19 to the data as repres by fig 25 n = 6 r = 0 r = 01 t = 2029 t = 2283 2029 + 2254 + 2284 + 2288 + 2287 + 2286 t = = 2236 6 01 0 c = 60 + 2236 2029 2285 2029 = 6 × 008 = 048 pfaundler formula while simpl is rather long mr e h peabodi has devis a simpler formula with which under proper condit the variat from correct as found by pfaundler method is neglig it was note throughout an extend seri of calorimet test that the maximum temperatur was reach by the thermomet slight over one minut after the time of fire if this period between the time of fire and the maximum temperatur report was exact one minut the radiat through this period would equal the radiat per one half minut befor fire plus the radiat per one half minut after the maximum temperatur is reach or the radiat through the one minut interv would be the averag of the radiat per minut befor fire and the

titrat solut use is equival to a correct of 265 calori as part of acid is due to the format of sulphur acid a further correct is necessari in burn sulphur acid the heat evolv per gram of sulphur is 2230 calori in excess of the heat which would be evolv if the sulphur burn to sulphur dioxid or 223 calori for each per cent of sulphur in the coal one cubic centimet of the ammonia solut is equival to 000286 gram of sulphur as sulphur acid or to 0286 × 223 = 638 calori it is evid therefor that after multipli the number of cubic centimet use in titrat by the heat factor for nitric acid 265 a further correct of 638 265 = 373 is necessari for each cubic centimet use in titrat sulphur instead of nitric acid this correct will be 373/0297 = 13 unit for each 001 gram of sulphur in the coal the total correct therefor for the aqueous nitric and sulphur acid is found by multipli the ammonia by 265 and ad 13 calori for each 001 gram of sulphur in the coal this total correct is to be deduct from

caus the difficulti and it is essenti that the furnac be design to proper handl this portion of the coal the fix carbon will take care of itself provid the volatil matter is proper burn mr kent in his steam boiler economi describ the action of bitumin coal after it is fire as follow the first thing that the fine fresh coal doe is to choke the air space exist through the bed of coke thus shut off the air suppli which is need to burn the gase produc from the fresh coal the next thing is a veri rapid evapor of moistur from the coal a chill process which rob the furnac of heat next is the format of water gas by the chemic reaction c + h {2}o = co + 2h the steam be decompos it oxygen burn the carbon of the coal to carbon oxid and the hydrogen be liber this reaction take place when steam is brought in contact with high heat carbon this also is a chill process absorb heat from the furnac the two valuabl fuel gase thus generat would give back all the heat absorb in their format if they could be burn but there is not enough air in the furnac to burn them admit extra air through the fire door at this time will be of no servic for the gase be compar cool cannot be burn unless the air is high heat after all the moistur has been driven off from the coal the distil of hydrocarbon begin and a consider portion of them escap unburn owe to the defici of hot air and to their be chill by the relat cool heat surfac of the boiler dure all this time great volum of smoke are escap from the chimney togeth with unburn hydrogen hydrocarbon and carbon oxid all fuel gase while at the same time soot is be deposit on the heat surfac diminish it effici in transmit heat to the water to burn these gase distil from the coal it is necessari that they be brought into contact with air suffici heat to caus them to ignit that suffici space be allow for their mixtur with the air and that suffici time be allow for their complet combust befor they strike the boiler heat surfac sinc these surfac are compar cool and will lower the temperatur of the gase below their ignit point the air drawn through the fire by the draft suction is heat in it passag and heat is ad by radiat from the hot brick surfac of the furnac the air and volatil gase mix as this increas in temperatur is take place thus in most instanc is the first requir fulfil the element of space for the proper mixtur of the gase with the air and of time in which combust is to take place should be taken care of by suffici larg combust chamber certain bitumin coal owe to their high volatil content requir that the air be heat to a higher temperatur than it is possibl for it to attain simpli in it passag through the fire and by absorpt from the side wall of the furnac such coal can be burn with the best result under fire brick arch such arch increas the temperatur of the furnac and in this way maintain the heat that must be present for ignit and complet combust of the fuel in question these fuel too sometim requir addit combust space and an extens furnac will give this in addit to the requir arch as state the difficulti of burn bitumin coal success will increas with the increas in volatil matter this percentag of volatil will affect direct the depth of coal bed to be carri and the interv of fire for the most satisfactori result the variat in the fuel over such wide rang make it imposs to definit state the thick of fire for all class and experi with the class of fuel in use is the best method of determin how that particular fuel should be handl the follow suggest which are not to be consid in ani sens hard and fast rule may be of servic for general oper condit for hand fire semi bitumin coal such as pocahonta new river clearfield etc requir fire from 10 to 14 inch thick fresh coal should be fire at

coal requir a depth of about 4 inch in general as thin fire are found necessari the interv of fire should be made more frequent and the quantiti of coal fire at each interv smaller as thin fire becom necessari due to the charact of the coal the tendenc to clinker will increas if the thick be increas over that found to give the best result there are two general method of hand fire 1st the spread method and 2nd the coke method illustr babcock and wilcox chain grate stoker in the spread method but littl fuel is fire at one time and is spread even over the fuel bed from front to rear where there is more than one fire door the door should be fire altern the advantag of altern fire is the whole surfac of the fire is not blanket with green coal and steam is generat more uniform than if all door were fire at one time again a better combust result due to the burn of more of the volatil matter direct after fire than where all door are fire at one time in the coke method fresh coal is fire at consider depth at the front of the grate and after it is partial coke it is push back into the furnac the object of such a method is the preserv of a bed of carbon at the rear of the grate in pass over which the volatil gase driven off from the green coal will be burn this method is particular adapt to a grate in which the gase are made to pass horizont over the fire modern practic for hand fire lean more and more toward the spread fire method again the tendenc is to work bitumin coal fire less than former a certain amount of slice and rake may be necessari with either method of fire but in general the less the fire is work the better the result lignitesa the content of volatil matter and moistur in lignit is higher than in bitumin coal the difficulti encount in burn them are greater a larg combust space is requir and the best result are obtain where a furnac of the reverberatori type is use give the gase a long travel befor meet the tube surfac a fuel bed from 4 to 6 inch in depth can be maintain and the coal should be fire in small quantiti by the altern method abov certain rate of combust clinker form rapid and a steam jet in the ashpit for soften this clinker is often desir a consider draft should be avail but it should be care regul by the boiler damper to suit the condit of the fire smokeless with hand fire with this class of fuel is a practic imposs it has a

stoker feed coal to the fire automat but if the coal has first to be fed to the stoker hopper by hand it automat advantag is lost this is as true of the remov of ash from a stoker in a general way it may be state that a stoker instal is not advantag except possibl for diminish smoke unless the automat featur is carri to the handl of the coal and ash as where coal and ash handl apparatus is not instal there is no save in labor in larg plant howev stoker use in conjunct with the modern method of coal storag and coal and ash handl make possibl a larg labor save in small plant the labor save for stoker over hand fire furnac is neglig and the expens of the instal no less proportion than in larg plant stoker are therefor advis in small plant onli where the save in fuel will be larg or where the smoke question is import interest on invest repair depreci and steam requir for blast and stoker drive must all be consid the upkeep cost will in general be higher than for hand fire furnac stoker howev make possibl the use of cheaper fuel with as high or higher economi than is obtain under oper condit in hand fire furnac with a better grade of fuel the better effici obtain with a good stoker is due to more even and continu fire as against the intermitt fire of hand fire furnac constant air suppli as against a variat in this suppli to meet vari furnac condit in hand fire furnac and the do away to a great extent with the necess of work the fire stoker under ordinari oper condit will give more near smokeless combust than will hand fire furnac and for this reason must often be instal regardless of other consider while a constant air suppli for a given power is theoret secur by the use of a stoker and in mani instanc the draft is automat govern the air suppli should nevertheless be as care watch and check by flue gas analys as in the case of hand fire furnac there is a tendenc in all stoker to caus the loss of some good fuel or sift in the ashpit but suitabl arrang may be made to reclaim this in respect to effici of combust other condit be equal there will be no appreci differ with the differ type of stoker provid that the proper type is use for the grade of fuel to be burn

stoker are of three general type 1st overfe 2nd underfe and 3rd travel grate the travel grate stoker are sometim class as overfe but proper should be class by themselv as under certain condit they are of the underfe rather than the overfe type overfe stoker in general may be divid into two class the distinct be in the direct in which the coal is fed relat to the furnac in one class the coal is fed into hopper at the front end of the furnac onto grate with an inclin downward toward the rear of about 45 degre these grate are reciproc be made to take altern level and inclin posit and this motion gradual carri the fuel as it is burn toward the rear and bottom of the furnac at the bottom of the grate flat dump section are suppli for complet the combust and for clean the fuel is part burn or coke on the upper portion of the grate the volatil gase driven off in this process for a perfect action be ignit and burn in their passag over the bed of burn carbon lower on the grate or on becom mix with the hot gase in the furnac chamber in the second class the fuel is fed from the side of the furnac for it full depth from front to rear onto grate inclin toward the center of the furnac it is move by rock bar and is gradual carri to the bottom and center of the furnac as combust advanc here some type of a so call clinker breaker remov the refus underfe stoker are either horizont or inclin the fuel is fed from underneath either continu by a screw or intermitt by plunger the principl upon which these stoker base their claim for effici and smokeless is that the green fuel is fed under the coke and burn coal the volatil gase from this fresh fuel be heat and ignit in their passag through the hottest portion of the fire on the top in the horizont class of underfe stoker the action of a screw carri the fuel back through a retort from which it pass upward as the fuel abov is consum the ash be final deposit on dead plate on either side of the retort from which it can be remov in the inclin class the refus is carri downward to the rear of the furnac where there are dump plate as in some of the overfe type underfe stoker are ordinarili oper with a forc blast this in some case be oper by the same mechan as the stoker drive thus automat meet the requir of various combust rate travel grate are of the class best illustr by chain grate stoker as impli by the name these consist of endless grate compos of short section of bar pass over sprocket at the front and rear of the furnac coal is fed by graviti onto the forward end of the grate through suitabl hopper is ignit under ignit

rear end by the grate in make the turn over the rear sprocket in some case auxiliari dump grate at the rear of the chain grate are use with success chain grate stoker in general produc less smoke than either overfe or underfe type due to the fact that there are no clean period necessari such period occur with the latter type of stoker at interv depend upon the charact of the fuel use and the rate of combust with chain grate stoker the clean is continu and automat and no period occur when smoke will necessarili be produc in the earlier form chain grate had an objection featur in that the admiss of larg amount of excess air at the rear of the furnac through the grate was possibl this object has been larg overcom in recent model by the use of some such devic as the bridg wall water box and suitabl damper a distinct advantag of chain grate over other type is that they can be withdrawn from the furnac for inspect or repair without interf in ani way with the boiler set this class of stoker is particular success in burn low grade of coal run high in ash and volatil matter which can onli be burn with difficulti on the other type the cost of up keep in a chain grate proper construct and

can be diminish by give the gase a long travel under the action of heat brickwork befor they strike the boiler heat surfac air introduc over the fire and the use of heat arch etc for mingl the air with the gase distil from the coal will also diminish smoke extens furnac will undoubt lessen smoke where hand fire is use due to the increas in length of gas travel and the fact that this travel is partial under heat brickwork where hand fire grate are immedi under the boiler tube and a high volatil coal is use if suffici combust space is not provid the volatil gase distil as soon as the coal is

it is essenti in the burn of this class of fuel that a larg combust space be suppli and on account of the usual high moistur content there should be much heat brickwork to radiat heat to the fuel bed and thus evapor the moistur extens furnac of the proper size are usual essenti for good result and when this fuel is use alon grate drop to the floor line with an ashpit below give addit volum for

best to feed it automat into the furnac through chute on the top of the extens the best result are secur when the fuel is allow to pile up in the furnac to a height of 3 or 4 feet in the form of a

35 squar feet of grate surfac while larg quantiti of air are requir for burn this fuel excess air is as harm as with coal and care must be taken that such an excess is not admit through fire door or fuel chute a strong natur draft usual is prefer to a blast with this fuel the action of blast is to make the regul of the furnac condit more difficult and to blow over unconsum fuel on the heat surfac

method of handl and collect sawdust by mean of air suction and blast were such that the amount of air admit through such chute was excess but with improv method the amount of air so admit may be reduc to a neglig quantiti the block and refus which cannot be handl through chute may be fire through fire door in the front of the boiler which should be made suffici larg to accommod the larger size of

front and rear wall of the furnac should be corbel out to cover about one third of the total grate surfac this prevent cold air from lane up the side of the furnac and also reduc the grate surfac cord wood and slab form an open fire through which the friction loss of the air is much less than in the case of sawdust or hog materi the combust rate with cord wood is therefor higher and the grate

sugar cane from which the juic has been extract by pressur between the roll of the mill from the start of the sugar industri bagass has been consid the natur fuel for sugar plantat and in view of the import of the industri a word of histori relat to the use of this fuel is not out of place when the manufactur of sugar was in it infanc the cane was pass through but a singl mill and the defec and concentr of the saccharin juic took place in a seri of vessel mount one after anoth over a common fire at one end and connect to a stack at the opposit end this primit method was known in the english coloni as the open wall and in the spanish american countri as the jamaica train the evapor and concentr of the juic in the open air and over a direct fire requir such quantiti of fuel and the bagass in fact play such an import part in the manufactur of sugar that oftentim the degre of extract which was alreadi low would be sacrif to the necess of obtain a bagass that might be readili burn the furnac in use with these method were as primit as the rest of the apparatus and the bagass could be burn in them onli by first dri it this natur requir an enorm quantiti of handl of the fuel in spread and collect and frequent entail a shut down of the mill becaus a shower would spoil the suppli which had been dri the difficulti aris from the necess of dri this fuel caus a widespread attempt on the part of inventor to the turn out of a furnac which would success burn green bagass some of the design were more or less clever and about the year 1880 sever such green bagass furnac were instal these did not come up to expect howev and almost invari they were abandon and recours had to be taken to the old method of dri in the sun from 1880 the new era in the sugar industri may be date slaveri was almost univers abolish and it becam necessari to pay for labor the cost of product was thus increas while grow competit of european beet sugar lower the price the onli remedi for the new state of affair was the cheapen of the product by the increas of extract and improv in manufactur the doubl mill took the place of the singl the open wall method of extract was replac by vacuum evapor apparatus and centrifug machin were introduc to do the work of the great cure hous as oppos to these improv howev the steam plant remain as they start consist of doubl flue boiler extern fire with dri

grate import from louisiana and known as the leon mari furnac but satisfactori result were obtain in none of the applianc tri the babcock and wilcox co at this time turn their attent to the problem with the result which ultim led to it solut their new orlean repres mr frederick cook invent a hot forc blast bagass furnac and convey the patent right to this compani this furnac while not as effici as the standard of to day and expens in it construct did nevertheless burn the bagass green and enabl the boiler to develop their normal rate capac the first furnac of this type was instal at the southwood and mt houma plantat and on a small plantat in florida about the year 1888 two furnac were erect in cuba one on the plantat senado and the other at the central hormiguero the result obtain with these furnac were so remark in comparison with what had previous been accomplish that the compani was overwhelm with order the expens of auxiliari fuel usual wood which was cost and indispens in raini weather was done away with and as the mill could be oper on bagass alon the steam product and the factori work could be regul with natur increas in daili output progress and improv in the manufactur itself was go on at a remark rate the singl grind had been replac by a doubl grind this in turn by a third grind and final the macer and dilut of the bagass was carri to the extract of practic the last trace of sugar contain in it the quantiti of juic to be treat was increas in this way 20 or 30 per cent but was accompani by the reduct to a minimum of the bagass avail as a fuel and led to demand upon the furnac beyond it capac with the improv in the manufactur planter had been compel to make enorm sacrific to chang radic their system and the heavi disburs necessari for mill apparatus left few in a financi posit to make cost instal of good furnac the necess of turn to someth cheap in furnac construct but which was nevertheless better than the earli method of burn the fuel dri led to the invent of numer furnac by all class of engin regardless of their knowledg of the subject and base upon no experi none of the furnac thus produc were in ani sens invent but were more or less barefac infring of the patent of the babcock and wilcox co as the compani could not protect it right without hurt it client who in mani case against their own will were infring upon these patent and as on the other hand they were anxious to do someth to meet the want of the planter a seri of experi were start at their own rather than at their custom expens with a view to develop a furnac which without be as expens would still fulfil all the requir of the manufactur the result was the cold blast green bagass furnac which is now offer and it has been adopt as standard for this class of work after year of studi and observ in our instal in the sugar countri of the world such a furnac is describ later in consid the combust of bagass composit and calorif valu of bagasseth proport of

calorif valu the factor here enter are the age at which the cane must be cut the local in which it is grown etc from the analysi of ani sampl of bagass it approxim calorif valu may be calcul from the

per pound of bagass that is the heat generat per pound less the heat requir to evapor it moistur and superheat the steam thus form to the temperatur of the stack gase three sampl of bagass in which the ash is assum to be 3 per cent give from the formula f = 50 s and g = 45 w = 425 b t u = 4183 f = 40 s and g = 60 w = 510 b t u = 3351 f = 333 s and g = 70 w = 567 b t u = 2797 a sampl of java bagass have f = 465 s = 450 g = 05 w = 475 give b t u 3868 these figur show that the dryer the bagass is crush the higher the calorif valu though this is accompani by a decreas in sucros the explan lie in the fact that the presenc of sucros in an analysi is accompani by a definit amount of water and that the residu juic contain suffici organ substanc to evapor the water present when a fuel is burn in a furnac for exampl assum the residu juic 100 per cent to contain 12 per cent organ matter from the constant in formula 12x7119 100 12x972 = 8543 and = 8554 100 100 that is the moistur in a juic contain 12 per cent of sugar will be evapor by the heat develop by the combust of the contain sugar it would therefor appear that a bagass contain such juic has a calorif valu due onli to it fiber content this is of cours true onli where the highest product of oxid are form dure the combust of the organ matter this is not strict the case especi with a bagass of a high moistur content which will not burn proper but which smoulder and produc a larg quantiti of product of destruct distil chiefli heavi hydrocarbon which escap unburnt the reason howev is suffici to explain the steam make properti of bagass of a low sucros content such as are secur in java as when the sucros content is lower the heat valu is increas by extract more juic and henc more sugar from it the sugar oper in java exemplifi this and show that with a high dilut by macer and heavi pressur the bagass meet all of the steam requir of the mill without auxiliari fuel a high percentag of silica or salt in bagass has sometim been ascrib as the reason for the tendenc to smoulder in certain case of soft fiber bagass this howev is due to the larg moistur content of the sampl result direct from the natur of the cane solubl salt in the bagass has also been given as the explan of such smoulder action of the fire but here too the explan lie sole in the high moistur content this result in the develop of onli

requir is fulfil by proper introduc the air into the furnac either through checkerwork under the burner or through open around them and by control the quantiti of air to meet variat in furnac condit the third requir is provid for by instal a furnac so design as to give a suffici area of heat brickwork to radiat the heat requir to maintain a proper furnac temperatur the fourth requir is provid for by give ampl space for the combust of the mixtur of atom oil and air and a gas travel of suffici length to insur that this combust be complet befor the gase strike the heat surfac the fifth requir is fulfil by the adopt of a suitabl burner in connect with the furnac meet the other requir a burner must be use from which the flame will not imping direct on the heat surfac and must be locat where such action cannot take place if suitabl burner proper locat are not use not onli is the heat local with disastr result but the effici is lower by the cool of the gase befor combust is complet oil burnersth function of an oil burner is to atom or vapor the fuel so that it may be burn like a gas all burner may be classifi under three general type 1st spray burner in which the oil is atom by steam or compress air 2nd vapor burner in which the oil is convert into vapor and then pass into the furnac 3rd mechan burner in which the oil is atom by submit it to a high pressur and pass it through a small orific vapor burner have never been in general use and will not be discuss spray burner are almost univers use for land practic and the simplic of the steam atom and the excel economi of the better type togeth with the low oil pressur and temperatur requir make this type a favorit for stationari plant where the loss of fresh water is not a vital consider in marin work or in ani case where it is advis to save feed water that otherwis would have to be ad in the form of make up either compress air or mechan mean are use for atom spray burner use compress air as the atom agent are in satisfactori oper in some plant but their use is not general where there is no necess of save raw feed water the greater simplic and economi of the steam spray atom is general the most satisfactori the air burner requir blower compressor or other apparatus which occupi space that might be otherwis util and requir attent that is not necessari where steam is use steam spray burner of the older type had disadvantag in that they were so design that there was a tendenc for the nozzl to clog with sludg or coke form from the oil by the heat without mean of be readili clean this has been overcom in the more modern type steam spray burner as now use may be divid into two class 1st insid mixer and 2nd outsid mixer in the former the steam and oil come into contact within the burner and the mixtur is atom in pass through the orific of the burner nozzl illustr fig 28 peabodi oil burner in the outsid mix class the steam flow through a narrow slot or horizont row of small hole in the burner nozzl the oil flow through a similar slot or hole abov the steam orific and is pick up by the steam outsid of the burner and is atom fig 28 show a type of the peabodi burner of this class which has given emin satisfact the construct is evid from the cut it will be note that the portion of the burner form the orific may be readili replac in case of wear or if it is desir to alter the form of the flame where burner of the spray type are use heat the oil is of advantag not onli in caus it to be atom more easili but in aid econom combust the temperatur is of cours limit by the flash point of the oil use but within the limit of this temperatur there is no danger of decomposit or of carbon deposit on the suppli pipe such heat should be done close to the boiler to minim radiat loss if the temperatur is rais to a point where an appreci vapor occur the oil will flow irregular from the burner and caus the flame to sputter on both steam and air atom type a by pass should be instal between the steam or air and the oil pipe to provid for the blow out of the oil duct strainer should be provid for remov sludg from the fuel and should be so locat as to allow for rapid remov clean and replac mechan burner have been in use for some time in european countri but their introduct and use has been of onli recent occurr in the unit state here as alreadi state the mean for atom are pure mechan the most success of the mechan atom up to the present have been of the round flame type and onli these will be consid experi have been made with flat flame mechan burner but their satisfactori action has been confin to instanc where it is onli necessari to burn a small quantiti of oil through each individu burner this system of oil burn is especi adapt for marin work as the quantiti of steam for put pressur on the oil is small and the condens steam may be return to the system the onli method by which success mechan atom has been accomplish is one by which the oil is given a whirl motion within the burner tip this is done either by forc the oil through a passag of helic form or by deliv it tangenti to a circular chamber from which there is a central outlet the oil is fed to these burner under a pressur which vari with the make of the burner and the rate at which individu burner are use oil the oil particl fli off from such a burner in straight line in the form of a cone rather than in the form of a spiral spray as might be suppos with burner of the mechan atom design the method of introduc air for combust and the veloc of this air are of the greatest import in secur good combust and in the effect on the charact and shape of the flame such burner are locat at the front of the furnac and various method have been tri for introduc the air for combust where in the spray burner air is ordinarili admit through a checkerwork under the burner proper with the mechan burner it is almost univers admit around the burner earli experi with these air distributor were confin larg to singl or duplic cone use with the idea of direct the air to the axi of the burner a high success method of such air introduct develop by messr peabodi and irish of the babcock and wilcox co is by mean of what they term an impel plate this consist of a circular metal disk with an open at the center for the oil burner and with radial metal strip from the center to the peripheri turn at an angl which in the later design may be alter to give the air suppli demand by the rate of combust the air so admit doe not necessarili requir a whirl motion but experi show that where the air is brought into contact with the oil spray with the right twist better combust is secur and lower air pressur and less refin of adjust of individu burner are requir mechan burner have a distinct advantag over those in which steam is use as the atom agent in that they lend themselv more readili to adjust under wider variat of load for a given hors power there will ordinarili be instal a much greater number of mechan than steam atom burner this in itself is a mean to better regul for with the steam atom burner if one of a number is shut off there is a mark decreas in effici this is due to the fact that with the air admit under the burner it is ordinarili pass through the checkerwork regardless of whether it is be util for combust or not with a mechan burner on the other hand where individu burner are shut off air that would be admit for such burner were it in oper may also be shut off and there will be no undu loss from excess air further adjust to meet load condit is possibl by a chang in the oil pressur act on all burner at onc a good burner will atom moder heavi oil with an oil pressur as low as 30 pound per squar inch and from that point up to 200 pound or abov the heat of the oil also has an effect on the capac of individu burner and in this way a third method of adjust is given under work condit the oil pressur remain constant the capac of each burner will decreas as the temperatur of the oil is increas though at low temperatur the revers is the case some experi with a texa crude oil have a flash point of 210 degre show that the capac of a mechan atom burner of the peabodi type increas from 80 degre fahrenheit to 110 degre fahrenheit from which point it fell off rapid to 140 degre and then more slowli to the flash point the abov method togeth with the regul possibl through manipul of the boiler damper indic the wide rang of load condit that may be handl with an instal of this class of burner as has alreadi been state result with mechan atom burner that may be consid veri success have been limit almost entir to case where forc blast of some descript has been use the high veloc of the air enter be of materi assist in secur the proper mixtur of air with the oil spray much has been done and is be done in the way of experi with this class of apparatus toward develop a success mechan atom burner for use with natur draft and there appear to be no reason whi such experi should not eventu produc satisfactori result steam consumpt of burnersth bureau of steam engin u s navi made in 1901 an exhaust seri of test of various oil

improv in burner design has larg reduc the steam consumpt though to a greater degre in steam than in air atom burner recent experi show that a good steam atom burner will requir approxim 2 per cent of the total steam generat by the boiler oper at or about it rate capac this figur will decreas as the capac is increas and is so low as to be practic neglig except in case where the question of loss of feed water is all import there are no figur avail as to the actual steam consumpt of mechan atom burner but appar this is small if the requir is understood to be entir apart from the steam consumpt of the apparatus produc the forc blast capac of burnersa good steam atom burner proper locat in a well design oil furnac has a capac of somewhat over 400 hors power this question of capac of individu burner is larg one of the proper relat between the number of burner use and the furnac volum in some recent test with a babcock and wilcox boiler of 640 rate hors power equip with three burner approxim 1350 hors power was develop with an avail draft of 55 inch at the damper or 450 hors power per burner four burner were also tri in the same furnac but the total steam generat did not exceed 1350 hors power or in this instanc 338 hors power per burner from the natur of mechan atom burner individu burner have not as larg a capac as the steam atom class in some test on a babcock and wilcox marin boiler equip with mechan atom burner the maximum hors power develop per burner was approxim 105 here again the burner capac is larg one of proper relat between furnac volum and number of burner furnac designtoo much stress cannot be laid on the import of furnac design for the use of this class of fuel provid a good type of burner is adopt the furnac arrang and the method of introduc air for combust into the furnac are the all import factor no matter what the type of burner satisfactori result cannot be secur in a furnac not suit to the fuel the babcock and wilcox co has had much experi

stack to a size which will depend upon the size of the boiler unit use correct in stack size for altitudesit has ordinarili been assum that a stack height for altitud will be increas invers as the ratio of the barometr pressur at the altitud to that at sea level and that the stack diamet will increas invers as the two fifth power of this ratio such a relat has been base on the assumpt of constant draft measur in inch of water at the base of the stack for a given rate of oper of the boiler regardless of altitud if the assumpt be made that boiler flue and furnac remain the same and further that the increas veloc of a given weight of air pass through the furnac at a higher altitud would have no effect on the combust the theori has been advanced53 that a differ law appli under the abov assumpt whenev a stack is work at it maximum capac at ani altitud the entir draft is util in overcom the various resist each of which is proport to the squar of the veloc of the gase sinc boiler area are fix all veloc may be relat to a common veloc say that within the stack and all resist may therefor be express as proport to the squar of the chimney veloc the total resist to flow in term of veloc head may be express in term of weight of a column of extern air the numer valu of such head be independ of the barometr pressur likewis the draft of a stack express in height of column of extern air will be numer independ of the barometr pressur it is evid therefor that if a given boiler plant with it stack oper with a fix fuel be transplant from sea level to an altitud assum the temperatur remain constant the total draft head measur in height of column of extern air will be numer constant the veloc of chimney gase will therefor remain the same at altitud as at sea level and the weight of gase flow per second with a fix veloc will be proport to the atmospher densiti or invers proport to the normal barometr pressur to develop a given hors power requir a constant weight of chimney gas and air for combust henc as the altitud is increas the densiti is decreas and for the assumpt given abov the veloc through the furnac the boiler pass breech and flue must be correspond greater at altitud than at sea level the mean veloc therefor for a given boiler hors power and constant weight of gase will be invers proport to the barometr pressur and the veloc head measur in column of extern air will be invers proport to the squar of the barometr pressur for stack oper at altitud it is necessari not onli to increas the height but also the diamet as there is an ad resist within the stack due to the ad friction from the addit height this friction loss can be compens by a suitabl increas in the diamet and when so compens it is evid that on the assumpt as given the chimney height would have to be increas at a ratio invers proport to the squar of the normal barometr pressur in design a boiler for high altitud as alreadi state the assumpt is usual made that a given grade of fuel will requir the same draft measur in inch of water at the boiler damper as at sea level and this lead to make the stack height invers as the barometr pressur instead of invers as the squar of the barometr pressur the correct height no doubt fall somewher between the two valu as larger flue are usual use at the higher altitud wherea to obtain the ratio of the squar the flue must be the same size in each case and again the effect of an increas veloc of a given weight of air through the fire at a high altitud on the combust must be neglect in make capac test with coal fuel no differ has been note in the rate of combust for a given draft suction measur by a water column at high and low altitud and this would make it appear that the correct height to use is more near that obtain by the invers ratio of the barometr read than by the invers ratio of the squar of the barometr read if the assumpt is made that the valu fall midway between the two formula the error in use a stack figur in the ordinari way by make the height invers proport to the barometr read would differ about 10 per cent in capac at an altitud of 10000 feet which differ is well within the probabl variat of the size determin by differ method it would therefor appear that ampl accuraci is obtain in all case by simpli make the height invers proport to the barometr read and increas the diamet so that the stack use at high altitud have the same friction resist as those use at low altitud although if desir the stack may be made somewhat higher at high altitud than this rule call for in order to be on the safe side the increas of stack diamet necessari to maintain the same friction loss is invers as the two fifth power of the barometr pressur tabl 54 give the ratio of barometr read of various altitud to sea level

greater extent than the diamet and that practic no increas in diamet is necessari for altitud up to 3000 feet for high altitud the increas in stack height necessari is in some case such as to make the

from those where coal is use while more attent has been paid to the matter of stack size for oil fuel in recent year there has not as yet been gather the larg amount of experiment data avail for use in design coal stack in the case of oil fire boiler the loss of draft through the fuel bed is partial elimin while there may be practic no loss through ani checkerwork admit air to the furnac when a boiler is new the area for the air passag in this checkerwork will in a short time be decreas due to the silt which is present in practic all fuel oil the loss in draft through the boiler proper at a given rate will be less than in the case of coal fire boiler this be due to a decreas in the volum of the gase further the action of the oil burner itself is to a certain extent that of a forc draft to offset this decreas in draft requir the temperatur of the gase enter the stack will be somewhat lower where oil is use than where coal is use and the draft that a stack of a given height would give therefor decreas the factor as given abov affect as they do the intens of the draft affect direct the height of the stack to be use as alreadi state the volum of gase from oil fire boiler be less than in the case of coal make it evid that the area of stack for oil fuel will be less than for coal it is assum that these area will vari direct as the volum of the gase to be handl and this volum for oil may be taken as approxim 60 per cent of that for coal in design stack for oil fuel there are two featur which must not be overlook in coal fire practic there is rare danger of too much draft in the burn of oil howev this may play an import part in the reduct of plant economi the influenc of excess draft be more appar where the load on the plant may be reduc at interv the reason for this is that asid from a slight decreas in temperatur at reduc load the tendenc due to careless fire is toward a constant gas flow through the boiler regardless of the rate of oper with the correspond increas of excess air at light load with excess stack height econom oper at vari load is almost imposs with hand control with automat control howev where stack are necessarili high to take care of known peak under lighter load this econom oper becom less difficult for this reason the question of design a stack for a plant where the load is known to be near a constant is easier than for a plant where the load will vari over a wide rang while great care must be taken to avoid excess draft still more care must be taken to assur a draft suction within all part of the set under ani and all condit of oper it is veri easili possibl to more than offset the economi gain through low draft by the loss due to set deterior result from such lack of suction under condit where the suction is not suffici to carri

gas as in the case of oil fire boiler stack size as suit for coal fire will have to be modifi the diamet of stack for this work should be approxim the same as for coal fire boiler the volum of gase would be slight greater than from a coal fire and would decreas the draft with a given stack but such a decreas due to volum is about offset by an increas due to somewhat higher temperatur in the case of the blast furnac gase record show that with this class of fuel 175 per cent of the rate capac of a boiler can be develop with a draft at the boiler damper of from 075 inch to 10 inch and it is well to limit the height of stack to one which will give this draft as a maximum a stack of proper diamet 130 feet high abov the ground will produc such a draft and this height should ordinarili not be exceed until recent the question of economi in boiler fire with blast furnac gas has not been consid but asid from the econom standpoint excess draft should be guard against in order to lower the upkeep cost stack should be made of suffici height to produc a draft that will develop the maximum capac requir and this draft decreas proportion for load under the maximum by damper regul the amount of gas fed to a boiler for ani given rate is a fix quantiti and if a draft in excess of that requir for that particular rate of oper is suppli economi is decreas and the wear and tear on the set is materi increas excess air which is drawn in either through or around the gas burner by an excess draft will decreas economi as in ani other class of work again as in oil fire practic it is essenti on the other hand that a suction be maintain within all part of the set in this case not onli to provid against set deterior but to protect the oper from leakag of gas which is disagre and may be danger asid from the intens of the draft a poor mixtur of the gas and air or a lane action may lead to secondari combust with the possibl of danger explos within the set may caus a pulsat action within the

class of wood see chapter on wood burn furnac as economi is ordinarili of littl import high stack temperatur may be expect and often unavoid larg quantiti of excess air are suppli due to the method of

design a stack for boiler use wood fuel to consid each individu set of condit that exist rather than tri to follow ani general rule one factor not to be overlook in stack for wood burn is their locat the fine particl of this fuel are often carri unconsum through the boiler and where the stack is not on top of the boiler these particl may accumul in the base of the stack below the point at which the flue enter where there is ani air leakag through the base of such a stack this fuel may becom ignit and the stack burn where there is a possibl of such action take place it is well to line the

later under the select of boiler with refer to the work they are to accomplish the present chapter deal with the effici and capac onli with a view to make clear exact what is meant by these term as appli to steam generat apparatus togeth with the method of determin these factor by test efficiencyth term effici specif appli to a steam boiler is the ratio of heat absorb by the boiler in the generat of steam to the total amount of heat avail in the medium util in secur such generat when this medium is a solid fuel such as coal it is imposs to secur the complet combust of the total amount fed to the boiler a portion is bound to drop through the grate where it becom mix with the ash and remain unburn produc no heat obvious it is unfair to charg the boiler with the failur to absorb the portion of avail heat in the fuel that is wast in this way on the other hand the boiler user must pay for such wast and is justifi in charg it against the combin boiler and furnac due to this fact the effici of a boiler as ordinarili state is in realiti the combin effici of the boiler furnac and grate and effici of boiler} heat absorb per pound of fuel furnac and grate } = 31 heat valu per pound of fuel the effici will be the same whether base on dri fuel or on fuel as fire includ it content of moistur for exampl if the coal contain 3 per cent of moistur the effici would be heat absorb per pound of dri coal × 097 heat valu per pound of dri coal × 097 where 097 cancel and the formula becom 31 the heat suppli to the boiler is due to the combust portion of fuel which is actual burn irrespect of what proport of the total combust fire may be54 this fact has led to the use of a second effici basi on combust and which is call the effici of boiler and furnace55 name effici of boiler and furnace55

almost ident as a matter of fact it is extrem difficult if not imposs to determin the actual effici of a boiler alon as distinguish from the combin effici of boiler grate and furnac this is due to the fact that the loss due to excess air cannot be correct attribut to either the boiler or the furnac but onli to a combin of the complet apparatus attempt have been made to devis method for divid the loss proportion between the furnac and the boiler but such attempt are unsatisfactori and it is imposs to determin the effici of a boiler apart from that of a furnac in such a way as to make such determin of ani practic valu or in a way that might not lead to endless disput were the question to aris in the case of a guarante effici from the boiler manufactur standpoint the onli way of establish an effici that has ani valu when guarante are to be met is to requir the grate or stoker manufactur to make certain guarante as to minimum co {2} maximum co and that the amount of combust in

therebi determin the degre of uniform of evapor 9 qualiti of steam67 if the boiler doe not produc superh steam the percentag of moistur in the steam should be determin by the use of a throttl or separ calorimet if the boiler has superh surfac the temperatur of the steam should be determin by the use of a thermomet insert in a thermomet well for satur steam construct a sampl pipe or nozzl made of one half inch iron pipe and insert it in the steam main at a point where the entrain moistur is like to be most thorough mix the inner end of the pipe which should extend near across to the opposit side of the main should be close and interior portion perfor with not less than twenti one eighth inch hole equal distribut from end to end and prefer drill in irregular or spiral row with the first hole not less than half an inch from the wall of the pipe the sampl pipe should not be place near a point where water may pocket or where such water may effect the amount of moistur contain in the sampl where non return valv are use or there are horizont connect lead from the boiler to a vertic outlet water may collect at the lower end of the uptak pipe and be blown upward in a spray which will not be carri away by the steam owe to a lack of veloc a sampl taken from the lower part of this pipe will show a greater amount of moistur than a true sampl with goos neck connect a small amount of water may collect on the bottom of the pipe near the upper end where the inclin is such that the tendenc to flow backward is ordinarili counterbalanc by the flow of steam forward over it surfac but when the veloc momentarili decreas the water flow back to the lower end of the goos neck and increas the moistur at that point make it an undesir locat for sampl in ani case it must be born in mind that with low veloc the tendenc is for drop of entrain water to settl to the bottom of the pipe and to be temporarili broken up into spray whenev an abrupt bend or other disturb is met if it is necessari to attach the sampl nozzl at a point near the end of a long horizont run a drip pipe should be provid a short distanc in front of the nozzl prefer at a pocket form by some fit and the water run along the bottom of the main drawn off weigh and ad to the moistur shown by the calorimet or better a steam separ should be instal at the point note in test a stationari boiler the sampl pipe should be locat as near as practic to the boiler and the same is true as regard the thermomet well when the steam is superh in an engin or turbin test these locat should be as near as practic to throttl valv in the test of a plant where it is desir to get complet inform especi where the steam main is unusu long sampl nozzl or thermomet well should be provid at both point so as to obtain data

a point beyond which the grate surfac for a given boiler cannot be increas this is due to the impractic of handl grate abov a certain maximum size to the enorm loss in draft pressur through a boiler

presuppos a constant furnac temperatur regardless of the capac at which a given boiler is run to assur equal effici at low and high rate the exit temperatur in the two instanc would necessarili be the same for this temperatur at the high rate to be ident with that at the low rate the rate of heat transfer from the gase to the heat surfac would have to vari direct as the weight or volum of such gase experi has shown howev that this is not true but that this rate of transfer vari as some power of the volum of gas less than one as the heat transfer doe not therefor increas proportion with the volum of gase the exit temperatur for a given furnac temperatur will be increas as the volum of gase increas as this is the measur of the effici of the heat surfac the boiler effici will therefor decreas as the volum of gase increas or the capac at which the boiler is oper increas further a certain portion of the heat absorb by the heat surfac is through direct radiat from the fire again presuppos a constant furnac temperatur the heat absorb through radiat is sole a function of the amount of surfac expos to such radiat henc for the condit assum the amount of heat absorb by radiat at the higher

is proportion larg enough to be a govern factor in the total amount of heat absorb the second reason given abov for a decreas of boiler effici with increas of capac viz the effect of radiant heat is to a greater extent than the first reason depend upon a constant furnac temperatur ani increas in this temperatur will affect enorm the amount of heat absorb by radiat as this absorpt will vari as the fourth power of the temperatur of the radiat bodi in this way it is seen that but a slight increas in furnac temperatur will be necessari to bring the proport part due to absorpt by radiat of the total heat absorb up to it proper proport at the higher rate this factor of furnac temperatur more proper belong to the consider of furnac effici than of boiler effici there is a point howev in ani furnac abov which the combust will be so poor as to actual reduc the furnac temperatur and therefor the proport of heat absorb through radiat by a given amount of expos heat surfac sinc it is thus true that the effici of the boiler consid alon will increas with a decreas capac it is evid that if the furnac condit are constant regardless of the load that the combin effici of boiler and furnac will also decreas with increas load this fact was clear proven in the test of the boiler at the detroit edison company74 the furnac arrang of these boiler and the great care with which the test were run made it possibl to secur uniform good furnac condit irrespect of load and here the maximum effici was obtain at a point somewhat less than the rate capac of the boiler in some case howev and especi in the ordinari oper of the plant the furnac effici will up to a certain point increas with an increas in power this increas in furnac effici is ordinarili at a greater rate as the capac increas than is the decreas in boiler effici with the result that the combin effici of boiler and furnac will to a certain point increas with an increas in capac this make the ordinari point of maximum combin effici somewhat abov the rate capac of the boiler and in mani case the combin effici will be practic a constant over a consider rang of rate the featur limit the establish of the point of maximum effici at a high rate are the same as those limit the amount of grate surfac that can be instal under a boiler the relat effici of differ combin of boiler and furnac at differ rate depend

economi is to be consid that in which against the boiler effici there is to be weigh the plant first cost return on such invest fuel cost labor capac etc etc this matter has been wide discuss but unfortun such discuss has been larg limit to central power station practic the power generat in such station while repres an enorm total is by no mean the larger proport of the total power generat throughout the countri the factor determin the econom load for the small plant howev are the same as in a larg and in general the statement made relat to the question are equal applic the econom rate at which a boiler plant should be run is depend sole upon the load to be carri by that individu plant and the natur of such load the econom load for each individu plant can be determin onli from the care studi of each individu set of condit or by actual trial the control factor in the cost of the plant regardless of the natur of the load is the capac to carri the maximum peak load that may be thrown on the plant under ani condit while load condit do as state vari in everi individu plant in a broad sens all load may be group in three class 1st the approxim constant 24 hour load 2nd the steadi 10 or 12 hour load usual with a noonday period of no load 3rd the 24 hour variabl load found in central station practic the econom load at which the boiler may be run will vari with these group 1st for a constant load 24 hour in the day it will be found in most case that when all featur are consid the most econom load or that at which a given amount of steam can be produc the most cheapli will be consider over the rate hors power of the boiler how much abov the rate capac this most econom load will be is depend larg upon the cost of coal at the plant but under ordinari condit the point of maximum economi will probabl be found to be somewher between 25 and 50 per cent abov the rate capac of the boiler the capit invest must be weigh against the coal save through increas thermal effici and the labor account which increas with the number of unit must be given proper consider when the question is consid in connect with a plant alreadi instal the condit are differ from where a new plant is contempl in an old plant where there are enough boiler to oper at low rate of capac the capit invest lead to a fix charg and it will be found that the most econom load at which boiler may be oper will be lower than where a new plant is under consider 2nd for a load of 10 or 12 hour a day either an approxim steadi load or one in which there is a peak where the boiler have been bank over night the capac at which they may be run with the best economi will be found to be higher than for uniform 24 hour load condit this is obvious due to origin invest that is a given amount of invest capit can be made to earn a larger return through the higher overload and this will hold true to a point where the ad return more than offset the decreas in actual boiler effici here again the determin factor of what is the econom load are the fuel and labor cost balanc against the thermal effici with a load of this charact there is anoth factor which may affect the econom plant oper load this is from the viewpoint of spare boiler that such ad capac in the way of spare is necessari is unquestion sinc they must be instal therefor their presenc lead to a fix charg and it is probabl that for the plant as a whole the econom load will be somewhat lower than if the boiler were consid onli as spare that is it may be found best to oper these spare as a part of the regular equip at all time except when other boiler are off for clean and repair thus reduc the load on the individu boiler and increas the effici under such condit the ad boiler unit can be consid as spare onli dure such time as some of the boiler are not in oper due to the oper difficulti that may be encount at the higher overload it will ordinarili be found that the most econom rate at which to run boiler for such load condit will be between 150 and 175 per cent of rate here again the maximum capac at which the boiler may be run for the best plant economi is limit by the point at which the effici drop below what is warrant in view of the first cost of the apparatus 3rd the 24 hour variabl load this is a class of load carri by the central power station a load constant onli in the sens that there are no period of no load and which vari wide with differ portion of the 24 hour with such a load it is particular difficult to make ani assert as to the point of maximum economi that will hold for ani station as this point is more than with ani other class of load depend upon the factor enter into the oper of each individu plant the method of handl a load of this descript vari probabl more than with ani other kind

capac dure peak by oper the same boiler at high rate in this method there are no boiler kept on bank fire the spare be spare in everi sens of the word a third method of handl wide vari load which is come somewhat into vogu is that of consid the plant as divid one part to take care of what may be consid the constant plant load the other to take care of the float or variabl load with such a method that portion of the plant carri the steadi load is so proport that the boiler may be oper at the point of maximum effici this point be rais to a maximum through the use of econom and the general instal of ani apparatus lead to such result the variabl load will be carri on the remain boiler of the plant under either of the method just given that is at the high rate of all boiler in servic and

natur would obvious not warrant the first cost that a perman plant would if boiler are to carri an intermitt and sudden fluctuat load such as a hoist load or a revers mill load a design would have to

of the apparatus to be use for the condit under which it will oper to the steam consumpt of the main prime mover there is to be ad that of the auxiliari again it is imposs to make a definit statement of what this allow should be the figur depend wholli upon the type and the number of such auxiliari for approxim work it is perhap best to allow 15 or 20 per cent of the steam requir of the main engin

determin of the number and size of boiler unit to be instal this is direct affect by the capac at which a consider of the econom load indic is the best for the oper condit which will exist the other factor enter into such determin are the size of the plant and the charact of the feed water the size of the plant has it bear on the question from the fact that higher effici are in general obtain from larg unit that labor cost decreas with the number of unit the first cost of brickwork is lower for larg than for small size unit a general decreas in the complic of pipe etc and in general the cost per hors power of ani design of boiler decreas with the size of unit to illustr this it is onli necessari to consid a plant of say 10000 boiler hors power consist of 40 250 hors power unit or 17 600 hors power unit the feed water avail has it bear on the subject from the other side for it has alreadi been shown that veri larg unit are not advis where the feed water is not of the best the charact of an instal is also a factor where say 1000 hors power is instal in a plant where it is known what the ultim capac is to be the size of unit should be select with the idea of this ultim capac in mind rather than the amount of the first instal boiler servic from it natur is sever all boiler have to be clean from time to time and certain repair to set etc are a necess this make it necessari in determin the number of boiler to be instal to allow a certain number of unit or spare to be oper when ani of the regular boiler must be taken off the line with the steam requir determin for a plant of moder size and a reason constant load it is high advis to instal at least two spare boiler where a continu of servic is essenti this permit the take off of one boiler for clean or repair and still allow a spare boiler in the event of some unforeseen occurr such as the blow out of a tube or the like invest in such spare apparatus is noth more nor less than insur on the necessari continu of

great extent the life of a boiler set is depend upon the qualiti of the fire brick use and the care exercis in it lay the best fire brick are manufactur from the fire clay of pennsylvania south and west from this local the qualiti of fire clay becom poorer as the distanc increas some of the southern fire clay contain a consider percentag of iron oxid until veri recent the import characterist on which to base a judgment of the suitabl of fire brick for use in connect with boiler set has been consid the melt point or the temperatur at which the brick will liquifi and run experi has shown howev that this point is onli import within certain limit and that the real basi on which to judg materi of this descript is from the boiler man standpoint the qualiti of plastic under a given load this tendenc of a brick to becom plastic occur at a temperatur much below the melt point and to a degre that may caus the brick to becom deform under the stress to which it is subject the allow plastic or soften temperatur will natur be relat and depend upon the stress to be endur with the plastic the determin factor the perfect fire brick is one whose critic point of plastic lie well abov the work temperatur of the fire it is probabl that there are but few brick on the market which would not show if test this critic temperatur at the stress met with in arch construct at a point less than 2400 degre the fact that an arch will stand for a long period under furnac temperatur consider abov this point is due entir to the fact that it temperatur as a whole is far below the furnac temperatur and onli about 10 per cent of it cross section nearest the fire approach the furnac temperatur this is born out by the fact that arch which are heat on both side to the full temperatur of an ordinari furnac will first bow down in the middl and eventu fall a method of test brick for this characterist is given in the technolog paper no 7 of the bureau of standard deal with the test of clay refractori with special refer to their load carri capac at furnac temperatur refer to the test for this specif characterist this public recommend the follow when subject to the load test in a manner substanti as describ in this bulletin at 1350 degre centigrad 2462 degre fahrenheit and under a load of 50 pound per squar inch a standard fire brick test on end should show no serious deform and should not be compress more than one inch refer to the standard length of nine inch in the bureau of standard test for soften temperatur or critic temperatur of plastic under the specifi load the brick are test on end in test fire brick for boiler purpos such a method might be criticis becaus such a test is a compress test and subject to error from unequ bear surfac caus shear furthermor a seri of sampl presum duplic will not fail in the same way due to the mechan variat in the manufactur of the brick arch that fail through plastic show that the tensil strength of the brick is import this be evidenc by the fact that the bottom of a wedg brick in an arch that has fail is usual found to be wider than the top and the adjac brick are firm cement togeth a better method of test is that of test the brick as a beam subject to it own weight and not on end this method has been use for year in germani and is recommend by the highest author in ceram it take into account the failur by tension in the brick as well as by compress and thus cover the tension element which is import in arch construct the plastic point under a unit stress of 100 pound per squar inch which may be taken as the averag maximum arch stress should be abov 2800 degre to give perfect result and should be abov 2400 degre to enabl the brick to be use with ani degre of satisfact the other characterist by which the qualiti of a fire brick is to be judg are fusion point in view of the fact that the critic temperatur of plastic is below the fusion point this is onli import as an indic from high fusion point of a high temperatur of plastic hard this is a relat qualiti base on an arbitrari scale of 10 and is an indic of probabl crack and spall expans the lineal expans per brick in inch this characterist in conjunct with hard is a measur of the physic movement of the brick as affect a mass of brickwork such movement result in crack wall etc the expans will vari between wide limit in differ brick and provid such expans is not in excess of say 05 inch in a 9 inch brick when measur at 2600 degre it is not particular import in a proper design furnac though in general the smaller the expans the better compress the strength necessari to caus crush of the brick at the center of the 41/2 inch face by a steel block one inch squar the compress should ordinarili be low a suggest standard be that a brick

the heavi duti of brick in boiler furnac experi show that arch are the onli part that ordinarili give troubl these fail from the follow caus bad workmanship in lay up of brick this featur is treat below the tendenc of a brick to becom plastic at a temperatur below the fuse point the limit of allow plastic temperatur have alreadi been point out spall this action occur on the inner end of combust arch where they are swept by gase at a high veloc at the full furnac temperatur the most troublesom spall aris through cold air strike the heat brickwork failur from this caus is becom rare due to the larg increas in number of stoker instal in which rapid temperatur chang are to a great degre elimin furthermor there are a number of brick on the market practic free from such defect and where a new brick is consid it can be tri out and if the defect exist can be readili detect and the brick discard failur of arch from the expans power of brick are also rare due to the fact that there are a number of brick in which the expans is well within the allow limit and the eas with which such defect may be determin befor a brick is use failur through chemic disintegr failur through this caus is found onli occasion in brick contain a high percentag of iron oxid with the grade of brick select best suit to the servic of the boiler to be set the other factor affect the life of the set is the lay it is probabl that more set difficulti aris from the improp workmanship in the lay up of brick than from poor materi and to insur a set which will remain tight it is necessari that the masonri work be done most care this is particular true where the boiler is of such a type as to requir combust arch in the furnac red brick should be laid in a thorough mix mortar compos of one volum of portland cement 3 volum of unslack lime and 16 volum of clear sharp sand not less than 21/2 bushel of lime should be use in the lay up of 1000 brick each brick should be thorough embed and all joint fill where red brick and fire brick are both use in the same wall they should be carri up at the same time and thorough bond to each other all fire brick should be dri when use and protect from moistur until use each brick should be dip in a thin fire clay wash rub and shove into place and tap with a wooden mallet until it touch the brick next below it it must be recogn that fire clay is not a cement and that it has littl or no hold power it action is that of a filler rather than a binder and no fire clay wash should be use which has a consist suffici to permit the use of a trowel all fire brick line should be laid up four cours of header and one stretcher furnac center wall should be entir of fire brick if the center of such wall are built of red brick they will melt down and caus the failur of the wall as a whole fire brick arch should be construct of select brick which are smooth straight and uniform the frame on which such arch are built call arch center should be construct of batten

away from the center of the arch rather than toward it when the arch is approxim two third complet a trial ring should be laid to determin whether the key cours will fit when some cut is necessari to secur such a fit it should be done on the two adjac cours on the side of the brick away from the key it is necessari that the key cours be a true fit from top to bottom and after it has been dip and driven it should not extend below the surfac of the arch but prefer should have it lower ledg one quarter inch abov this surfac after fit the key should be dip replac loos and the whole cours driven uniform into place by mean of a heavi hammer and a piec of wood extend the full length of the key cours such a drive in of this cours should rais the arch as a whole from the center the center should

properti in addit to the densiti are introduc in the form of coeffici from a consider of the physic dimens of the various unit and of the theoret formula that are suppos to govern the flow of the gas and the transfer of heat all assum that the correct method of repres the heat transfer rate is by the use of one term which seem to be unwarr and probabl has been adopt on account of the conveni in work up the result by plot them logarithm this was the method professor reynold use in determin his equat for the loss in head in fluid flow through cylindr pipe and it is now known that the deriv equat cannot be consid as anyth more than an empir formula it therefor is well for anyon consid this subject to understand at the outset that the formula discuss are onli of an empir natur and applic to limit rang of temperatur under the condit approxim the same as those surround the experi from which the constant of the formula were determin it is not probabl that the subject of heat transfer in boiler will ever be on ani other than an experiment basi until the mathemat express connect the quantiti of fluid which will flow through a channel of ani section under a given head has been found and some explan of it deriv obtain take the simplest possibl section name a circl it is found that at low veloc the loss of head is direct proport to the veloc and the fluid flow in straight stream line or the motion is direct this motion is in exact accord with the theoret equat of the motion of a viscous fluid and constitut almost a direct proof that the fundament assumpt on which these equat are base are correct when howev the veloc exceed a valu which is determin for ani size of tube the direct or stream line motion break down and is replac by an eddi or mix flow in this flow the head loss by friction is approxim although not exact proport to the squar of the veloc no explan of this has ever been found in spite of the fact that the subject has been treat by the best mathematician and physicist for year back it is to be assum that the heat transfer dure the mix flow would be at a much higher rate than with the direct or stream line flow and professor croker and clement86 have demonstr that this is true the increas in the transfer be so mark as to enabl them to determin the point of critic veloc from observ the rise in temperatur of water flow through a tube surround by a steam jacket the formula given appli onli to a mix flow and inasmuch as from what has just been state this form of motion doe not exist from zero veloc upward it follow that ani express for the heat transfer rate that would make it valu zero when the veloc is zero can hard be correct below the critic veloc the transfer rate seem to be littl affect by chang in veloc and nusselt87 in anoth paper which mathemat treat the direct or stream line flow conclud that while it is approxim constant as far as the veloc is concern in a straight cylindr tube it would vari from point to point of the tube grow less as the surfac pass over increas it should further be note that no account in ani of this experiment work has been taken of radiat of heat from the gas sinc the common gase absorb veri littl radiant heat at ordinari temperatur it has been assum that they radiat veri littl at ani temperatur this may or may not be true but certain a visibl flame must radiat as well as absorb heat howev this radiat may occur sinc it would be a volum phenomenon rather than a surfac phenomenon it would be consid somewhat differ from ordinari radiat it might appli as increas the conduct of the gas which howev independ of radiat is known to increas with the temperatur it is therefor to be expect that at high temperatur the rate of transfer will be greater than at low temperatur the experiment determin of transfer rate at high temperatur are lack although compar noth is known concern the heat radiat from gase at high temperatur there is no question but what a larg proport of the heat absorb by a boiler is receiv direct as radiat from the furnac experi show that the lower row of tube of a babcock and wilcox boiler absorb heat at an averag rate per squar foot of surfac between the first baffl and the front header equival to the evapor of from 50 to 75 pound of water from and at 212 degre fahrenheit per hour inasmuch as in these experi no separ could be made between the heat absorb by the bottom of the tube and that absorb by the top the averag includ both maximum and minimum rate for those particular tube and it is fair to assum that the portion of the tube actual expos to the furnac radiat absorb heat at a higher rate part of this heat was of cours absorb by actual contact between the hot gase and the boiler heat surfac a larg portion of it howev must have been due to radiat whether this radiant heat came from the fire surfac and the brickwork and pass through the gase in the furnac with littl or no absorpt or whether on the other hand the radiat were absorb by the furnac gase and the heat receiv by the boiler was a secondari radiat from the gase themselv and at a rate correspond to the actual gas temperatur is a question if the radiat are direct then the term furnac temperatur as usual use has no scientif mean for obvious the temperatur of the gas in the furnac would be entir differ from the radiat temperatur even were it possibl to attach ani signific to the term radiat temperatur and it is not possibl to do this unless the radiat are what are known as full radiat from a so call black bodi if furnac radiat take place in this manner the indic of a pyromet place in a furnac are hard to interpret and such temperatur measur can be of littl valu if the furnac gase absorb the radiat from the fire and from the brickwork of the side wall and in their turn radiat heat to the boiler surfac it is scientif correct to assum that the actual or sensibl temperatur of the gas would be measur by a pyromet and the amount of radiat could be calcul from this temperatur by stefan law which is to the effect that the rate of radiat is proport to the fourth power of the absolut temperatur use the constant with the result formula that has been determin from direct experi and other phenomena with this understand of the matter the radiat absorb by a boiler can be taken as equal to that absorb by a flat surfac cover the portion of the boiler tube expos to the furnac and at the temperatur of the tube surfac when complet expos on one side to the radiat from an atmospher at the temperatur in the furnac with this assumpt if s{1} is the area of the surfac t the absolut temperatur of the furnac gase t the absolut temperatur of the tube surfac of the boiler the heat absorb per hour measur in b t us is equal to / t \ / t \ 1600 {4} {4} s{1} \1000/ \1000/ in use this formula or in ani work connect with heat transfer the extern temperatur of the boiler heat surfac can be taken as that of satur steam at the pressur under which the boiler is work with an almost neglig error sinc experi have shown that with a surfac clean intern the extern surfac is onli a few degre hotter than the water in contact with the inner surfac even at the highest rate of evapor further than this it is not conceiv that in a modern boiler there can be much differ in the temperatur of the boiler in the differ part or much differ between the temperatur of the water and the temperatur of the steam in the drum which is in contact with it if the total evapor of a boiler measur in b t us per hour is repres by e the furnac temperatur by t {1} the temperatur of the gas leav the boiler by t {2} the weight of gas leav the furnac and pass through the set per hour by w the specif heat of the gas by c it follow from the fact that the total amount of heat absorb is equal to the heat receiv from radiat plus the heat remov from the gase by cool from the temperatur t {1} to the temperatur t {2} that / t \ / t \ e = 1600 {4} {4} s{1} + wct {1} t {2} \1000/ \1000/ this formula can be use for calcul the furnac temperatur when e t and t {2} are known but it must be rememb that an assumpt which is probabl in part at least incorrect is impli in use it or in use ani similar formula express in this way howev it seem more ration than the one propos a few year ago by dr nicholson88 where in place of the surfac expos to radiat he use the grate surfac and assum the furnac gas temperatur as equal to the fire temperatur if the heat transfer rate is taken as independ of the gas temperatur and the heat absorb by an element of the surfac in a given time is equat to the heat given out from the gas pass over this surfac in the same time a singl integr give rs t t = t {1} t e{ } wc where s is the area of surfac pass over by the gase from the furnac to ani point where the gas temperatur t is measur and the rate of heat transfer is r as written this formula could be use for calcul the temperatur of the gas at ani point in the boiler set gas temperatur howev calcul in this way are not to be depend upon as it is known that the transfer rate is not independ of the temperatur again if the transfer rate is assum as vari direct with the weight of the gase pass which is reynold suggest it is seen that the weight of the gase entir disappear from the formula and as a consequ if the formula was correct as long as the temperatur of the gas enter the surfac from the furnac was the same the temperatur throughout the set would be the same this is known also to be incorrect if howev in place of t is written t {2} and in place of s is written s the entir surfac of the boiler and the formula is re arrang it becom wc t {1} t r = log89 s t {2} t this formula can be consid as give a way of calcul an averag transfer rate it has been use in this way for calcul the averag transfer rate from boiler test in which the capac has vari from an evapor of a littl over 3 pound per squar foot of surfac up to 15 pound when plot against the gas weight it was found that the point were almost exact on a line this line howev did not pass through the zero point but start at a point correspond to approxim a transfer rate of 2 check out against mani other test the straight line law seem to hold general and this is true even though materi chang are made in the method of calcul the furnac temperatur the inclin of the line howev vari invers as the averag area for the passag of the gas through the boiler if a is the averag area between all the pass of the boiler the heat transfer rate in babcock and wilcox type boiler with ordinari clean surfac can be determin to a rather close approxim from the formula w r = 200 + 0014 a the manner in which a appear in this formula is the same as it would appear in ani formula in which the heat transfer rate was taken as depend upon the product of the veloc and the densiti of the gas joint sinc this product as point out abov is equival to w/a nusselt experi as well as those of other indic that the ratio appear in the proper way while the under principl from which the formula for this averag transfer rate was determin are question and at best onli approxim correct it nevertheless follow that assum the transfer rate as determin experiment the formula can be use in an invers way for calcul the amount of surfac requir in a boiler for cool the gase through a rang of temperatur cover by the experi and it has been found that the result bear out this assumpt the practic applic of the theori of heat transfer as develop at present seem consequ to rest on these last two formula which from their natur are more or less empir through the rang in the product of steam met with in boiler now in servic which in the marin type extend to the averag evapor of 12 to 15 pound of water from and at 212 degre fahrenheit per squar foot of surfac the constant 2 in the approxim formula for the averag heat transfer rate constitut quit a larg proport of the total the compar increas in the transfer rate due to a chang in weight of the gase is not as great consequ as it would be if this constant were zero for this reason with the same temperatur of the gase enter the boiler surfac there will be a gradual increas in the temperatur of the gase leav the surfac as the veloc or weight of flow increas and the proport of the heat contain in the gase enter the boiler which is absorb by it is gradual reduc it is of cours possibl that the weight of the gase could be increas to such an amount or the area for their passag through the boiler reduc by addit baffl until the constant term in the heat transfer formula would be relat unimport under such condit as point out previous the final gas temperatur would be unaffect by a further increas in the veloc of the flow and the fraction of the heat carri by the gase remov by the boiler would be constant actual test of wast heat boiler in which the weight of gas per squar foot of section area for it passag is mani time more than in ordinari instal show howev that this condit has not been attain and it will probabl never be attain in ani practic instal it is for this reason that the conclus of dr nicholson in the paper refer to and of messr kreising and ray in the pamphlet the transmiss of heat into steam boiler publish by the depart of the interior in 1912 are not applic without modif to boiler design in superheat the heat transfer is effect in two differ stage the first transfer is from the hot gas to the metal of the superheat tube and the second transfer is from the metal of the tube to the steam on the insid there is theoret an intermedi stage in the transfer of the heat from the outsid to the insid surfac of the tube the conduct of steel is suffici howev to keep the temperatur of the two side of the tube veri near equal to each other so that the effect of the transfer in the tube itself can be neglect the transfer from the hot gas to the metal of the tube take place in the same way as with the boiler tube proper regard be paid to the temperatur of the tube which increas as the steam is heat the transfer from the insid surfac of the tube to the steam is the invers of the process of the transfer of the heat on the outsid and seem to follow the same law the transfer rate therefor will increas with the veloc of the steam through the tube for this reason intern core are quit often use in superheat and actual result in an increas in the amount of superheat obtain from a given surfac the averag transfer rate in superheat base on a differ in mean temperatur between the gas on the outsid of the tube and the steam on the insid of the tube is if r is the transfer rate from the gas to the tube and r the rate from the tube to the steam rr r + r and is alway less than either r or r this rate is usual greater than the averag transfer rate for the boiler as comput in the way outlin in the preced paragraph sinc howev steam cannot under ani imagin set of condit take up more heat from a tube than would water at the same averag temperatur this fact support the content made that the actual transfer rate in a boiler must increas quit rapid with the temperatur the actual transfer rate in superheat are affect by so mani condit
