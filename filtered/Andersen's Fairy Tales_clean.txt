his inclin he had late been iii the watchman adventur whi there is a pair of galosh as sure as im aliv said the watchman awak from a gentl slumber they belong no doubt to the lieuten who live over the way they lie close to the door the worthi man was inclin to ring and deliv them at the hous for there was still a light in the window but he did not like disturb the other peopl in their bed and so veri consider he left the matter alon such a pair of shoe must be veri warm and comfort said he the leather is so soft and suppl they fit his feet as though they had been made for him tis a curious world we live in continu he soliloqu there is the lieuten now who might go quiet to bed if he chose where no doubt he could stretch himself at his eas but doe he do it no he saunter up and down his room becaus probabl he has enjoy too mani of the good thing of this world at his dinner that a happi fellow he has neither an infirm mother nor a whole troop of everlast hungri children to torment him everi even he goe to a parti where his nice supper cost him noth would to heaven i could but chang with him how happi should i be while express his wish the charm of the shoe which he had put on began to work the watchman enter into the be and natur of the lieuten he stood in the handsom furnish apart and held between his finger a small sheet of rose color paper on which some vers were writtenwritten inde by the offic himself for who has not at least onc in his life had a lyric moment and if one then mark down one thought poetri is produc but here was written oh were i rich oh were i rich such was my wish yea such when hard three feet high i long for much oh were i rich an offic were i with sword and uniform and plume so high and the time came and offic was i but yet i grew not rich ala poor me have piti thou who all man want dost see i sat one even sunk in dream of bliss a maid of seven year old gave me a kiss i at that time was rich in poesi and tale of old though poor as poor could be but all she ask for was this poesi then was i rich but not in gold poor me as thou dost know who all men heart canst see oh were i rich oft ask i for this boon the child grew up to womanhood full soon she is so pretti clever and so kind oh did she know what hidden in my mind a tale of old would she to me were kind but im condemn to silenc oh poor me as thou dost know who all men heart canst see oh were i rich in calm and peac of mind my grief you then would not here written find o thou to whom i do my heart devot oh read this page of glad day now remot a dark dark tale which i tonight devot dark is the futur now ala poor me have piti thou who all men pain dost see such vers as these peopl write when they are in love but no man in his sens ever think of print them here one of the sorrow of life in which there is real poetri gave itself vent not that barren grief which the poet may onli hint at but never depict in it detailmiseri and want that anim necess in short to snatch at least at a fallen leaf of the bread fruit tree if not at the fruit itself the higher the posit in which one find oneself transplant the greater is the suffer everyday necess is the stagnant pool of lifeno love pictur reflect itself therein lieuten love and lack of moneythat is a symbol triangl or much the same as the half of the shatter die of fortun this the lieuten felt most poignant and this was the reason he leant his head against the window and sigh so deepli the poor watchman out there in the street is far happier than i he know not what i term privat he has a home a wife and children who weep with him over his sorrow who rejoic with him when he is glad oh far happier were i could i exchang with him my beingwith his desir and with his hope perform the weari pilgrimag of life oh he is a hundr time happier than i in the same moment the watchman was again watchman it was the shoe that caus the metamorphosi by mean of which unknown to himself he took upon him the thought and feel of the offic but as we have just seen he felt himself in his new situat much less content and now prefer the veri thing which but some minut befor he had reject so then the watchman was again watchman that was an unpleas dream said he but twas droll enough altogeth i fanci that i was the lieuten over there and yet the thing was not veri much to my tast after all i miss my good old mother and the dear littl one who almost tear me to piec for sheer love he seat himself onc more and nod the dream continu to haunt him for he still had the shoe on his feet a fall star shone in the dark firmament there fall anoth star said he but what doe it matter there are alway enough left i should not much mind examin the littl glimmer thing somewhat nearer especi the moon for that would not slip so easili through a man finger when we dieso at least say the student for whom my wife doe the washingw shall fli about as light as a feather from one such a star to the other that of cours not true but twould be pretti enough if it were so if i could but onc take a leap up there my bodi might stay here on the step for what i care beholdther are certain thing in the world to which one ought never to give utter except with the greatest caution but doubli care must one be when we have the shoe of fortun on our feet now just listen to what happen to the watchman as to ourselv we all know the speed produc by the employ of steam we have experienc it either on railroad or in boat when cross the sea but such a flight is like the travel of a sloth in comparison with the veloc with which light move it fli nineteen million time faster than the best race hors and yet electr is quicker still death is an electr shock which our heart receiv the freed soul soar upward on the wing of electr the sun light want eight minut and some second to perform a journey of more than twenti million of our danish mile born by electr the soul want even some minut less to accomplish the same flight to it the space between the heaven bodi is not greater than the distanc between the home of our friend in town is for us even if they live a short way from each other such an electr shock in the heart howev cost us the use of the bodi here below unless like the watchman of east street we happen to have on the shoe of fortun a danish mile is near 4 3/4 english in a few second the watchman had done the fifti two thousand of our mile up to the moon which as everyon know was form out of matter much lighter than our earth and is so we should say as soft as newli fallen snow he found himself on one of the mani circumjac mountain ridg with which we are acquaint by mean of dr madler map of the moon within down it sunk perpendicular into a caldron about a danish mile in depth while below lay a town whose appear we can in some measur realiz to ourselv by beat the white of an egg in a glass of water the matter of which it was built was just as soft and form similar tower and dome and pillar transpar and rock in the thin air while abov his head our earth was roll like a larg fieri ball he perceiv immedi a quantiti of be who were certain what we call men yet they look differ to us a far more correct imagin than that of the pseudo herschel had creat them and if they had been place in rank and file and copi by some skil painter hand one would without doubt have exclaim involuntarili what a beauti arabesqu this relat to a book publish some year ago in germani and said to be by herschel which contain a descript of the moon and it inhabit written with such a semblanc of truth that mani were deceiv by the impostur probabl a translat of the celebr moon hoax written by richard a lock and origin publish in new york they had a languag too but sure nobodi can expect that the soul of the watchman should understand it be that as it may it did comprehend it for in our soul there germin far greater power than we poor mortal despit all our clever have ani notion of doe she not show ussh the queen in the land of enchantmenth astound dramat talent in all our dream there everi acquaint appear and speak upon the stage so entir in charact and with the same tone of voic that none of us when awak were abl to imit it how well can she recal person to our mind of whom we have not thought for year when sudden they step forth everi inch a man resembl the real personag even to the finest featur and becom the hero or heroin of our world of dream in realiti such remembr are rather unpleas everi sin everi evil thought may like a clock with alarm or chime be repeat at pleasur then the question is if we can trust ourselv to give an account of everi unbecom word in our heart and on our lip the watchman spirit understood the languag of the inhabit of the moon pretti well the selenit disput various about our earth and express their doubt if it could be inhabit the air they said must certain be too dens to allow ani ration dweller in the moon the necessari free respir they consid the moon alon to be inhabit they imagin it was the real heart of the univers or planetari system on which the genuin cosmopolit or citizen of the world dwelt what strang thing menno what strang thing selenit sometim take into their head dweller in the moon about polit they had a good deal to say but littl denmark must take care what it is about and not run counter to the moon that great realm that might in an ill humor bestir itself and dash down a hail storm in our face or forc the baltic to overflow the side of it gigant basin we will therefor not listen to what was spoken and on no condit run in the possibl of tell tale out of school but we will rather proceed like good quiet citizen to east street and observ what happen meanwhil to the bodi of the watchman he sat lifeless on the step the morn star that is to say the heavi wooden staff head with iron spike and which had noth els in common with it sparkl brother in the sky had glide from his hand while his eye were fix with glassi stare on the moon look for the good old fellow of a spirit which still haunt it the watchmen in germani had former and in some place they still carri with them on their round at night a sort of mace or club known in ancient time by the abov denomin what the hour watchman ask a passer by but when the watchman gave no repli the merri royster who was now return home from a noisi drink bout took it into his head to tri what a tweak of the nose would do on which the suppos sleeper lost his balanc the bodi lay motionless stretch out on the pavement the man was dead when the patrol came up all his comrad who comprehend noth of the whole affair were seiz with a dread fright for dead he was and he remain so the proper author were inform of the circumst peopl talk a good deal about it and in the morn the bodi was carri to the hospit now that would be a veri pretti joke if the spirit when it came back and look for the bodi in east street were not to find one no doubt it would in it anxieti run off to the polic and then to the hue and cri offic to announc that the finder will be handsom reward and at last away to the hospit yet we may bold assert that the soul is shrewdest when it shake off everi fetter and everi sort of lead stringth bodi onli make it stupid the seem dead bodi of the watchman wander as we have said to the hospit where it was brought into the general view room and the first thing that was done here was natur to pull off the galosheswhen the spirit that was mere gone out on adventur must have return with the quick of lightn to it earth tenement it took it direct toward the bodi in a straight line and a few second after life began to show itself in the man he assert that the preced night had been the worst that ever the malic of fate had allot him he would not for two silver mark again go through what he had endur while moon stricken but now howev it was over the same day he was discharg from the hospit as perfect cure but the shoe meanwhil remain behind iv a moment of head importancean even dramat readingsa most strang journey everi inhabit of copenhagen know from person inspect how the entranc to frederick hospit look but as it is possibl that other who are not copenhagen peopl may also read this littl work we will beforehand give a short descript of it the extens build is separ from the street by a pretti high rail the thick iron bar of which are so far apart that in all serious it is said some veri thin fellow had of a night occasion squeez himself through to go and pay his littl visit in the town the part of the bodi most difficult to manag on such occas was no doubt the head here as is so often the case in the world long head peopl get through best so much then for the introduct one of the young men whose head in a physic sens onli might be said to be of the thickest had the watch that even the rain pour down in torrent yet despit these two obstacl the young man was oblig to go out if it were but for a quarter of an hour and as to tell the door keeper about it that he thought was quit unnecessari if with a whole skin he were abl to slip through the rail there on the floor lay the galosh which the watchman had forgotten he never dream for a moment that they were those of fortun and they promis to do him good servic in the wet so he put them on the question now was if he could squeez himself through the grate for he had never tri befor well there he stood would to heaven i had got my head through said he involuntarili and instant through it slip easili and without pain notwithstand it was pretti larg and thick but now the rest of the bodi was to be got through ah i am much too stout groan he aloud while fix as in a vice i had thought the head was the most difficult part of the matteroh oh i realli cannot squeez myself through he now want to pull his over hasti head back again but he could not for his neck there was room enough but for noth more his first feel was of anger his next that his temper fell to zero the shoe of fortun had place him in the most dread situat and unfortun it never occur to him to wish himself free the pitch black cloud pour down their content in still heavier torrent not a creatur was to be seen in the street to reach up to the bell was what he did not like to cri aloud for help would have avail him littl besid how asham would he have been to be found caught in a trap like an outwit fox how was he to twist himself through he saw clear that it was his irrevoc destini to remain a prison till dawn or perhap even late in the morn then the smith must be fetch to file away the bar but all that would not be done so quick as he could think about it the whole chariti school just opposit would be in motion all the new booth with their not veri courtier like swarm of seamen would join them out of curios and would greet him with a wild hurrah while he was stand in his pillori there would be a mob a hiss and rejoic and jeer ten time wors than in the row about the jew some year agooh my blood is mount to my brain tis enough to drive one mad i shall go wild i know not what to do oh were i but loos my dizzi would then ceas oh were my head but loos you see he ought to have said that sooner for the moment he express the wish his head was free and cure of all his paroxysm of love he hasten off to his room where the pain consequ on the fright the shoe had prepar for him did not so soon take their leav but you must not think that the affair is over now it grow much wors the night pass the next day also but nobodi came to fetch the shoe in the even dramat read were to be given at the littl theatr in king street the hous was fill to suffoc and among other piec to be recit was a new poem by h c andersen call my aunt spectacl the content of which were pretti near as follow a certain person had an aunt who boast of particular skill in fortun tell with card and who was constant be storm by person that want to have a peep into futur but she was full of mysteri about her art in which a certain pair of magic spectacl did her essenti servic her nephew a merri boy who was his aunt darl beg so long for these spectacl that at last she lent him the treasur after have inform him with mani exhort that in order to execut the interest trick he need onli repair to some place where a great mani person were assembl and then from a higher posit whenc he could overlook the crowd pass the compani in review befor him through his spectacl immedi the inner man of each individu would be display befor him like a game of card in which he uner might read what the futur of everi person present was to be well pleas the littl magician hasten away to prove the power of the spectacl in the theatr no place seem to him more fit for such a trial he beg permiss of the worthi audienc and set his spectacl on his nose a motley phantasmagoria present itself befor him which he describ in a few satir touch yet without express his opinion open he tell the peopl enough to set them all think and guess but in order to hurt nobodi he wrap his witti oracular judgment in a transpar veil or rather in a lurid thundercloud shoot forth bright spark of wit that they may fall in the powder magazin of the expect audienc the humor poem was admir recit and the speaker much applaud among the audienc was the young man of the hospit who seem to have forgotten his adventur of the preced night he had on the shoe for as yet no law owner had appear to claim them and besid it was so veri dirti out of door they were just the thing for him he thought the begin of the poem he prais with great generos he even found the idea origin and effect but that the end of it like the rhine was veri insignific prove in his opinion the author want of invent he was without genius etc this was an excel opportun to have said someth clever meanwhil he was haunt by the ideah should like to possess such a pair of spectacl himself then perhap by use them circumspect one would be abl to look into peopl heart which he thought would be far more interest than mere to see what was to happen next year for that we should all know in proper time but the other never i can now said he to himself fanci the whole row of ladi and gentlemen sit there in the front row if one could but see into their heartsy that would be a revelationa sort of bazar in that ladi yonder so strang dress i should find for certain a larg millin shop in that one the shop is empti but it want clean plain enough but there would also be some good state shop among them ala sigh he i know one in which all is state but there sit alreadi a spruce young shopman which is the onli thing that amiss in the whole shop all would be splendid deck out and we should hear walk in gentlemen pray walk in here you will find all you pleas to want ah i wish to heaven i could walk in and take a trip right through the heart of those present and behold to the shoe of fortun this was the cue the whole man shrunk togeth and a most uncommon journey through the heart of the front row of spectat now began the first heart through which he came was that of a middl age ladi but he instant fanci himself in the room of the institut for the cure of the crook and deform where cast of mis shapen limb are display in nake realiti on the wall yet there was this differ in the institut the cast were taken at the entri of the patient but here they were retain and guard in the heart while the sound person went away they were name cast of femal friend whose bodili or mental deform were here most faith preserv with the snake like writh of an idea he glide into anoth femal heart but this seem to him like a larg holi fane the white dove of innoc flutter over the altar how glad would he have sunk upon his knee but he must away to the next heart yet he still heard the peal tone of the organ and he himself seem to have becom a newer and a better man he felt unworthi to tread the neighbor sanctuari which a poor garret with a sick bed rid mother reveal but god warm sun stream through the open window love rose nod from the wooden flower box on the roof and two sky blue bird sang rejoic while the sick mother implor god richest bless on her pious daughter templ he now crept on hand and feet through a butcher shop at least on everi side and abov and below there was nought but flesh it was the heart of a most respect rich man whose name is certain to be found in the directori he was now in the heart of the wife of this worthi gentleman it was an old dilapid moulder dovecot the husband portrait was use as a weather cock which was connect in some way or other with the door and so they open and shut of their own accord whenev the stern old husband turn round hereupon he wander into a boudoir form entir of mirror like the one in castl rosenburg but here the glass magnifi to an astonish degre on the floor in the middl of the room sat like a dalai lama the insignific self of the person quit confound at his own great he then imagin he had got into a needl case full of point needl of everi size this is certain the heart of an old maid thought he but he was mistaken it was the heart of a young militari man a man as peopl said of talent and feel in the greatest perplex he now came out of the last heart in the row he was unabl to put his thought in order and fanci that his too live imagin had run away with him good heaven sigh he i have sure a disposit to madnessti dread hot here my blood boil in my vein and my head is burn like a coal and he now rememb the import event of the even befor how his head had got jam in between the iron rail of the hospit that what it is no doubt said he i must do someth in time under such circumst a russian bath might do me good i onli wish i were alreadi on the upper bank in these russian vapor bath the person extend himself on a bank or form and as he get accustom to the heat move to anoth higher up toward the ceil where of cours the vapor is warmest in this manner he ascend gradual to the highest and so there he lay on the uppermost bank in the vapor bath but with all his cloth on in his boot and galosh while the hot drop fell scald from the ceil on his face holloa cri he leap down the bath attend on his side utter a loud cri of astonish when he beheld in the bath a man complet dress the other howev retain suffici presenc of mind to whisper to him tis a bet and i have won it but the first thing he did as soon as he got home was to have a larg blister put on his chest and back to draw out his mad the next morn he had a sore chest and a bleed back and except the fright that was all that he had gain by the shoe of fortun v metamorphosi of the copi clerk the watchman whom we have certain not forgotten thought meanwhil of the galosh he had found and taken with him to the hospit he now went to fetch them and as neither the lieuten nor anybodi els in the street claim them as his properti they were deliv over to the polic offic as on the contin in all law and polic practic noth is verbal but ani circumst howev trifl is reduc to write the labor as well as the number of paper that thus accumul is enorm in a polic offic consequ we find copi clerk among mani other scribe of various denomin of which it seem our hero was one whi i declar the shoe look just like my own said one of the clerk eye the newli found treasur whose hidden power even he sharp as he was was not abl to discov one must have more than the eye of a shoemak to know one pair from the other said he soliloqu and put at the same time the galosh in search of an owner besid his own in the corner here sir said one of the men who pant brought him a tremend pile of paper the copi clerk turn round and spoke awhil with the man about the report and legal document in question but when he had finish and his eye fell again on the shoe he was unabl to say whether those to the left or those to the right belong to him at all event it must be those which are wet thought he but this time in spite of his clever he guess quit wrong for it was just those of fortun which play as it were into his hand or rather on his feet and whi i should like to know are the polic never to be wrong so he put them on quick stuck his paper in his pocket and took besid a few under his arm intend to look them through at home to make the necessari note it was noon and the weather that had threaten rain began to clear up while gaili dress holiday folk fill the street a littl trip to fredericksburg would do me no great harm thought he for i poor beast of burden that i am have so much to annoy me that i dont know what a good appetit is tis a bitter crust ala at which i am condemn to gnaw nobodi could be more steadi or quiet than this young man we therefor wish him joy of the excurs with all our heart and it will certain be benefici for a person who lead so sedentari a life in the park he met a friend one of our young poet who told him that the follow day he should set out on his long intend tour so you are go away again said the clerk you are a veri free and happi be we other are chain by the leg and held fast to our desk yes but it is a chain friend which ensur you the bless bread of exist answer the poet you need feel no care for the come morrow when you are old you receiv a pension true said the clerk shrug his shoulder and yet you are the better off to sit at one eas and poetisethat is a pleasur everybodi has someth agreeabl to say to you and you are alway your own master no friend you should but tri what it is to sit from one year end to the other occupi with and judg the most trivial matter the poet shook his head the copi clerk did the same each one kept to his own opinion and so they separ it a strang race those poet said the clerk who was veri fond of soliloqu i should like some day just for a trial to take such natur upon me and be a poet myself i am veri sure i should make no such miser vers as the other today methink is a most delici day for a poet natur seem anew to celebr her awaken into life the air is so unusu clear the cloud sail on so buoyant and from the green herbag a fragranc is exhal that fill me with delight for mani a year have i not felt as at this moment we see alreadi by the forego effus that he is becom a poet to give further proof of it howev would in most case be insipid for it is a most foolish notion to fanci a poet differ from other men among the latter there may be far more poetic natur than mani an acknowledg poet when examin more close could boast of the differ onli is that the poet possess a better mental memori on which account he is abl to retain the feel and the thought till they can be embodi by mean of word a faculti which the other do not possess but the transit from a commonplac natur to one that is rich endow demand alway a more or less breakneck leap over a certain abyss which yawn threaten below and thus must the sudden chang with the clerk strike the reader the sweet air continu he of the polic offic in his dreami imagin how it remind me of the violet in the garden of my aunt magdalena yes then i was a littl wild boy who did not go to school veri regular o heaven tis a long time sinc i have thought on those time the good old soul she live behind the exchang she alway had a few twig or green shoot in waterlet the winter rage without as it might the violet exhal their sweet breath whilst i press against the windowpan cover with fantast frost work the copper coin i had heat on the stove and so made peep hole what splendid vista were then open to my view what changewhat magnific yonder in the canal lay the ship frozen up and desert by their whole crew with a scream crow for the sole occup but when the spring with a gentl stir motion announc her arriv a new and busi life aros with song and hurrah the ice was sawn asund the ship were fresh tar and rig that they might sail away to distant land but i have remain heremust alway remain here sit at my desk in the offic and patient see other peopl fetch their passport to go abroad such is my fate alassigh he and was again silent great heaven what is come to me never have i thought or felt like this befor it must be the summer air that affect me with feel almost as disquiet as they are refresh he felt in his pocket for the paper these polic report will soon stem the torrent of my idea and effectu hinder ani rebelli overflow of the time worn bank of offici duti he said to himself consol while his eye ran over the first page dame tigbrith tragedi in five act what is that and yet it is undeni my own handwrit have i written the tragedi wonder veri wonderfuland thiswhat have i here intrigu on the rampart or the day of repent vaudevill with new song to the most favorit air the deuc where did i get all this rubbish some one must have slip it slyli into my pocket for a joke there is too a letter to me a crumpl letter and the seal broken yes it was not a veri polit epistl from the manag of a theatr in which both piec were flat refus hem hem said the clerk breathless and quit exhaust he seat himself on a bank his thought were so elast his heart so tender and involuntarili he pick one of the nearest flower it is a simpl daisi just burst out of the bud what the botanist tell us after a number of imperfect lectur the flower proclaim in a minut it relat the mythus of it birth told of the power of the sun light that spread out it delic leav and forc them to impregn the air with their incenseand then he thought of the manifold struggl of life which in like manner awaken the bud flower of feel in our bosom light and air contend with chivalr emul for the love of the fair flower that bestow her chief favor on the latter full of long she turn toward the light and as soon as it vanish roll her tender leav togeth and slept in the embrac of the air it is the light which adorn me said the flower but tis the air which enabl thee to breath said the poet voic close by stood a boy who dash his stick into a wet ditch the drop of water splash up to the green leafi roof and the clerk thought of the million of ephemera which in a singl drop were thrown up to a height that was as great doubtless for their size as for us if we were to be hurl abov the cloud while he thought of this and of the whole metamorphosi he had undergon he smile and said i sleep and dream but it is wonder how one can dream so natur and know besid so exact that it is but a dream if onli to morrow on awak i could again call all to mind so vivid i seem in unusu good spirit my percept of thing is clear i feel as light and cheer as though i were in heaven but i know for a certainti that if to morrow a dim remembr of it should swim befor my mind it will then seem noth but stupid nonsens as i have often experienc alreadyespeci befor i enlist under the banner of the polic for that dispel like a whirlwind all the vision of an unfett imagin all we hear or say in a dream that is fair and beauti is like the gold of the subterranean spirit it is rich and splendid when it is given us but view by daylight we find onli wither leav ala he sigh quit sorrow and gaze at the chirp bird that hop content from branch to branch they are much better off than i to fli must be a heaven art and happi do i prize that creatur in which it is innat yes could i exchang my natur with ani other creatur i fain would be such a happi littl lark he had hard utter these hasti word when the skirt and sleev of his coat fold themselv togeth into wing the cloth becam feather and the galosh claw he observ it perfect and laugh in his heart now then there is no doubt that i am dream but i never befor was awar of such mad freak as these and up he flew into the green roof and sang but in the song there was no poetri for the spirit of the poet was gone the shoe as is the case with anybodi who doe what he has to do proper could onli attend to one thing at a time he want to be a poet and he was one he now wish to be a merri chirp bird but when he was metamorphos into one the former peculiar ceas immedi it is realli pleasant enough said he the whole day long i sit in the offic amid the driest law paper and at night i fli in my dream as a lark in the garden of fredericksburg one might realli write a veri pretti comedi upon it he now flutter down into the grass turn his head grace on everi side and with his bill peck the pliant blade of grass which in comparison to his present size seem as majest as the palm branch of northern africa unfortun the pleasur last but a moment present black night overshadow our enthusiast who had so entir miss his part of copi clerk at a polic offic some vast object seem to be thrown over him it was a larg oil skin cap which a sailor boy of the quay had thrown over the struggl bird a coars hand sought it way care in under the broad rim and seiz the clerk over the back and wing in the first moment of fear he call inde as loud as he couldyou impud littl blackguard i am a copi clerk at the polic offic and you know you cannot insult ani belong to the constabulari forc without a chastis besid you good for noth rascal it is strict forbidden to catch bird in the royal garden of fredericksburg but your blue uniform betray where you come from this fine tirad sound howev to the ungod sailor boy like a mere pippi pi he gave the noisi bird a knock on his beak and walk on he was soon met by two schoolboy of the upper classthat is to say as individu for with regard to learn they were in the lowest class in the school and they bought the stupid bird so the copi clerk came to copenhagen as guest or rather as prison in a famili live in gother street tis well that im dream said the clerk or i realli should get angri first i was a poet now sold for a few penc as a lark no doubt it was that accurs poetic natur which has metamorphos me into such a poor harmless littl creatur it is realli pitiabl particular when one get into the hand of a littl blackguard perfect in all sort of cruelti to anim all i should like to know is how the stori will end the two schoolboy the proprietor now of the transform clerk carri him into an eleg room a stout state dame receiv them with a smile but she express much dissatisfact that a common field bird as she call the lark should appear in such high societi for to day howev she would allow it and they must shut him in the

of his life howev that was over nowth tree gone the stori at an end all all was overeveri tale must end at last the snow queen first stori which treat of a mirror and of the splinter now then let us begin when we are at the end of the stori we shall know more than we know now but to begin onc upon a time there was a wick sprite inde he was the most mischiev of all sprite one day he was in a veri good humor for he had made a mirror with the power of caus all that was good and beauti when it was reflect therein to look poor and mean but that which was good for noth and look ugli was shown magnifi and increas in ugli in this mirror the most beauti landscap look like boil spinach and the best person were turn into fright or appear to stand on their head their face were so distort that they were not to be recognis and if anyon had a mole you might be sure that it would be magnifi and spread over both nose and mouth that glorious fun said the sprite if a good thought pass through a man mind then a grin was seen in the mirror and the sprite laugh heartili at his clever discoveri all the littl sprite who went to his schoolfor he kept a sprite schooltold each other that a miracl had happen and that now onli as they thought it would be possibl to see how the world realli look they ran about with the mirror and at last there was not a land or a person who was not repres distort in the mirror so then they thought they would fli up to the sky and have a joke there the higher they flew with the mirror the more terribl it grin they could hard hold it fast higher and higher still they flew nearer and nearer to the star when sudden the mirror shook so terribl with grin that it flew out of their hand and fell to the earth where it was dash in a hundr million and more piec and now it work much more evil than befor for some of these piec were hard so larg as a grain of sand and they flew about in the wide world and when they got into peopl eye there they stay and then peopl saw everyth pervert or onli had an eye for that which was evil this happen becaus the veri smallest bit had the same power which the whole mirror had possess some person even got a splinter in their heart and then it made one shudder for their heart becam like a lump of ice some of the broken piec were so larg that they were use for windowpan through which one could not see one friend other piec were put in spectacl and that was a sad affair when peopl put on their glass to see well and right then the wick sprite laugh till he almost choke for all this tickl his fanci the fine splinter still flew about in the air and now we shall hear what happen next second stori a littl boy and a littl girl in a larg town where there are so mani hous and so mani peopl that there is no roof left for

of the youngest soon grew tire and both return to town two littl girl sat down and twine garland so they did not go either and when the other reach the willow tree where the confection was they said now we are there in realiti the bell doe not exist it is onli a fanci that peopl have taken into their head at the same moment the bell sound deep in the wood so clear and solemn that five or six determin to penetr somewhat further it was so thick and the foliag so dens that it was quit fatigu to proceed woodroof and anemoni grew almost too high bloom convolvulus and blackberri bush hung in

befor the garden there was a larg iron rail with an iron door it look quit splendid and peopl stood still and peep in and the sparrow hung by score in the vine and chatter away at each other as well

it is delight not to be forgotten delight shout someth close by but no one except the pewter soldier saw that it was a piec of the hog leather hang it had lost all it gild it look like a piec of wet clay but it had an opinion and it gave it the gild decay but hog leather stay this the pewter soldier did not believ the happi famili realli the largest green leaf in this countri is a dock leaf if one hold it befor one it is like a whole apron and if one hold it over one head in raini weather it is almost as good as an umbrella for it is so immens larg the burdock never grow alon but where there grow one there alway grow sever it is a great delight and all this delight is snail food the great white snail which person of qualiti in former time made fricasse of ate and said hem hem how delici for they thought it tast so delicateliv on dock leav and therefor burdock seed were sown now there was an old manor hous where they no longer ate snail they were quit extinct but the burdock were not extinct they grew and grew all over the walk and all the bed they could not get the masteri over themit was a whole forest of burdock here and there stood an appl and a plum tree or els one never would have thought that it was a garden all was burdock and there live the two last vener old snail they themselv knew not how old they were but they could rememb veri well that there had been mani more that they were of a famili from foreign land and that for them and their the whole forest was plant they had never been outsid it but they knew that there was still someth more in the world which was call the manor hous and that there they were boil and then they becam black and were then place on a silver dish but what happen further they knew not or in fact what it was to be boil and to lie on a silver dish they could not possibl imagin but it was said to be delight and particular genteel neither the chafer the toad nor the earth worm whom they ask about it could give them ani informationnon of them had been boil or laid on a silver dish the old white snail were the first person of distinct in the world that they knew the forest was plant for their sake and the manor hous was there that they might be boil and laid on a silver dish now they live a veri lone and happi life and as they had no children themselv they had adopt a littl common snail which they brought up as their own but the littl one would not grow for he was of a common famili but the old one especi dame mother snail thought they could observ how he increas in size and she beg father if he could not see it that he would at least feel the littl snail shell and then he felt it and found the good dame was right one day there was a heavi storm of rain hear how it beat like a drum on the dock leav said father snail there are also rain drop said mother snail and now the rain pour right down the stalk you will see that it will be wet here i am veri happi to think that we have our good hous and the littl one has his also there is more done for us than for all other creatur sure enough but can you not see that we are folk of qualiti in the world we are provid with a hous from our birth and the burdock forest is plant for our sake i should like to know how far it extend and what there is outsid there is noth at all said father snail no place can be better than our and i have noth to wish for yes said the dame i would will go to the manorhous be boil and laid on a silver dish all our forefath have been treat so there is someth extraordinari in it you may be sure the manor hous has most like fallen to ruin said father snail or the burdock have grown up over it so that they cannot come out there need not howev be ani hast about that but you are alway in such a tremend hurri and the littl one is begin to be the same has he not been creep up that stalk these three day it give me a headach when i look up to him you must not scold him said mother snail he creep so care he will afford us much pleasureand we have noth but him to live for but have you not thought of it where shall we get a wife for him do you not think that there are some of our speci at a great distanc in the interior of the burdock forest black snail i dare say there are enough of said the old one black snail without a housebut they are so common and so conceit but we might give the ant a commiss to look out for us they run to and fro as if they had someth to do and they certain know of a wife for our littl snail i know one sure enoughth most charm one said one of the ant but i am afraid we shall hard succeed for she is a queen that is noth said the old folk has she a hous she has a palac said the ant the finest ant palac with seven hundr passag i thank you said mother snail our son shall not go into an ant hill if you know noth better than that we shall give the commiss to the white gnat they fli far and wide in rain and sunshin they know the whole forest here both within and without we have a wife for him said the gnat at a hundr human pace from here there sit a littl snail in her hous on a gooseberri bush she is quit lone and old enough to be marri it is onli a hundr human pace well then let her come to him said the old one he has a whole forest of burdock she has onli a bush and so they went and fetch littl miss snail it was a whole week befor she arriv but therein was just the veri best of it for one could thus see that she was of the same speci and then the marriag was celebr six earth worm shone as well as they could in other respect the whole went off veri quiet for the old folk could not bear nois and merriment but old dame snail made a brilliant speech father snail could not speak he was too much affect and so they gave them as a dowri and inherit the whole forest of burdock and saidwhat they had alway saidthat it was the best in the world and if they live honest and decent and increas and multipli they and their children would onc in the cours of time come to the manor hous be boil black and laid on silver dish after this speech was made the old one crept into their shell and never more came out they slept the young coupl govern in the forest and had a numer progeni but they were never boil and never came on the silver dish so from this they conclud that the manor hous had fallen to ruin and that all the men in the world were extinct and as no one contradict them so of cours it was so and the rain beat on the dock leav to make drum music for their sake and the sun shone in order to give the burdock forest a color for their sake and they were veri happi and the whole famili was happi for they inde were so the stori of a mother a mother sat there with her littl child she was so downcast so afraid that it should die it was so pale the small eye had close themselv and it drew it breath so soft now and then with a deep respir as if it sigh and the mother look still more sorrow on the littl creatur then a knock was heard at the door and in came a poor old man wrap up as in a larg hors cloth for it warm one and he need it as it was the cold winter season everyth out of door was cover with ice and snow and the wind blew so that it cut the face as the old man trembl with cold and the littl child slept a moment the mother went and pour some ale into a pot and set it on the stove that it might be warm for him the old man sat and rock the

with thi littl child he goe faster than the wind and he never bring back what he take oh onli tell me which way he went said the mother tell me the way and i shall find him i know it said the woman in

there the door opposit was also open late in the even but it was dark within at least in the front room further in there was heard the sound of music the learn foreign thought it quit marvel but nowit might be that he onli imagin itfor he found everyth marvel out there in the warm land if there had onli been no sun the stranger landlord said that he didnt know who had taken the hous opposit one saw

he cannot master it howev long he play the word mahogani can be understood in danish as have two mean in general it mean the reddish brown wood itself but in jest it signifi excess fine which aros from an anecdot of nybod in copenhagen the seamen quarter a sailor wife who was alway proud and fine in her way came to her neighbor and complain that she had got a splinter in her finger what of ask the neighbor wife it is a mahogani splinter said the other mahogani it cannot be less with you exclaim the womanand thenc the proverb it is so mahoganythat is so excess finei deriv one night the stranger awokeh slept with the door of the balconi openth curtain befor it was rais by the wind and he thought that a strang lustr came from the opposit neighbor hous all the flower shone like flame in the most beauti color and in the midst of the flower stood a slender grace maidenit was as if she also shone the light realli hurt his eye he now open them quit widey he was quit awak with one spring he was on the floor he crept gentl behind the curtain but the maiden was gone the flower shone no longer but there they stood fresh and bloom as ever the door was ajar and far within the music sound so soft and delight one could realli melt away in sweet thought from it yet it was like a piec of enchant and who live there where was the actual entranc the whole of the ground floor was a row of shop and there peopl could not alway be run through one even the stranger sat out on the balconi the light burnt in the room behind him and thus it was quit natur that his shadow should fall on his opposit neighbor wall yes there it sat direct opposit between the flower on the balconi and when the stranger move the shadow also move for that it alway doe i think my shadow is the onli live thing one see over there said the learn man see how nice it sit between the flower the door stand half open now the shadow should be cun and go into the room look about and then come and tell me what it had

rose and his shadow on the opposit neighbor balconi rose also the stranger turn round and the shadow also turn round yes if anyon had paid particular attent to it they would have seen quit distinct that the shadow went in through the half open balconi door of their opposit neighbor just as the stranger went into his own room and let the long curtain fall down after him next morn the learn man went out to drink coffe and read the newspap what is that said he as he came out into the sunshin i have no shadow so then it has actual gone last night and not come again it is realli tiresom this annoy him not so much becaus the shadow was gone but becaus he knew there was a stori about a man without a shadow it was known to everybodi at home in the cold land and if the learn man now came there and told his stori they would say that he was imit it and that he had no need to do he would therefor not talk about it at all and that was wise thought peter schlemihl the shadowless man in the even he went out again on the balconi he had place the light direct behind him for he knew that the shadow would alway have it master for a screen but he could not entic it he made himself littl he made himself great but no shadow came again he said hem hem but it was of no use it was vexati but in the warm land everyth grow so quick and after the laps of eight day he observ to his great joy that a new shadow came in the sunshin in the cours of three week he had a veri fair shadow which when he set out for his home in the northern land grew more and more in the journey so that at last it was so long and so larg that it was more than suffici the learn man then came home and he wrote book about what was true in the world and about what was good and what was beauti and there pass day and

and in winter wear veri larg wooden shoe which made her littl instep quit red and that look so danger in the middl of the villag live old dame shoemak she sat and sew togeth as well as she could a littl pair of shoe out of old red strip of cloth they were veri clumsi but it was a kind thought they were meant for the littl girl the littl girl was call karen on the veri day her mother was buri karen receiv the red shoe and wore them for the first time they were certain not intend for mourn but she had no other and with stockingless feet she follow the poor straw coffin in them sudden a larg old carriag drove up and a larg old ladi sat in it she look at the littl girl felt compass for her and then said to the clergyman here give me the littl girl i will adopt her and karen believ all this happen on account of the red shoe but the old ladi thought they were horribl and they were burnt but karen herself was clean and nice dress she must learn to read and sew and peopl said she was a nice littl thing but the look glass said thou art more than nice thou art beauti now the queen onc travel through the land and she had her littl daughter with her and this littl daughter was a princess and peopl stream to the castl and karen was there also and the littl princess stood in her fine white dress in a window and let herself be stare at she had neither a train nor a golden crown but splendid red morocco shoe they were certain far handsom than those dame shoemak had made for littl karen noth in the world can be compar with red shoe now karen was old enough to be confirm she had new cloth and was to have new shoe also the rich shoemak in the citi took the measur of her littl foot this took place at his hous in his room where stood larg glass case fill with eleg shoe and brilliant boot all this look charm but the old ladi could not see well and so had no pleasur in them in the midst of the shoe stood a pair of red one just like those the princess had worn how beauti they were the shoemak said also they had been made for the child of a count but had not fit that must be patent leather said the old ladi they shine so yes they shine said karen and they fit and were bought but the old ladi knew noth about their be red els she would never have allow karen to have gone in red shoe to be confirm yet such was the case everybodi look at her feet and when she step through the chancel door on the church pavement it seem to her as if the old figur on the tomb those portrait of old preacher and preacher wive with stiff ruff and long black dress fix their eye on her red shoe and she thought onli of them as the clergyman laid his hand upon her head and spoke of the holi baptism of the coven with god and how she should be now a matur christian and the organ peal so solemn the sweet children voic sang and the old music director sang but karen onli thought of her red shoe in the afternoon the old ladi heard from everyon that the shoe had been red and she said that it was veri wrong of karen that it was not at all becom and that in futur karen should onli go in black shoe to church even when she should be older the next sunday there was the sacrament and karen look at the black shoe look at the red oneslook at them again and put on the red shoe the sun shone glorious karen and the old ladi walk along the path through the corn it was rather dusti there at the church door stood an old soldier with a crutch and with a wonder long beard which was more red than white and he bow to the ground and ask the old ladi whether he might dust her shoe and karen stretch out her littl foot see what beauti danc shoe said the soldier sit firm when you danc and he put his hand out toward the sole and the old ladi gave the old soldier alm and went into the church with karen and all the peopl in the church look at karen red shoe and all the pictur and as karen knelt befor the altar and rais the cup to her lip she onli thought of the red shoe and they seem to swim in it and she forgot to sing her psalm and she forgot to pray our father in heaven now all the peopl went out of church and the old ladi got into her carriag karen rais her foot to get in after her when the old soldier said look what beauti danc shoe and karen could not help danc a step or two and when she began her feet continu to danc it was just as though the shoe had power over them she danc round the church corner she could not leav off the coachman was oblig to run after and catch hold of her and he lift her in the carriag but her feet continu to danc so that she trod on the old ladi dread at length she took the shoe off and then her leg had peac the shoe were place in a closet at home but karen could not avoid look at them now the old ladi was sick and it was said she could not recov she must be nurs and wait upon and there was no one whose duti it was so much as karen but there was a great ball in the citi to which karen was invit she look at the old ladi who could not recov she look at the red shoe and she thought there could be no sin in it she put on the red shoe she might do that also she thought but then she went to the ball and began to danc when she want to danc to the right the shoe would danc to the left and when she want to danc up the room the shoe danc back again down the step into the street and out of the citi gate she danc and was forc to danc straight out into the gloomi wood then it was sudden light up among the tree and she fanci it must be the moon for there was a face but it was the old soldier with the red beard he sat there nod his head and said look what beauti danc shoe then she was terrifi and want to fling off the red shoe but they clung fast and she pull down her stock but the shoe seem to have grown to her feet and she danc and must danc over field and meadow in rain and sunshin by night and day but at night it was the most fear she danc over the churchyard but the dead did not dancethey had someth better to do than to danc she wish to seat herself on a poor man grave where the bitter tansi grew but for her there was neither peac nor rest and when she danc toward the open church door she saw an angel stand there he wore long white garment he had wing which reach from his shoulder to the earth his counten was sever and grave and in his hand he held a sword broad and glitter danc shalt thou said he danc in thi red shoe till thou art pale and cold till thi skin shrivel up and thou art a skeleton danc shalt thou from door to door and where proud vain children dwell thou shalt knock that they may hear thee and trembl danc shalt thou merci cri karen but she did not hear the angel repli for the shoe carri her through the gate into the field across road and bridg and she must keep ever danc one morn she danc past a door which she well knew within sound a psalm a coffin deck with flower was born forth then she knew that the old ladi was dead and felt that she was abandon by all and condemn by the angel of god she danc and she was forc to danc through the gloomi night the shoe carri her over stack and stone she was torn till she bled she danc over the heath till she came to a littl hous here she knew dwelt the execution and she tap with her finger at the window and said come out come out i cannot come in for i am forc to danc and the execution said thou dost not know who i am i fanci i strike bad peopl head off and i hear that my axe ring dont strike my head off said karen then i cant repent of my sin but strike off my feet in the red shoe and then she confess her entir sin and the execution struck off her feet with the red shoe but the shoe danc away with the littl feet across the field into the deep wood and he carv out littl wooden feet for her and crutch taught her the psalm crimin alway sing and she kiss the hand which had wield the axe and went over the heath now i have suffer enough for the red shoe said she now i will go into the church that peopl may see me and she hasten toward the

hear the word of god but she went alon into her littl chamber there was onli room for a bed and chair to stand in it and here she sat down with her prayer book and whilst she read with a pious mind the wind bore the strain of the organ toward her and she rais her tear counten and said o god help me and the sun shone so clear and straight befor her stood the angel of god in white garment the same she had seen that night at the church door but he no longer carri the sharp sword but in it stead a splendid green spray full of rose and he touch the ceil with the spray and the ceil rose so high and
