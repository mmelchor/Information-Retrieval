southern el peten guatemala at that time the ohio oil compani of guatemala had an air strip and camp at chinaja from which place the compani was construct a road northward through the forest in mid februari 1960 j knox jone jr and i flew into el peten to collect and studi mammal reptil and amphibian while enjoy the comfort of the fine field camp at chinaja we work in the surround forest and avail ourselv of the opportun to be on hand when the road crew were cut the tall tree in the forest therebi bring to the ground mani interest specimen of the arbor fauna we stay at chinaja until late march with the except of a week spent at toocog anoth camp of the ohio oil compani locat 15 kilomet southeast of la libertad and on the edg of the savanna thus at toocog we were abl to work both in the forest and on the savanna in the summer of 1960 john wellman accompani me to el peten for two week in june and juli most of our time was spent at chinaja but a few day were spent at toocog and other local in south central el peten mani area in guatemala have been studi intens by l c stuart who has publish on the herpetofauna of the forest area of northeastern el peten 1958 the savanna of central el peten 1935 and the humid mountain region to the south of el peten in alta verapaz 1948 and 1950 the area studi by me and my companion is cover with rainforest and lie to the north of the highland of alta verapaz and to the south of the savanna of central el peten a few specimen of amphibian and reptil were obtain in this area in 1935 by c l hubb and henri van der schali this collect report on by stuart 1937 contain onli one speci cochranella fleischmanni not present in our collect of 77 speci and 617 specimen acknowledg i am grate to l c stuart of the univers of michigan who made the initi arrang for our work in el peten aid me in the identif of certain specimen and help in the prepar of this report j knox jone jr and john wellman were abl field companion who ad great to the number of specimen in the collect in guatemala clark m shimeal and harold hoopman of the ohio oil compani of guatemala made avail to us the facil of the compani camp at chinaja and toocog alberto alcain and lui escal welcom us at chinaja and gave us everi possibl assist juan montera and antonio aldana made our stay at toocog enjoy and profit dure our visit to southern el peten julio bolon c work for us as a collector and between march and june he collect and save mani valuabl specimen his knowledg of the forest and it inhabit was a great asset to our work jorg a ibarra director of the museo nacion de historia natur in guatemala assist us in obtain necessari permit and extend other kind to all of these peopl i am indebt for the essenti part that they play in the complet of this studi field work in the winter of 1960 was made possibl by fund from the american heart associ for the purpos of collect mammalian heart my field work in the summer of 1960 was support by a grant from the graduat research fund of the univers of kansa descript of the area a vast lowland region stretch northward for approxim 700 kilomet from the highland of guatemala to the gulf of mexico the northern two third of this low plain is border on three side by sea and form the yucatan peninsula the lowland at the base of the yucatan peninsula make up the departamento el peten of guatemala the area with which this report is concern consist of the south central part of el peten physiographi immedi south of chinaja is a rang of hill the serrania de chinaja have an almost due east west axi and a crest of about 600 meter abov sea level south of the serrania de chinaja are succeed higher ridg build up to the meseta de coban and sierra de pocolha and eventu to the main guatemalan highland the northern face of the serrania de chinaja is a fault scarp drop abrupt from about 650 meter at the crest to about 140 meter at the base from the base of the serrania de chinaja northward to the rio de la pasion at sayaxch the terrain is gentl roll and has a total relief of about 50 meter north of the rio de la pasion is a low dome reach an elev of 170 meter at la libertad see stuart 193512 for further discuss of the physiographi of central el peten the rock in southern el peten are predomin miocen marin limeston there are occasion pocket of pliocen deposit there is littl evid of subterranean solut at chinaja but northward in central el peten karst is common the upper few inch of soil is humus rich in organ matter below this is clay climat the climat of el peten is tropic with equabl temperatur throughout the year temperatur at chinaja vari between a night time low of 65deg f and a daytim high of 91deg f dure the time of our visit in the koppen system of classif the climat at chinaja and toocog is af rain fall throughout the year but there is a notic dri season to anyon who has travel from south to north in el peten and the yucatan peninsula it is obvious from the chang in veget that there is a decreas in rainfal from south to north there is a notic differ between chinaja and toocog although rainfal data are not avail for chinaja and toocog there are record for nearbi station sapper 1932 at paso caballo on the rio san pedro about 40 kilomet northwest of toocog the averag annual rainfal amount to 1620 mm the driest month is march 21 mm and the wettest month

there are 28 29 vomerin teeth more than twice as mani as in specimen from finca volcan stuart 194317 but notic fewer than in the specimen from chinaja the presenc of this speci at chinaja lend support to the idea that the specimen from the rio de la pasion list by brocchi 1882116 also is bolitoglossa dofleini furthermor the confirm presenc of this speci in the lowland of el peten suggest that there may be genet connect between b dofleini in the alta verapaz and b yucatana in the yucatan peninsula bolitoglossa yucatana differ from b dofleini in have five intercost space between adpress toe and in

eleutherodactylus anzuetoi from alta verapaz and el quich guatemala suggest that the new speci was an upland relat of eleutherodactylus rostrali werner and use that name for the frog that he earlier had refer to eleutherodactylus rhodopi dunn and emlen 193224 place e rostrali in the synonymi of e gollmeri peter examin of seri of these frog from southern mexico guatemala and costa rica caus me to think that there are four speci these can be distinguish as follow e rhodopi no web between toe one tarsal tubercl tibiotars articul reach to nostril iri bronz in life e anzuetoi no web between toe a row of tarsal tubercl tibiotars articul reach to tip of snout color of iri unknown e rostrali a vestig of web between toe no tarsal tubercl tibiotars articul reach snout or slight beyond iri copperi red in life e gollmeri a vestig of web between toe no tarsal tubercl tibiotars articul reach well beyond snout iri copperi red in life the presenc of web between the toe the absenc of tarsal tubercl and the copperi red iri distinguish e rostrali and e gollmeri from the other speci probabl e rostrali and e gollmeri are conspecif but addit specimen are need from nicaragua and hondura to prove conspecif on the other hand the charact of the frog from chinaja clear show that they are relat to e gollmeri to the south and not to e rhodopi to the north in mexico at chinaja eleutherodactylus
