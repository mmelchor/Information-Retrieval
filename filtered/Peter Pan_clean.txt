their coracl simpl boat we too have been there we can still hear the sound of the surf though we shall land no more of all delect island the neverland is the snuggest and most compact not larg and sprawli you know with tedious distanc between one adventur and anoth but nice cram when you play at it by day with the chair and tabl cloth it is not in the least alarm but in the two minut befor you go to sleep it becom veri real that is whi there are night light occasion in her travel through her children mind mrs darl found thing she could not understand and of these quit the most perplex was the word peter she knew of no peter and yet he was here and there in john and michael mind while wendi began to be scrawl all over with him the name stood out in bolder letter than ani of the other word and as mrs darl gaze she felt that it had an odd cocki appear yes he is rather cocki wendi admit with regret her mother had been question her but who is he my pet he is peter pan you know mother at first mrs darl did not know but after think back into her childhood she just rememb a peter pan who was said to live with the fairi there were odd stori about him as that when children die he went part of the way with them so that they should not be frighten she had believ in him at the time but now that she was marri and full of sens she quit doubt whether there was ani such person besid she said to wendi he would be grown up by this time oh no he isnt grown up wendi assur her confid and he is just my size she meant that he was her size in both mind and bodi she didnt know how she knew she just knew it mrs darl consult mr darl but he smile pooh pooh mark my word he said it is some nonsens nana has been put into their head just the sort of idea a dog would have leav it alon and it will blow over but it would not blow over and soon the troublesom boy gave mrs darl quit a shock children have the strangest adventur without be troubl by them for instanc they may rememb to mention a week after the event happen that when they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game with him it was in this casual way that wendi one morn made a disquiet revel some leav of a tree had been found on the nurseri floor which certain were not there when the children went to bed and mrs darl was puzzl over them when wendi said with a toler smile i do believ it is that peter again whatev do you mean wendi it is so naughti of him not to wipe his feet wendi said sigh she was a tidi child she explain in quit a matter of fact way that she thought peter sometim came to the nurseri in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and play on his pipe to her unfortun she never woke so she didnt know how she knew she just knew what nonsens you talk precious no one can get into the hous without knock i think he come in by the window she said my love it is three floor up were not the leav at the foot of the window mother it was quit true the leav had been found veri near the window mrs darl did not know what to think for it all seem so natur to wendi that you could not dismiss it by say she had been dream my child the mother cri whi did you not tell me of this befor i forgot said wendi light she was in a hurri to get her breakfast oh sure she must have been dream but on the other hand there were the leav mrs darl examin them veri care they were skeleton leav but she was sure they did not come from ani tree that grew in england she crawl about the floor peer at it with a candl for mark of a strang foot she rattl the poker up the chimney and tap the wall she let down a tape from the window to the pavement and it was a sheer drop of thirti feet without so much as a spout to climb up by certain wendi had been dream but wendi had not been dream as the veri next night show the night on which the extraordinari adventur of these children may be said to have begun on the night we speak of all the children were onc more in bed it happen to be nana even off and mrs darl had bath them and sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of sleep all were look so safe and cosi that she smile at her fear now and sat down tranquilli by the fire to sew it was someth for michael who on his birthday was get into shirt the fire was warm howev and the nurseri dim lit by three night light and present the sew lay on mrs darl lap then her head nod oh so grace she was asleep look at the four of them wendi and michael over there john here and mrs darl by the fire there should have been a fourth night light while she slept she had a dream she dreamt that the neverland had come too near and that a strang boy had broken through from it he did not alarm her for she thought she had seen him befor in the face of mani women who have no children perhap he is to be found in the face of some mother also but in her dream he had rent the film that obscur the neverland and she saw wendi and john and michael peep through the gap the dream by itself would have been a trifl but while she was dream the window of the nurseri blew open and a boy did drop on the floor he was accompani by a strang light no bigger than your fist which dart about the room like a live thing and i think it must have been this light that waken mrs darl she start up with a cri and saw the boy and somehow she knew at onc that he was peter pan if you or i or wendi had been there we should have seen that he was veri like mrs darl kiss he was a love boy clad in skeleton leav and the juic that ooz out of tree but the most entranc thing about him was that he had all his first teeth when he saw she was a grown up he gnash the littl pearl at her chapter 2 the shadow mrs darl scream and as if in answer to a bell the door open and nana enter return from her even out she growl and sprang at the boy who leapt light through the window again mrs darl scream this time in distress for him for she thought he was kill and she ran down into the street to look for his littl bodi but it was not there and she look up and in the black night she could see noth but what she thought was a shoot star she return to the nurseri and found nana with someth in her mouth which prove to be the boy shadow as he leapt at the window nana had close it quick too late to catch him but his shadow had not had time to get out slam went the window and snap it off you may be sure mrs darl examin the shadow care but it was quit the ordinari kind nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow she hung it out at the window mean he is sure to come back for it let us put it where he can get it easili without disturb the children but unfortun mrs darl could not leav it hang out at the window it look so like the wash and lower the whole tone of the hous she thought of show it to mr darl but he was tot up winter great coat for john and michael with a wet towel around his head to keep his brain clear and it seem a shame to troubl him

and nana see that no help would come from her strain and strain at the chain until at last she broke it in anoth moment she had burst into the dine room of 27 and flung up her paw to heaven her most express way of make a communic mr and mrs darl knew at onc that someth terribl was happen in their nurseri and without a good bye to their hostess they rush into the street but it was now ten minut sinc three scoundrel had been breath behind the curtain and peter pan can do a great deal in ten minut we now return to the nurseri it all right john announc emerg from his hide place i say peter can

been trifl with them for no one can fli unless the fairi dust has been blown on him fortun as we have mention one of his hand was messi with it and he blew some on each of them with the most superb result now just wiggl your shoulder this way he said and let go they were all on their bed and gallant michael let go first he did not quit mean to let go but he did it and immedi he was born across the room i flew he scream while still in mid air john let go and met wendi near the bathroom oh love oh rip look at me look at me look at me they were not near so eleg as peter they could not help kick a littl but their head were bob against the ceil and there is almost noth so delici as that peter gave wendi a hand at first but had to desist tink was so indign up and down they went and round and round heaven was wendi word i say cri john whi shouldnt we all go out of cours it was to this that peter had been lure them michael was readi he want to see how long it took him to do a billion mile but wendi hesit mermaid said peter again oo and there are pirat pirat cri john seiz his sunday hat let us go at onc it was just at this moment that mr and mrs darl hurri with nana out of 27 they ran into the middl of the street to look up at the nurseri window and yes it was still shut but the room was ablaz with light and most heart grip sight of all they could see in shadow on the curtain three littl figur in night attir circl round and round not on the floor but in the air not three figur four in a trembl they open the street door mr darl would have rush upstair but mrs darl sign him to go soft she even tri to make her heart go soft will they reach the nurseri in time if so how delight for them and we shall all breath a sigh of relief but there will be no stori on the other hand if they are not in time i solemn promis that it will all come right in the end they would have reach the nurseri in time had it not been that the littl star were watch them onc again the star blew the window open and that smallest star of all call out cave peter then peter knew that there was not a moment to lose come he cri imperi and soar out at onc into the night follow by john and michael and wendi mr and mrs darl and nana rush into the nurseri too late the bird were flown chapter 4 the flight second to the right and straight on till morn that peter had told wendi was the way to the neverland but even bird carri map and consult them at windi corner could not have sight it with these instruct peter you see just said anyth that came into his head at first his companion trust him implicit and so great were the delight of fli that they wast time circl round church spire or ani other tall object on the way that took their fanci john and michael race michael get a start they recal with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselv fine fellow for be abl to fli round a room not long ago but how long ago they were fli over the sea befor this thought began to disturb wendi serious john thought it was their second sea and their third night sometim it was dark and sometim light and now they were veri cold and again too warm did they realli feel hungri at time or were they mere pretend becaus peter had such a jolli new way of feed them his way was to pursu bird who had food in their mouth suitabl for human and snatch it from them then the bird would follow and snatch it back and they would all go chase each other gaili for mile part at last with mutual express of good will but wendi notic with gentl concern that peter did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of get your bread and butter nor even that there are other way certain they did not pretend to be sleepi they were sleepi and that was a danger for the moment they pop off down they fell the aw thing was that peter thought this funni there he goe again he would cri gleefulli as michael sudden drop like a stone save him save him cri wendi look with horror at the cruel sea far below eventu peter would dive through the air and catch michael just befor he could strike the sea and it was love the way he did it but he alway wait till the last moment and you felt it was his clever that interest him and not the save of human life also he was fond of varieti and the sport that engross him one moment would sudden ceas to engag him so there was alway the possibl that the next time you fell he would let you go he could sleep in the air without fall by mere lie on his back and float but this was part at least becaus he was so light that if you got behind him and blew he went faster do be more polit to him wendi whisper to john when they were play follow my leader then tell him to stop show off said john when play follow my leader peter would fli close to the water and touch each shark tail in pass just as in the street you may run your finger along an iron rail they could not follow him in this with much success so perhap it was rather like show off especi as he kept look behind to see how mani tail they miss you must be nice to him wendi impress on her brother what could we do if he were to leav us we could go back michael said how could we ever find our way back without him well then we could go on said john that is the aw thing john we should have to go on for we dont know how to stop this was true peter had forgotten to show them how to stop john said that if the worst came to the worst all they had to do was to go straight on for the world was round and so in time they must come back to their own window and who is to get food for us john i nip a bit out of that eagl mouth pretti neat wendi after the twentieth tri wendi remind him and even though we becam good at pick up food see how we bump against cloud and thing if he is not near to give us a hand inde they were constant bump they could now fli strong though they still kick far too much but if they saw a cloud in front of them the more they tri to avoid it the more certain did they bump into it if nana had been with them she would have had a bandag round michael forehead by this time peter was not with them for the moment and they felt rather lone up there by themselv he could go so much faster than they that he would sudden shoot out of sight to have some adventur in which they had no share he would come down laugh over someth fear funni he had been say to a star but he had alreadi forgotten what it was or he would come up with mermaid scale still stick to him and yet not be abl to say for certain what had been happen it was realli rather irrit to children who had never seen a mermaid and if he forget them so quick wendi argu how can we expect that he will go on rememb us inde sometim when he return he did not rememb them at least not well wendi was sure of it she saw recognit come into his eye as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on onc even she had to call him by name im wendi she said agit he was veri sorri i say wendi he whisper to her alway if you see me forget you just keep on say im wendi and then ill rememb of cours this was rather unsatisfactori howev to make amend he show them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was go their way and this was such a pleasant chang that they tri it sever time and found that they could sleep thus with secur inde they would have slept longer but peter tire quick of sleep and soon he would cri in his captain voic we get off here so with occasion tiff but on the whole rollick they drew near the neverland for after mani moon they did reach it and what is more they had been go pretti straight all the time not perhap so much owe to the guidanc of peter or tink as becaus the island was look for them it is onli thus that ani one may sight those magic shore there it is said peter calm where where where all the arrow are point inde a million golden arrow were point it out to the children all direct by their friend the sun who want them to be sure of their way befor leav them for the night wendi and john and michael stood on tip toe in the air to get their first sight of the island strang to say they all recogn it at onc and until fear fell upon them they hail it not as someth long dreamt of and seen at last but as a familiar friend to whom they were return home for the holiday john there the lagoon wendi look at the turtl buri their egg in the sand i say john i see your flamingo with the broken leg look michael there your cave john what that in the brushwood it a wolf with her whelp wendi i do believ that your littl whelp there my boat john with her side stove in no it isnt whi we burn your boat that her at ani rate i say john i see the smoke of the redskin camp where show me and ill tell you by the way smoke curl whether they are on the war path there just across the mysteri river i see now yes they are on the war path right enough peter was a littl annoy with them for know so much but if he want to lord it over them his triumph was at hand for have i not told you that anon fear fell upon them it came as the arrow went leav the island in gloom in the old day at home the neverland had alway begun to look a littl dark and threaten by bedtim then unexplor patch aros in it and spread black shadow move about in them the roar of the beast of prey was quit differ now and abov all you lost the certainti that you would win you were quit glad that the night light were on you even like nana to say that this was just the mantelpiec over here and that the neverland was all make believ of cours the neverland had been make believ in those day but it was real now and there were no night light and it was get darker everi moment and where was nana they had been fli apart but they huddl close to peter now his careless manner had gone at last his eye were sparkl and a tingl went through them everi time they touch his bodi they were now over the fearsom island fli so low that sometim a tree graze their feet noth horrid was visibl in the air yet their progress had becom slow and labour exact as if they were push their way through hostil forc sometim they hung in the air until peter had beaten on it with his fist they dont want us to land he explain who are they wendi whisper shudder but he could not or would not say tinker bell had been asleep on his shoulder but now he waken her and sent her on in front sometim he pois himself in the air listen intent with his hand to his ear and again he would stare down with eye so bright that they seem to bore two hole to earth have done these thing he went on again his courag was almost appal would you like an adventur now he said casual to john or would you like to have your tea first wendi said tea first quick and michael press her hand in gratitud but the braver john hesit what kind of adventur he ask cautious there a pirat asleep in the pampa just beneath us peter told him if you like well go down and kill him i dont see him john said after a long paus i do suppos john said a littl huskili he were to wake up peter spoke indign you dont think i would kill him while he was sleep i would wake him first and then kill him that the way i alway do i say do you kill mani ton john said how rip but decid to have tea first he ask if there were mani pirat on the island just now and peter said he had never known so mani who is captain now hook answer peter and his face becam veri stern as he said that hate word jas hook ay then inde michael began to cri and even john could speak in gulp onli for they knew hook reput he was blackbeard bosun john whisper huskili he is the worst of them all he is the onli man of whom barbecu was afraid that him said peter what is he like is he big he is not so big as he was how do you mean i cut off a bit of him you yes me said peter sharpli i wasnt mean to be disrespect oh all right but i say what bit his right hand then he cant fight now oh cant he just left hander he has an iron hook instead of a right hand and he claw with it claw i say john said peter yes say ay ay sir ay ay sir there is one thing peter continu that everi boy who serv under me has to promis and so must you john pale it is this if we meet hook in open fight you must leav him to me i promis john said loyal for the moment they were feel less eeri becaus tink was fli with them and in her light they could distinguish each other unfortun she could not fli so slowli as they and so she had to go round and round them in a circl in which they move as in a halo wendi quit like it until peter point out the drawback she tell me he said that the pirat sight us befor the dark came and got long tom out the big gun yes and of cours they must see her light and if they guess we are near it they are sure to let fli wendi john michael tell her to go away at onc peter the three cri simultan but he refus she think we have lost the way he repli stiffli and she is rather frighten you dont think i would send her away all by herself when she is frighten for a moment the circl of light was broken and someth gave peter a love littl pinch then tell her wendi beg to put out her light she cant put it out that is about the onli thing fairi cant do it just goe out of itself when she fall asleep same as the star then tell her to sleep at onc john almost order she cant sleep except when shes sleepi it is the onli other thing fairi cant do seem to me growl john these are the onli two thing worth do here he got a pinch but not a love one if onli one of us had a pocket peter said we could carri her in it howev they had set off in such a hurri that there was not a pocket between the four of them he had a happi idea john hat tink agre to travel by hat if it was carri in the hand john carri it though she had hope to be carri by peter present wendi took the hat becaus john said it struck against his knee as he flew and this as we shall see led to mischief for tinker bell hate to be under an oblig to wendi in the black topper the light was complet hidden and they flew on in silenc it was the stillest silenc they had ever known broken onc by a distant lap which peter explain was the wild beast drink at the ford and again by a rasp sound that might have been the branch of tree rub togeth but he said it was the redskin sharpen their knive even these nois ceas to michael the loneli was dread if onli someth would make a sound he cri as if in answer to his request the air was rent by the most tremend crash he had ever heard the pirat had fire long tom at them the roar of it echo through the mountain and the echo seem to cri savag where are they where are they where are they thus sharpli did the terrifi three learn the differ between an island of make believ and the same island come true when at last the heaven were steadi again john and michael found themselv alon in the dark john was tread the air mechan and michael without know how to float was float are you shot john whisper tremul i havent tri myself out yet michael whisper back we know now that no one had been hit peter howev had been carri by the wind of the shot far out to sea while wendi was blown upward with no companion but tinker bell it would have been well for wendi if at that moment she had drop the hat i dont know whether the idea came sudden to tink or whether she had plan it on the way but she at onc pop out of the hat and began to lure wendi to her destruct tink was not all bad or rather she was all bad just now but on the other hand sometim she was all good fairi have to be one thing or the other becaus be so small they unfortun have room for one feel onli at a time they are howev allow to chang onli it must be a complet chang at present she was full of jealousi of wendi what she said in her love tinkl wendi could not of cours understand and i believ some of it was bad word but it sound kind and she flew back and forward plain mean follow me and all will be well what els could poor wendi do she call to peter and john and michael and got onli mock echo in repli she did not yet know that tink hate her with the fierc hatr of a veri woman and so bewild and now stagger in her flight she follow tink to her doom chapter 5 the island come true feel that peter was on his way back the neverland had again woke into life we ought to use the pluperfect and say waken but woke is better and was alway use by peter in his absenc thing are usual quiet on the island the fairi take an hour longer in the morn the beast attend to their young the redskin feed heavili for six day and night and when pirat and lost boy meet they mere bite their thumb at each other but with the come of peter who hate lethargi they are under way again if you put your ear to the ground now you would hear the whole island seeth with life on this even the chief forc of the island were dispos as follow the lost boy were out look for peter the pirat were out look for the lost boy the redskin were out look for the pirat and the beast were out look for the redskin they were go round and round the island but they did not meet becaus all were go at the same rate all want blood except the boy who like it as a rule but to night were out to greet their captain the boy on the island vari of cours in number accord as they get kill and so on and when they seem to be grow up which is against the rule peter thin them out but at this time there were six of them count the twin as two let us pretend to lie here among the sugar cane and watch them as they steal by in singl file each with his hand on his dagger they are forbidden by peter to look in the least like him and they wear the skin of the bear slain by themselv in which they are so round and furri that when they fall they roll they have therefor becom veri sure foot the first to pass is tootl not the least brave but the most unfortun of all that gallant band he had been in fewer adventur than ani of them becaus the big thing constant happen just when he had step round the corner all would be quiet he would take the opportun of go off to gather a few stick for firewood and then when he return the other would be sweep up the blood this ill luck had given a gentl melancholi to his counten but instead of sour his natur had sweeten it so that he was quit the humblest of the boy poor kind tootl there is danger in the air for you to night take care lest an adventur is now offer you which if accept will plung you in deepest woe tootl the fairi tink who is bent on mischief this night is look for a tool for do her mischief and she think you are the most easili trick of the boy ware tinker bell would that he could hear us but we are not realli on the island and he pass by bite his knuckl next come nib the gay and debonair follow by slight who cut whistl out of the tree and danc ecstat to his own tune slight is the most conceit of the boy he think he rememb the day befor he was lost with their manner and custom and this has given his nose an offens tilt cur is fourth he is a pickl a person who get in pickl predica and so often has he had to deliv up his person when peter said stern stand forth the one who did this thing that now at the command he stand forth automat whether he has done it or not last come the twin who cannot be describ becaus we should be sure to be describ the wrong one peter never quit knew what twin were and his band were not allow to know anyth he did not know so these two were alway vagu about themselv and did their best to give satisfact by keep close togeth in an apologet sort of way the boy vanish in the gloom and after a paus but not a long paus for thing go brisk on the island come the pirat on their track we hear them befor they are seen and it is alway the same dread song avast belay yo ho heav to a pirat we go and if were part by a shot were sure

at onc you naughti children i am sure your feet are damp and befor i put you to bed i have just time to finish the stori of cinderella in they went i dont know how there was room for them but you can squeez veri tight in the neverland and that was the first of the mani joyous even they had with wendi by and by she tuck them up in the great bed in the home under the tree but she herself slept that night in the littl hous and peter kept watch outsid with drawn sword for the pirat could be heard carous far away and the wolv were on the prowl the littl hous look so cosi and safe in the dark with a bright light show through it blind and the chimney smoke beauti and peter stand on guard after a time he fell asleep and some unsteadi fairi had to climb over him on their way home from an orgi ani of the other boy obstruct the fairi path at night they would have mischief but they just tweak peter nose and pass on chapter 7 the home under the ground one of the first thing peter did next day was to measur wendi and john and michael for hollow tree hook you rememb had sneer at the boy for think they need a tree apiec but this was ignor for unless your tree fit you it was difficult to go up and down and no two of the boy were quit the same size onc you fit you drew in let out your breath at the top and down you went at exact the right speed while to ascend you drew in and let out altern and so wriggl up of cours when you have master the action you are abl to do these thing without think of them and noth can be more grace but you simpli must fit and peter measur you for your tree as care as for a suit of cloth the onli differ be that the cloth are made to fit you while you have to be made to fit the tree usual it is done quit easili as by your wear too mani garment or too few but if you are bumpi in awkward place or the onli avail tree is an odd shape peter doe some thing to you and after that you fit onc you fit great care must be taken to go on fit and this as wendi was to discov to her delight keep a whole famili in perfect condit wendi and michael fit their tree at the first tri but john had to be alter a littl after a few day practic they could go up and down as gaili as bucket in a well and how ardent they grew to love their home under the ground especi wendi it consist of one larg room as all hous should do with a floor in which you could dig for worm if you want to go fish and in this floor grew stout mushroom of a charm colour which were use as stool a never tree tri hard to grow in the centr of the room but everi morn they saw the trunk through level with the floor by tea time it was alway about two feet high and then they put a door on top of it the whole thus becom a tabl as soon as they clear away they saw off the trunk again and thus there was more room to play there was an enorm fireplac which was in almost ani part of the room where you care to light it and across this wendi stretch string made of fibr from which she suspend her wash the bed was tilt against the wall by day and let down at 630 when it fill near half the room and all the boy slept in it except michael lie like sardin in a tin there was a strict rule against turn round until one gave the signal when all turn at onc michael should have use it also but wendi would have desir a babi and he was the littlest and you know what women are and the short and long of it is that he was hung up in a basket it was rough and simpl and not unlik what babi bear would have made of an underground hous in the same circumst but there was one recess in the wall no larger than a bird cage which was the privat apart of tinker bell it could be shut off from the rest of the hous by a tini curtain which tink who was most fastidi particular alway kept drawn when dress or undress no woman howev larg could have had a more exquisit boudoir dress room and bed chamber combin the couch as she alway call it was a genuin queen mab with club leg and she vari the bedspread accord to what fruit blossom was in season her mirror was a puss in boot of which there are now onli three unchip known to fairi dealer the washstand was pie crust and revers the chest of drawer an authent charm the sixth and the carpet and rug the best the earli period of margeri and robin there was a chandeli from tiddlywink for the look of the thing but of cours she lit the resid herself tink was veri contemptu of the rest of the hous as inde was perhap inevit and her chamber though beauti look rather conceit have the appear of a nose perman turn up i suppos it was all especi entranc to wendi becaus those rampagi boy of her gave her so much to do realli there were whole week when except perhap with a stock in the even she was never abov ground the cook i can tell you kept her nose to the pot and even if there was noth in it even if there was no pot she had to keep watch that it came aboil just the same you never exact knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make believ it all depend upon peter whim he could eat realli eat if it was part of a game but he could not stodg cram down the food just to feel stodgi stuf with food which is what most children like better than anyth els the next best thing be to talk about it make believ was so real to him that dure a meal of it you could see him get rounder of cours it was tri but you simpli had to follow his lead and if you could prove to him that you were get loos for your tree he let you stodg wendi favourit time for sew and darn was after they had all gone to bed then as she express it she had a breath time for herself and she occupi it in make new thing for them and put doubl piec on the knee for they were all most fright hard on their knee when she sat down to a basket of their stock everi heel with a hole in it she would fling up her arm and exclaim oh dear i am sure i sometim think spinster are to be envi her face beam when she exclaim this you rememb about her pet wolf well it veri soon discov that she had come to the island and it found her out and they just ran into each other arm after that it follow her about everywher as time wore on did she think much about the belov parent she had left behind her this is a difficult question becaus it is quit imposs to say how time doe wear on in the neverland where it is calcul by moon and sun and there are ever so mani more of them than on the mainland but i am afraid that wendi did not realli worri about her father and mother she was absolut confid that they would alway keep the window open for her to fli back by and this gave her complet eas of mind what did disturb her at time was that john rememb his parent vagu onli as peopl he had onc known while michael was quit will to believ that she was realli his mother these thing scare her a littl and nobli anxious to do her duti she tri to fix the old life in their mind by set them examin paper on it as like as possibl to the one she use to do at school the other boy thought this aw interest and insist on join and they made slate for themselv and sat round the tabl write and think hard about the question she had written on anoth slate and pass round they were the most ordinari questionswhat was the colour of mother eye which was taller father or mother was mother blond or brunett answer all three question if possibl a write an essay of not less than 40 word on how i spent my last holiday or the charact of father and mother compar onli one of these to be attempt or 1 describ mother laugh 2 describ father laugh 3 describ mother parti dress 4 describ the kennel and it inmat they were just everyday question like these and when you could not answer them you were told to make a cross and it was realli dread what a number of cross even john made of cours the onli boy who repli to everi question was slight and no one could have been more hope of come out first but his answer were perfect ridicul and he realli came out last a melancholi thing peter did not compet for one thing he despis all mother except wendi and for anoth he was the onli boy on the island who could neither write nor spell not the smallest word he was abov all that sort of thing by the way the question were all written in the past tens what was the colour of mother eye and so on wendi you see had been forget too adventur of cours as we shall see were of daili occurr but about this time peter invent with wendi help a new game that fascin him enorm until he sudden had no more interest in it which as you have been told was what alway happen with his game it consist in pretend not to have adventur in do the sort of thing john and michael had been do all their live sit on stool fling ball in the air push each other go out for walk and come back without have kill so much as a grizzli to see peter do noth on a stool was a great sight he could not help look solemn at such time to sit still seem to him such a comic thing to do he boast that he had gone walk for the good of his health for sever sun these were the most novel of all adventur to him and john and michael had to pretend to be delight also otherwis he would have treat them sever he often went out alon and when he came back you were never absolut certain whether he had had an adventur or not he might have forgotten it so complet that he said noth about it and then when you went out you found the bodi and on the other hand he might say a great deal about it and yet you could not find the bodi sometim he came home with his head bandag and then wendi coo over him and bath it in lukewarm water while he told a dazzl tale but she was never quit sure you know there were howev mani adventur which she knew to be true becaus she was in them herself and there were still more that were at least part true for the other boy were in them and said they were wholli true to describ them all would requir a book as larg as an english latin latin english dictionari and the most we can do is to give one as a specimen of an averag hour on the island the difficulti is which one to choos should we take the brush with the redskin at slight gulch it was a sanguinari cheer affair and especi interest as show one of peter peculiar which was that in the middl of a fight he would sudden chang side at the gulch when victori was still in the balanc sometim lean this way and sometim that he call out im redskin to day what are you tootl and tootl answer redskin what are you nib and nib said redskin what are you twin and so on and they were all redskin and of cours this would have end the fight had not the real redskin fascin by peter method agre to be lost boy for that onc and so at it they all went again more fierc than ever the extraordinari upshot of this adventur wasbut we have not decid yet that this is the adventur we are to narrat perhap a better one would be the night attack by the redskin on the hous under the ground when sever of them stuck in the hollow tree and had to be pull out like cork or we might tell how peter save tiger lili life in the mermaid lagoon and so made her his alli or we could tell of that cake the pirat cook so that the boy might eat it and perish and how they place it in one cun spot after anoth but alway wendi snatch it from the hand of her children so that in time it lost it succul and becam as hard as a stone and was use as a missil and hook fell over it in the dark or suppos we tell of the bird that were peter friend particular of the never bird that built in a tree overhang the lagoon and how the nest fell into the water and still the bird sat on her egg and peter gave order that she was not to be disturb that is a pretti stori and the end show how grate a bird can be but if we tell it we must also tell the whole adventur of the lagoon which would of cours be tell two adventur rather than just one a shorter adventur and quit as excit was tinker bell attempt with the help of some street fairi to have the sleep wendi convey on a great float leaf to the mainland fortun the leaf gave way and wendi woke think it was bath time and swam back or again we might choos peter defianc of the lion when he drew a circl round him on the ground with an arrow and dare them to cross it and though he wait for hour with the other boy and wendi look on breathless from tree not one of them dare to accept his challeng which of these adventur shall we choos the best way will be to toss for it i have toss and the lagoon has won this almost make one wish that the gulch or the cake or tink leaf had won of cours i could do it again and make it best out of three howev perhap fairest to stick to the lagoon chapter 8 the mermaid lagoon if you shut your eye and are a lucki one you may see at time a shapeless pool of love pale colour suspend in the dark then if you squeez your eye tighter the pool begin to take shape and the colour becom so vivid that with anoth squeez they must go on fire but just befor they go on fire you see the lagoon this is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland just one heaven moment if there could be two moment you might see the surf and hear the mermaid sing the children often spent long summer day on this lagoon swim or float most of the time play the mermaid game in the water and so forth you must not think from this that the mermaid were on friend term with them on the contrari it was among wendi last regret that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil word from one of them when she stole soft to the edg of the lagoon she might see them by the score especi on maroon rock where they love to bask comb out their hair in a lazi way that quit irrit her or she might even swim on tipto as it were to within a yard of them but then they saw her and dive probabl splash her with their tail not by accid but intent they treat all the boy in the same way except of cours peter who chat with them on maroon rock by the hour and sat on their tail when they got cheeki he gave wendi one of their comb the most haunt time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon when they utter strang wail cri but the lagoon is danger for mortal then and until the even of which we have now to tell wendi had never seen the lagoon by moonlight less from fear for of cours peter would have accompani her than becaus she had strict rule about everi one be in bed by seven she was often at the lagoon howev on sunni day after rain when the mermaid come up in extraordinari number to play with their bubbl the bubbl of mani colour made in rainbow water they treat as ball hit them gaili from one to anoth with their tail and tri to keep them in the rainbow till they burst the goal are at each end of the rainbow and the keeper onli are allow to use their hand sometim a dozen of these game will be go on in the lagoon at a time and it is quit a pretti sight but the moment the children tri to join in they had to play by themselv for the mermaid immedi disappear nevertheless we have proof that they secret watch the interlop and were not abov take an idea from them for john introduc a new way of hit the bubbl with the head instead of the hand and the mermaid adopt it this is the one mark that john has left on the neverland it must also have been rather pretti to see the children rest on a rock for half an hour after their mid day meal wendi insist on their do this and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was make believ so they lay there in the sun and their bodi glisten in it while she sat besid them and look import it was one such day and they were all on maroon rock the rock was not much larger than their great bed but of cours they all knew how not to take up much room and they were doze or at least lie with their eye shut and pinch occasion when they thought wendi was not look she was veri busi stitch while she stitch a chang came to the lagoon littl shiver ran over it and the sun went away and shadow stole across the water turn it cold wendi could no longer see to thread her needl and when she look up the lagoon that had alway hitherto been such a laugh place seem formid and unfriend it was not she knew that night had come but someth as dark as night had come no wors than that it had not come but it had sent that shiver through the sea to say that it was come what was it there crowd upon her all the stori she had been told of maroon rock so call becaus evil captain put sailor on it and leav them there to drown they drown when the tide rise for then it is submerg of cours she should have rous the children at onc not mere becaus of the unknown that was stalk toward them but becaus it was no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilli but she was a young mother and she did not know this she thought you simpli must stick to your rule about half an hour after the mid day meal so though fear was upon her and she long to hear male voic she would not waken them even when she heard the sound of muffl oar though her heart was in her mouth she did not waken them she stood over them to let them have their sleep out was it not brave of wendi it was well for those boy then that there was one among them who could sniff danger even in his sleep peter sprang erect as wide awak at onc as a dog and with one warn cri he rous the other he stood motionless one hand to his ear pirat he cri the other came closer to him a strang smile was play about his face and wendi saw it and shudder while that smile was on his face no one dare address him all they could do was to stand readi to obey the order came sharp and incis dive there was a gleam of leg and instant the lagoon seem desert maroon rock stood alon in the forbid water as if it were itself maroon the boat drew nearer it was the pirat dinghi with three figur in her smee and starkey and the third a captiv no other than tiger lili her hand and ankl were tie and she knew what was to be her fate she was to be left on the rock to perish an end to one of her race more terribl than death by fire or tortur for is it not written in the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the happi hunt ground yet her face was impass she was the daughter of a chief she must die as a chief daughter it is enough they had caught her board the pirat ship with a knife in her mouth no watch was kept on the ship it be hook boast that the wind of his name guard the ship for a mile around now her fate would help to guard it also one more wail would go the round in that wind by night in the gloom that they brought with them the two pirat did not see the rock till they crash into it luff you lubber cri an irish voic that was smee here the rock now then what we have to do is to hoist the redskin on to it and leav her here to drown it was the work of one brutal moment to land the beauti girl on the rock she was too proud to offer a vain resist quit near the rock but out of sight two head were bob up and down peter and wendi wendi was cri for it was the first tragedi she had seen peter had seen mani tragedi but he had forgotten them all he was less sorri than wendi for tiger lili it was two against one that anger him and he meant to save her an easi way would have been to wait until the pirat had gone but he was never one to choos the easi way there was almost noth he could not do and he now imit the voic of hook ahoy there you lubber he call it was a marvel imit the captain said the pirat stare at each other in surpris he must be swim out to us starkey said when they had look for him in vain we are put the redskin on the rock smee call out set her free came the astonish answer free yes cut her bond and let her go but captain at onc dye hear cri peter or ill plung my hook in you this is queer smee gasp better do what the captain order said starkey nervous ay ay smee said and he cut tiger lili cord at onc like an eel she slid between starkey leg into the water of cours wendi was veri elat over peter clever but she knew that he would be elat also and veri like crow and thus betray himself so at onc her hand went out to cover his mouth but it was stay even in the act for boat ahoy rang over the lagoon in hook voic and this time it was not peter who had spoken peter may have been about to crow but his face pucker in a whistl of surpris instead boat ahoy again came the voic now wendi understood the real hook was also in the water he was swim to the boat and as his men show a light to guid him he had soon reach them in the light of the lantern wendi saw his hook grip the boat side she saw his evil swarthi face as he rose drip from the water and quak she would have like to swim away but peter would not budg he was tingl with life and also top heavi with conceit am i not a wonder oh i am a wonder he whisper to her and though she thought so also she was realli glad for the sake of his reput that no one heard him except herself he sign to her to listen the two pirat were veri curious to know what had brought their captain to them but he sat with his head on his hook in a posit of profound melancholi captain is all well they ask timid but he answer with a hollow moan he sigh said smee he sigh again said starkey and yet a third time he sigh said smee then at last he spoke passion the game up he cri those boy have found a mother affright though she was wendi swell with pride o evil day cri starkey what a mother ask the ignor smee wendi was so shock that she exclaim he doesnt know and alway after this she felt that if you could have a pet pirat smee would be her one peter pull her beneath the water for hook had start up cri what was that i heard noth said starkey rais the lantern over the water and as the pirat look they saw a strang sight it was the nest i have told you of float on the lagoon and the never bird was sit

moment he recal innoc day whenbut he brush away this weak with his hook smee much impress gaze at the bird as the nest was born past but the more suspici starkey said if she is a mother perhap she is hang about here to help peter hook winc ay he said that is the fear that haunt me he was rous from this deject by smee eager voic captain said smee could we not kidnap these boy mother and make her our mother it is a princ scheme cri hook and at onc it took practic shape in his great brain we will seiz the children and carri them to the boat the boy we will make walk the plank and wendi shall be our mother again wendi forgot herself never she cri and bob what was that but they could see noth they thought it must have been a leaf in the wind do you agre my bulli ask hook there is my hand on it they both said and there is my hook swear they all swore by this time they were on the rock and sudden hook rememb tiger lili where is the redskin he demand abrupt he had a play humour at moment and they thought this was one of the moment that is all right captain smee answer complac we let her go let her go cri hook twas your own order the bosun falter you call over the water to us to let her go said starkey brimston and gall thunder hook what cozen cheat is go on here his face had gone black with rage but he saw that they believ their word and he was startl lad he said shake a littl i gave no such order it is pass queer smee said and they all fidget uncomfort hook rais his voic but there was a quiver in it spirit that haunt this dark lagoon to night he cri dost hear me of cours peter should have kept quiet but of cours he did not he immedi answer in hook voic odd bob hammer and tong i hear you in that suprem moment hook did not blanch even at the gill but smee and starkey clung to

but tragic figur though he had becom he scarc heed them against such fear evid it was not their belief in him that he need it was his own he felt his ego slip from him dont desert me bulli he whisper hoars to it in his dark natur there was a touch of the feminin as in all the great pirat and it sometim gave him intuit sudden he tri the guess game hook he call have you anoth voic now peter could never resist a game and he answer blith in his own voic i have and anoth name ay ay veget ask hook no miner no anim yes man no this answer rang out scorn boy yes ordinari boy no wonder boy to wendi pain the answer that rang out this time was yes are you in england no are you here yes hook was complet puzzl you ask him some question he said to the other wipe his damp brow smee reflect i cant think of a thing he said regret cant guess cant guess crow peter do you give it up of cours in his pride he was carri the game too far and the miscreant villain saw their chanc yes yes they answer eager well then he cri i am peter pan pan in a moment hook was himself again and smee and starkey were his faith henchmen now we have him hook shout into the water smee starkey mind the boat take him dead or aliv he leap as he spoke and simultan came the gay voic of peter are you readi boy ay ay from various part of the lagoon then lam into the pirat the fight was short and sharp first to draw blood was john who gallant climb into the boat and held starkey there was fierc struggl in which the cutlass was torn from the pirat grasp he wriggl overboard and john leapt after him the dinghi drift away here and there a head bob up in the water and there was a flash of steel follow by a cri or a whoop in the confus some struck at their own side the corkscrew of smee got tootl in the fourth rib but he was himself pink nick in turn by cur farther from the rock starkey was press slight and the twin hard where all this time was peter he was seek bigger game the other were all brave boy and they must not be blame for back from the pirat captain his iron claw made a circl of dead water round him from which they fled like affright fish but there was one who did not fear him there was one prepar to enter that circl strang it was not in the water that they met hook rose to the rock to breath and at the same moment peter scale it on the opposit side the rock was slipperi as a ball and they had to crawl rather than climb neither knew that the other was come each feel for a grip met the other arm in surpris they rais their head their face were almost touch so they met some of the greatest hero have confess that just befor they fell to began combat they had a sink feel in the stomach had it been so with peter at that moment i would admit it after all he was the onli man that the sea cook had fear but peter had no sink he had one feel onli glad and he gnash his pretti teeth with joy quick as thought he snatch a knife from hook belt and was about to drive it home when he saw that he was higher up the rock that his foe it would not have been fight fair he gave the pirat a hand to help him up it was then that hook bit him not the pain of this but it unfair was what daze peter it made him quit helpless he could onli stare horrifi everi child is affect thus the first time he is treat unfair all he think he has a right to when he come to you to be your is fair after you have been unfair to him he will love you again but will never afterward be quit the same boy no one ever get over the first unfair no one except peter he often met it but he alway forgot it i suppos that was the real differ between him and all the rest so when he met it now it was like the first time and he could just stare helpless twice the iron hand claw him a few moment afterward the other boy saw hook in the water strike wild for the ship no elat on the pestil face now onli white fear for the crocodil was in dog pursuit of him on ordinari occas the boy would have swum alongsid cheer but now they were uneasi for they had lost both peter and wendi and were scour the lagoon for them call them by name they found the dinghi and went home in it shout peter wendi as they went but no answer came save mock laughter from the mermaid they must be swim back or fli the boy conclud they were not veri anxious becaus they had such faith in peter they chuckl boylik becaus they would be late for bed and it was all mother wendi fault when their voic die away there came cold silenc over the lagoon and then a feebl cri help help two small figur were beat against the rock the girl had faint and lay on the boy arm with a last effort peter pull her up the rock and then lay down besid her even as he also faint he saw that the water was rise he knew that they would soon be drown but he could do no more as they lay side by side a mermaid caught wendi by the feet and began pull her soft into the water peter feel her slip from him woke with a start and was just in time to draw her back but he had to tell her the truth we are on the rock wendi he said but it is grow smaller soon the water will be over it she did not understand even now we must go she said almost bright yes he answer faint shall we swim or fli peter he had to tell her do you think you could swim or fli as far as the island wendi without my help she had to admit that she was too tire he moan what is it she ask anxious about him at onc i cant help you wendi hook wound me i can neither fli nor swim do you mean we shall both be drown look how the water is rise they put their hand over their eye to shut out the sight they thought they would soon be no more as they sat thus someth brush against peter as light as a kiss and stay there as if say timid can i be of ani use it was the tail of a kite which michael had made some day befor it had torn itself out of his hand and float away michael kite peter said without interest but next moment he had seiz the tail and was pull the kite toward him it lift michael off the ground he cri whi should it not carri you both of us it cant lift two michael and cur tri let us draw lot wendi said brave and you a ladi never alreadi he had tie the tail round her she clung to him she refus to go without him but with a good bye wendi he push her from the rock and in a few minut she was born out of his sight peter was alon on the lagoon the rock was veri small now soon it would be submerg pale ray of light tipto across the water and by and by there was to be heard a sound at onc the most music and the most melancholi in the world the mermaid call to the moon peter was not quit like other boy but he was afraid at last a tremour ran through him like a shudder pass over the sea but on the sea one shudder follow anoth till there are hundr of them and peter felt just the one next moment he was stand erect on the rock again with that smile on his face and a drum beat within him it was say to die will be an aw big adventur chapter 9 the never bird the last sound peter heard befor he was quit alon were the mermaid retir one by one to their bedchamb under the sea he was too far away to hear their door shut but everi door in the coral cave where they live ring a tini bell when it open or close as in all the nicest hous on the mainland and he heard the bell steadili the water rose till they were nibbl at his feet and to pass the time until they made their final gulp he watch the onli thing on the lagoon he thought it was a piec of float paper perhap part of the kite and wonder idl how long it would take to drift ashor present he notic as an odd thing that it was undoubt out upon the lagoon with some definit purpos for it was fight the tide and sometim win and when it won peter alway sympathet to the weaker side could not help clap it was such a gallant piec of paper it was not realli a piec of paper it was the never bird make desper effort to reach peter on the nest by work her wing in a way she had learn sinc the nest fell into the water she was abl to some extent to guid her strang craft but by the time peter recognis her she was veri exhaust she had come to save him to give him her nest though there were egg in it i rather wonder at the bird for though he had been nice to her he had also sometim torment her i can suppos onli that like mrs darl and the rest of them she was melt becaus he had all his first teeth she call out to him what she had come for and he call out to her what she was do there but of cours neither of them understood the other languag in fanci stori peopl can talk to the bird freeli and i wish for the moment i could pretend that this were such a stori and say that peter repli intellig to the never bird but truth is best and i want to tell you onli what realli happen well not onli could they not understand each other but they forgot their manner iwantyoutogetintothenest the bird call speak as slowli and distinct as possibl andthenyoucandriftashor butiamtootiredtobringitanynearersoyoumusttri toswimtoit what are you quack about peter answer whi dont you let the nest drift as usual iwantyou the bird said and repeat it all over then peter tri slow and distinct whatareyouquackingabout and so on the never bird becam irrit they have veri short temper you dunderhead littl jay she scream whi dont you do as i tell you peter felt that she was call him name and at a ventur he retort hot so are you then rather curious they both snap out the same remark shut up shut up nevertheless the bird was determin to save him if she could and by one last mighti effort she propel the nest against the rock then up she flew desert her egg so as to make her mean clear then at last he understood and clutch the nest and wave his thank to the bird as she flutter overhead it was not to receiv his thank howev that she hung there in the sky it was not even to watch him get into the nest it was to see what he did with her egg there were two larg white egg and peter lift them up and reflect the bird cover her face with her wing so as not to see the last of them but she could not help peep between the feather i forget whether i have told you that there was a stave on the rock driven into it by some buccan of long ago to mark the site of buri treasur the children had discov the glitter hoard and when in a mischiev mood use to fling shower of moidor diamond pearl and piec of eight to the gull who pounc upon them for food and then flew away rage at the scurvi trick that had been play upon them the stave was still there and on it starkey had hung his hat a deep tarpaulin watertight with a broad brim peter put the egg into this hat and set it on the lagoon it float beauti the never bird saw at onc what he was up to and scream her admir of him and ala peter crow his agreement with her then he got into the nest rear the stave in it as a mast and hung up his shirt for a sail at the same moment the bird flutter down upon the hat and onc more sat snug on her egg she drift in one direct and he was born off in anoth both cheer of cours when peter land he beach his barqu small ship actual the never bird nest in this particular case in point in a place where the bird would easili find it but the hat was such a great success that she abandon the nest it drift about till it went to piec and often starkey came to the shore of the lagoon and with mani bitter feel watch the bird sit on his hat as we shall not see her again it may be worth mention here that all never bird now build in that shape of nest with a broad brim on which the youngster take an air great were the rejoic when peter reach the home under the ground almost as soon as wendi who had been carri hither and thither by the kite everi boy had adventur to tell but perhap the biggest adventur of all was that they were sever hour late for bed this so inflat them that they did various dodgi thing to get stay up still longer such as demand bandag but wendi though glori in have them all home again safe and sound was scandalis by the late of the hour and cri to bed to bed in a voic that had to be obey next day howev she was aw tender and gave out bandag to everi one and they play till bed time at limp about and carri their arm in sling chapter 10 the happi home one import result of the brush with the pirat on the lagoon was that it made the redskin their friend peter had save tiger lili from a dread fate and now there was noth she and her brave would not do for him all night they sat abov keep watch over the home under the ground and await the big attack by the pirat which obvious could not be much longer delay even by day they hung about smoke the pipe of peac and look almost as if they want tit bit to eat they call peter the great white father prostrat themselv lie down befor him and he like this tremend so that it was not realli good for him the great white father he would say to them in a veri lord manner as they grovel at his feet is glad to see the piccaninni warrior protect his wigwam from the pirat me tiger lili that love creatur would repli peter pan save me me his velli nice friend me no let pirat hurt him she was far too pretti to cring in this way but peter thought it his due and he would answer condescend it is good peter pan has spoken alway when he said peter pan has spoken it meant that they must now shut up and they accept it humbl in that spirit but they were by no mean so respect to the other boy whom they look upon as just ordinari brave they said how do to them and thing like that and what annoy the boy was that peter seem to think this all right secret wendi sympathis with them a littl but she was far too loyal a housewif to listen to ani complaint against father father know best she alway said whatev her privat opinion must be her privat opinion was that the redskin should not call her a squaw we have now reach the even that was to be known among them as the night of night becaus of it adventur and their upshot the day as if quiet gather it forc had been almost unev and now the redskin in their blanket were at their post abov while below the children were have their even meal all except peter who had gone out to get the time the way you got the time on the island was to find the crocodil and then stay near him till the clock struck the meal happen to be a make believ tea and they sat around the board guzzl in their greed and realli what with their chatter and recrimin the nois as wendi said was posit deafen to be sure she did not mind nois but she simpli would not have them grab thing and then excus themselv by say that tootl had push

too much of cours it was onli water but it was out of a bottl and she alway shook the bottl and count the drop which gave it a certain medicin qualiti on this occas howev she did not give peter his draught portion for just as she had prepar it she saw a look on his face that made her heart sink get your thing peter she cri shake no he answer pretend indiffer i am not go with you wendi yes peter no to show that her departur would leav him unmov he skip up and down the room play gaili on his heartless pipe she had to run about after him though it was rather undignifi to find your mother she coax now if peter had ever quit had a mother he no longer miss her he could do veri well without one he had thought them out and rememb onli their bad point no no he told wendi decis perhap she would say i was old and i just want alway to be a littl boy and to have fun but peter no and so the other had to be told peter isnt come peter not come they gaze blank at him their stick over their back and on each stick a bundl their first thought was that if peter was not go he had probabl chang his mind about let them go but he was far too proud for that if you find your mother he said dark i hope you will like them the aw cynic of this made an uncomfort impress and most of them began to look rather doubt after all their face said were they not noodl to want to go now then cri peter no fuss no blubber good bye wendi and he held out his hand cheerili quit as if they must realli go now for he had someth import to do she had to take his hand and there was no indic that he would prefer a thimbl you will rememb about chang your flannel peter she said linger over him she was alway so particular about their flannel yes and you will take your medicin yes that seem to be everyth and an awkward paus follow peter howev was not the kind that break down befor other peopl are you readi tinker bell he call out ay ay then lead the way tink dart up the nearest tree but no one follow her for it was at this moment that the pirat made their dread attack upon the redskin abov where all had been so still the air was rent with shriek and the clash of steel below there was dead silenc mouth open and remain open wendi fell on her knee but her arm were extend toward peter all arm were extend to him as if sudden blown in his direct they were beseech him mute not to desert them as for peter he seiz his sword the same he thought he had slain barbecu with and the lust of battl was in his eye chapter 12 the children are carri off the pirat attack had been a complet surpris a sure proof that the unscrupul hook had conduct it improp for to surpris redskin fair is beyond the wit of the white man by all the unwritten law of savag warfar it is alway the redskin who attack and with the wili of his race he doe it just befor the dawn at which time he know the courag of the white to be at it lowest ebb the white men have in the meantim made a rude stockad on the summit of yonder undul ground at the foot of which a stream run for it is destruct to be too far from water there they await the onslaught the inexperienc one clutch their revolv and tread on twig but the old hand sleep tranquilli until just befor the dawn through the long black night the savag scout wriggl snake like among the grass without stir a blade the brushwood close behind them as silent as sand into which a mole has dive not a sound is to be heard save when they give vent to a wonder imit of the lone call of the coyot the cri is answer by other brave and some of them do it even better than the coyot who are not veri good at it so the chill hour wear on and the long suspens is horribl tri to the palefac who has to live through it for the first time but to the train hand those ghast call and still ghastlier silenc are but an intim of how the night is march that this was the usual procedur was so well known to hook that in disregard it he cannot be excus on the plea of ignor the piccaninni on their part trust implicit to his honour and their whole action of the night stand out in mark contrast to his they left noth undon that was consist with the reput of their tribe with that alert of the sens which is at onc the marvel and despair of civilis peopl they knew that the pirat were on the island from the moment one of them trod on a dri stick and in an incred short space of time the coyot cri began everi foot of ground between the spot where hook had land his forc and the home under the tree was stealthili examin by brave wear their mocassin with the heel in front they found onli one hillock with a stream at it base so that hook had no choic here he must establish himself and wait for just befor the dawn everyth be thus map out with almost diabol cun the main bodi of the redskin fold their blanket around them and in the phlegmat manner that is to them the pearl of manhood squat abov the children home await the cold moment when they should deal pale death here dream though wide awak of the exquisit tortur to which they were to put him at break of day those confid savag were found by the treacher hook from the account afterward suppli by such of the scout as escap the carnag he doe not seem even to have paus at the rise ground though it is certain that in that grey light he must have seen it no thought of wait to be attack appear from first to last to have visit his subtl mind he would not even hold off till the night was near spent on he pound with no polici but to fall to get into combat what could the bewild scout do master as they were of everi war like artific save this one but trot helpless after him expos themselv fatal to view while they gave pathet utter to the coyot cri around the brave tiger lili were a dozen of her stoutest warrior and they sudden saw the perfidi pirat bear down upon them fell from their eye then the film through which they had look at victori no more would they tortur at the stake for them the happi hunt ground was now they knew it but as their father son they acquit themselv even then they had time to gather in a phalanx dens format that would have been hard to break had they risen quick but this they were forbidden to do by the tradit of their race it is written that the nobl savag must never express surpris in the presenc of the white thus terribl as the sudden appear of the pirat must have been to them they remain stationari for a moment not a muscl move as if the foe had come by invit then inde the tradit gallant upheld they seiz their weapon and the air was torn with the war cri but it was now too late it is no part of our to describ what was a massacr rather than a fight thus perish mani of the flower of the piccaninni tribe not all unaveng did they die for with lean wolf fell alf mason to disturb the spanish main no more and among other who bit the dust were geo scouri chas turley and the alsatian foggerti turley fell to the tomahawk of the terribl panther who ultim cut a way through the pirat with tiger lili and a small remnant of the tribe to what extent hook is to blame for his tactic on this occas is for the historian to decid had he wait on the rise ground till the proper hour he and his men would probabl have been butcher and in judg him it is onli fair to take this into account what he should perhap have done was to acquaint his oppon that he propos to follow a new method on the other hand this as destroy the element of surpris would have made his strategi of no avail so that the whole question is beset with difficulti one cannot at least withhold a reluct admir for the wit that had conceiv so bold a scheme and the fell dead genius with which it was carri out what were his own feel about himself at that triumphant moment fain glad would his dog have known as breath heavili and wipe their cutlass they gather at a discreet distanc from his hook and squint through their ferret eye at this extraordinari man elat must have been in his heart but his face did not reflect it ever a dark and solitari enigma he stood aloof from his follow in spirit as in substanc the night work was not yet over for it was not the redskin he had come out to destroy they were but the bee to be smoke so that he should get at the honey it was pan he want pan and wendi and their band but chiefli pan peter was such a small boy that one tend to wonder at the man hatr of him true he had flung hook arm to the crocodil but even this and the increas insecur of life to which it led owe to the crocodil pertinac persist hard account for a vindict so relentless and malign the truth is that there was a someth about peter which goad the pirat captain to frenzi it was not his courag it was not his engag appear it was not there is no beat about the bush for we know quit well what it was and have got to tell it was peter cocki this had got on hook nerv it made his iron claw twitch and at night it disturb him like an insect while peter live the tortur man felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come the question now was how to get down the tree or how to get his dog down he ran his greedi eye over them search for the thinnest one they wriggl uncomfort for they knew he would not scrupl hesit to ram them down with pole in the meantim what of the boy we have seen them at the first clang of the weapon turn as it were into stone figur open mouth all appeal with outstretch arm to peter and we return to them as their mouth close and their arm fall to their side the pandemonium abov has ceas almost as sudden as it aros pass like a fierc gust of wind but they know that in the pass it has determin their fate which side had won the pirat listen avid at the mouth of the tree heard the question put by everi boy and ala they also heard peter answer if the redskin have won he said they will beat the tom tom it is alway their sign of victori now smee had found the tom tom and was at that moment sit on it you will never hear the tom tom again he mutter but inaud of cours for strict silenc had been enjoin urg to his amaz hook sign him to beat the tom tom and slowli there came to smee an understand of the dread wicked of the order never probabl had this simpl man admir hook so much twice smee beat upon the instrument and then stop to listen gleefulli the tom tom the miscreant heard peter cri an indian victori the doom children answer with a cheer that was music to the black heart abov and almost immedi they repeat their good bye to peter this puzzl the pirat but all their other feel were swallow by a base delight that the enemi were about to come up the tree they smirk at each other and rub their hand rapid and silent hook gave his order one man to each tree and the other to arrang themselv in a line two yard apart chapter 13 do you believ in fairi the more quick this horror is dispos of the better the first to emerg from his tree was cur he rose out of it into the arm of cecco who flung him to smee who flung him to starkey who flung him to bill juke who flung him to noodler and so he was toss from one to anoth till he fell at the feet of the black pirat all the boy were pluck from their tree in this ruthless manner and sever of them were in the air at a time like bale of good flung from hand to hand a differ treatment was accord to wendi who came last with iron polit hook rais his hat to her and offer her his arm escort her to the spot where the other were be gag he did it with such an air he was so fright distingu impos distinguish that she was too fascin to cri out she was onli a littl girl perhap it is tell tale to divulg that for a moment hook entranc her and we tell on her onli becaus her slip led to strang result had she haughtili unhand him and we should have love to write it of her she would have been hurl through the air like the other and then hook would probabl not have been present at the tie of the children and had he not been at the tie he would not have discov slight secret and without the secret he could not present have made his foul attempt on peter life they were tie to prevent their fli away doubl up with their knee close to their ear and for the truss of them the black pirat had cut a rope into nine equal piec all went well until slight turn came when he was found to be like those irrit parcel that use up all the string in go round and leav no tag end with which to tie a knot the pirat kick him in their rage just as you kick the parcel though in fair you should kick the string and strang to say it was hook who told them to belay their violenc his lip was curl with malici triumph while his dog were mere sweat becaus everi time they tri to pack the unhappi lad tight in one part he bulg out in anoth hook master mind had gone far beneath slight surfac probe not for effect but for caus and his exult show that he had found them slight white to the gill knew that hook had surpris discov his secret which was this that no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an averag man need stick poor slight most wretch of all the children now for he was in a panic about peter bitter regret what he had done mad addict to the drink of water when he was hot he had swell in consequ to his present girth and instead of reduc himself to fit his tree he had unknown to the other whittl his tree to make it fit him suffici of this hook guess to persuad him that peter at last lay at his merci but no word of the dark design that now form in the subterranean cavern of his mind cross his lip he mere sign that the captiv were to be convey to the ship and that he would be alon how to convey them hunch up in their rope they might inde be roll down hill like barrel but most of the way lay through a morass again hook genius surmount difficulti he indic that the littl hous must be use as a convey the children were flung into it four stout pirat rais it on their shoulder the other fell in behind and sing the hate pirat chorus the strang process set off through the wood i dont know whether ani of the children were cri if so the sing drown the sound but as the littl hous disappear in the forest a brave though tini jet of smoke issu from it chimney as if defi hook hook saw it and it did peter a bad servic it dri up ani trickl of piti for him that may have remain in the pirat infuri breast the first thing he did on find himself alon in the fast fall night was to tipto to slight tree and make sure that it provid him with a passag then for long he remain brood his hat of ill omen on the sward so that ani gentl breez which had arisen might play refresh through his hair dark as were his thought his blue eye were as soft as the periwinkl intent he listen for ani sound from the nether world but all was as silent below as abov the hous under the ground seem to be but one more empti tenement in the void was that boy asleep or did he stand wait at the foot of slight tree with his dagger in his hand there was no way of know save by go down hook let his cloak slip soft to the ground and then bite his lip till a lewd blood stood on them he step into the tree he was a brave man but for a moment he had to stop there and wipe his brow which was drip like a candl then silent he let himself go into the unknown he arriv unmolest at the foot of the shaft and stood still again bite at his breath which had almost left him as his eye becam accustom to the dim light various object in the home under the tree took shape but the onli one on which his greedi gaze rest long sought for and found at last was the great bed on the bed lay peter fast asleep unawar of the tragedi be enact abov peter had continu for a littl time after the children left to play gaili on his pipe no doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care then he decid not to take his medicin so as to griev wendi then he lay down on the bed outsid the coverlet to vex her still more for she had alway tuck them insid it becaus you never know that you may not grow chilli at the turn of the night then he near cri but it struck him how indign she would be if he laugh instead so he laugh a haughti laugh and fell asleep in the middl of it sometim though not often he had dream and they were more pain than the dream of other boy for hour he could not be separ from these dream though he wail piteous in them they had to do i think with the riddl of his exist at such time it had been wendi custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap sooth him in dear way of her own invent and when he grew calmer to put him back to bed befor he quit woke up so that he should not know of the indign to which she had subject him but on this occas he had fallen at onc into a dreamless sleep one arm drop over the edg of the bed one leg was arch and the unfinish part of his laugh was strand on his mouth which was open show the littl pearl thus defenceless hook found him he stood silent at the foot of the tree look across the chamber at his enemi did no feel of compass disturb his sombr breast the man was not wholli evil he love flower i have been told and sweet music he was himself no mean perform on the harpsichord and let it be frank admit the idyl natur of the scene stir him profound master by his better self he would have return reluct up the tree but for one thing what stay him was peter impertin appear as he slept the open mouth the droop arm the arch knee they were such a personif of cocki as taken togeth will never again one may hope be present to eye so sensit to their offens they steel hook heart if his rage had broken him into a hundr piec everi one of them would have disregard the incid and leapt at the sleeper though a light from the one lamp shone dim on the bed hook stood in dark himself and at the first stealthi step forward he discov an obstacl the door of slight tree it did not entir fill the apertur and he had been look over it feel for the catch he found to his furi that it was low down beyond his reach to his disord brain it seem then that the irrit qualiti in peter face and figur visibl increas and he rattl the door and flung himself against it was his enemi to escap him after all but what was that the red in his eye had caught sight of peter medicin stand on a ledg within easi reach he fathom what it was straightaway and immedi knew that the sleeper was in his power lest he should be taken aliv hook alway carri about his person a dread drug blend by himself of all the death deal ring that had come into his possess these he had boil down into a yellow liquid quit unknown to scienc which was probabl the most virul poison in exist five drop of this he now ad to peter cup his hand shook but it was in exult rather than in shame as he did it he avoid glanc at the sleeper but not lest piti should unnerv him mere to avoid spill then one long gloat look he cast upon his victim and turn worm his way with difficulti up the tree as he emerg at the top he look the veri spirit of evil break from it hole don his hat at it most rakish angl he wound his cloak around him hold one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night of which it was the blackest part and mutter strang to himself stole away through the tree peter slept on the light gutter burn to edg and went out leav the tenement in dark but still he slept it must have been not less than ten oclock by the crocodil when he sudden sat up in his bed waken by he knew not what it was a soft cautious tap on the door of his tree soft and cautious but in that still it was sinist peter felt for his dagger till his hand grip it then he spoke who is that for long there was no answer then again the knock who are you no answer he was thrill and he love be thrill in two stride he reach the door unlik slight door it fill the apertur open so that he could not see beyond it nor could the one knock see him i wont open unless you speak peter cri then at last the visitor spoke in a love bell like voic let me in peter it was tink and quick he unbar to her she flew in excit her face flush and her dress stain with mud what is it oh you could never guess she cri and offer him three guess out with it he shout and in one ungrammat sentenc as long as the ribbon that conjur magician pull from their mouth she told of the captur of wendi and the boy peter heart bob up and down as he listen wendi bound and on the pirat ship she who love everyth to be just so ill rescu her he cri leap at his weapon as he leapt he thought of someth he could do to pleas her he could take his medicin his hand close on the fatal draught no shriek tinker bell who had heard hook mutter about his deed as he sped through the forest whi not it is poison poison who could have poison it hook dont be silli how could hook have got down here ala tinker bell could not explain this for even she did not know the dark secret of slight tree nevertheless hook word had left no room for doubt the cup was poison besid said peter quit believ himself i never fell asleep he rais the cup no time for word now time for deed and with one of her lightn movement tink got between his lip and the draught and drain it to the dreg whi tink how dare you drink my medicin but she did not answer alreadi she was reel in the air what is the matter with you cri peter sudden afraid it was poison peter she told him soft and now i am go to be dead o tink did you drink it to save me yes but whi tink her wing would scarc carri her now but in repli she alight on his shoulder and gave his nose a love bite she whisper in his ear you silli ass and then totter to her chamber lay down on the bed his head almost fill the fourth wall of her littl room as he knelt near her in distress everi moment her light was grow fainter and he knew that if it went out she would be no more she like his tear so much that she put out her beauti finger and let them run over it her voic was so low that at first he could not make out what she said then he made it out she was say that she thought she could get well again if children believ in fairi peter flung out his arm there were no children there and it was night time but he address all who might be dream of the neverland and who were therefor nearer to him than you think boy and girl in their nighti and nake papoos in their basket hung from tree do you believ he cri tink sat up in bed almost brisk to listen to her fate she fanci she heard answer in the affirm and then again she wasnt sure what do you think she ask peter if you believ he shout to them clap your hand dont let tink die mani clap some didnt a few beast hiss the clap stop sudden as if countless mother had rush to their nurseri to see what on earth was happen but alreadi tink was save first her voic grew strong then she pop out of bed then she was flash through the room more merri and impud than ever she never thought of thank those who believ but she would have like to get at the one who had hiss and now to rescu wendi the moon was ride in a cloudi heaven when peter rose from his tree begirt belt with weapon and wear littl els to set out upon his peril quest it was not such a night as he would have chosen he had hope to fli keep not far from the ground so that noth unwont should escap his eye but in that fit light to have flown low would have meant trail his shadow through the tree thus disturb bird and acquaint a watch foe that he was astir he regret now that he had given the bird of the island such strang name that they are veri wild and difficult of approach there was no other cours but to press forward in redskin fashion at which

been tidi for year there was not a porthol on the grimi glass of which you might not have written with your finger dirti pig and she had alreadi written it on sever but as the boy gather round her she had no thought of cours save for them so my beauti said hook as if he spoke in syrup you are to see your children walk the plank fine gentlemen though he was the intens of his commune had soil his

the mast the eye of all were on the plank that last littl walk they were about to take they were no longer abl to hope that they would walk it man for the capac to think had gone from them they could stare and shiver onli hook smile on them with his teeth close and took a step toward wendi his intent was to turn her face so that she should see the boy walk the plank one by one but he never reach her he never heard the cri of anguish he hope to wring from her he heard someth els instead it was the terribl tick tick of the crocodil they all heard itpir boy wendi and immedi everi head was blown in one direct not to the water whenc the sound proceed but toward hook all knew that what was about to happen concern him alon and that from be actor they were sudden becom spectat veri fright was it to see the chang that came over him it was as if he had been clip at everi joint he fell in a littl heap the sound came steadili nearer and in advanc of it came this ghast thought the crocodil is about to board the ship even the iron claw hung inact as if know that it was no intrins part of what the attack forc want left so fear alon ani other man would have lain with his eye shut where he fell but the gigant brain of hook was still work and under it guidanc he crawl on the knee along the deck as far from the sound as he could go the pirat respect clear a passag for him and it was onli when he brought up against the bulwark that he spoke hide me he cri hoars they gather round him all eye avert from the thing that was come aboard they had no thought of fight it it was fate onli when hook was hidden from them did curios loosen the limb of the boy so that they could rush to the ship side to see the crocodil climb it then they got the strangest surpris of the night of night for it was no crocodil that was come to their aid it was peter he sign to them not to give vent to ani cri of admir that might rous suspicion then he went on tick chapter 15 hook or me this time odd thing happen to all of us on our way through life without our notic for a time that they have happen thus to take an instanc we sudden discov that we have been deaf in one ear for we dont know how long but say half an hour now such an experi had come that night to peter when last we saw him he was steal across the island with one finger to his lip and his dagger at the readi he had seen the crocodil pass by without notic anyth peculiar about it but by and by he rememb that it had not been tick at first he thought this eeri but soon conclud right that the clock had run down without give a thought to what might be the feel of a fellow creatur thus abrupt depriv of it closest companion peter began to consid how he could turn the catastroph to his own use and he decid to tick so that wild beast should believ he was the crocodil and let him pass unmolest he tick superbl but with one unforeseen result the crocodil was among those who heard the sound and it follow him though whether with the purpos of regain what it had lost or mere as a friend under the belief that it was again tick itself will never be certain known for like slave to a fix idea it was a stupid beast peter reach the shore without mishap and went straight on his leg encount the water as if quit unawar that they had enter a new element thus mani anim pass from land to water but no other human of whom i know as he swam he had but one thought hook or me this time he had tick so long that he now went on tick without know that he was do it had he known he would have stop for to board the brig by help of the tick though an ingeni idea had not occur to him on the contrari he thought he had scale her side as noiseless as a mous and he was amaz to see the pirat cower from him with hook in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodil the crocodil no sooner did peter rememb it than he heard the tick at first he thought the sound did come from the crocodil and he look behind him swift then he realis that he was do it himself and in a flash he understood the situat how clever of me he thought at onc and sign to the boy not to burst into applaus it was at this moment that ed teynt the quartermast emerg from the forecastl and came along the deck now reader time what happen by your watch peter struck true and deep john clap his hand on the ill fate pirat mouth to stifl the die groan he fell forward

terribl sound had pass it gone captain smee said wipe off his spectacl all still again slowli hook let his head emerg from his ruff and listen so intent that he could have caught the echo of the tick there was not a sound and he drew himself up firm to his full height then here to johnni plank he cri brazen hate the boy more than ever becaus they had seen him unbend he broke into the villain ditti yo ho yo ho the friski plank you walk along it so till it goe down and you goe down to davi jone below to terror the prison the more though with a certain loss of digniti he danc along an imaginari

listen but not one dare to face the door yes one wendi who all this time had been bound to the mast it was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watch it was for the reappear of peter she had not long to wait in the cabin he had found the thing for which he had gone in search the key that would free the children of their manacl and now they all stole forth arm with such weapon as they could find first sign them to hide peter cut wendi bond and then noth could have been easier than for them all to fli off togeth but one thing bar the way an oath hook or me this time so when he had freed wendi he whisper for her to conceal herself with the other and himself took her place by the mast her cloak around him so that he should pass for her then he took a great breath and crow to the pirat it was a voic cri that all the boy lay slain in the cabin and they were panic stricken hook tri to hearten them but like the dog he had made them they show him their fang and he knew that if he

a gestur to use his foot it made peter kick instead of stab at last hook had got the boon for which he crave bad form he cri jeer and went content to the crocodil thus perish jame hook seventeen slight sang out but he was not quit correct in his figur fifteen paid the penalti for their crime that night but two reach the shore starkey to be captur by the redskin who made him nurs for all their

kill one and then she took them into hook cabin and point to his watch which was hang on a nail it said half past one the late of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all she got them to bed in the pirat bunk pretti quick you may be sure all but peter who strut up and down on the deck until at last he fell asleep by the side of long tom he had one of his dream that night and cri in his sleep for a long time and wendi held him tight chapter 16 the return home by three bell that morn they were all stir their stump leg for there was a big sea run and tootl the bosun was among them with a rope end in his hand and chew tobacco they all don pirat cloth cut off at the knee shave smart and tumbl up with the true nautic roll and hitch their trouser it need not be said who was the captain

deliv a short address to them said he hope they would do their duti like gallant hearti but that he knew they were the scum of rio and the gold coast and if they snap at him he would tear them the bluff strident word struck the note sailor understood and they cheer him lustili then a few sharp order were given and they turn the ship round and nose her for the mainland captain pan calcul after consult the ship chart that if this weather last they should strike the azor about the 21st of june after which it would save time to fli some of them want it to be an honest ship and other were in favour of keep it a pirat but the captain treat them as dog and they dare not express their wish to him even in a round robin one person after anoth as they had to cpt hook instant obedi was the onli safe thing slight got a dozen for look perplex when told to take sound the general feel was that peter was honest just now to lull wendi suspicion but that there might be a chang when the new suit was readi which against her will she was make for him out of some of hook wickedest garment it was afterward whisper among them that on the first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin with hook cigar holder in his mouth and one hand clench all but for the forefing which he bent and held threaten aloft like a hook instead of watch the ship howev we must now return to that desol home from

could not have been a loveli sight but there was none to see it except a littl boy who was stare in at the window he had had ecstasi innumer that other children can never know but he was look through the window at the one joy from which he must be for ever bar chapter 17 when wendi grew up i hope you want to know what becam of the other boy they were wait below to give wendi time to explain about them and when they had count five hundr they went up they went up by the stair becaus they thought this would make a better impress they stood in a row in front of mrs darl with their hat off and wish they were not wear their pirat cloth they said noth but their eye ask her to have them they ought to have look at mr darl also but they forgot about him of cours mrs darl said at onc that she would have them but mr darl was curious depress and they saw that he consid six a rather larg number i must say he said to wendi that you dont do thing by halv a grudg remark which the twin thought was point at them the first twin was the proud one and he ask flush do you think we should be too much of a hand sir becaus if so we can go away father wendi cri shock but still the cloud was on him he knew he was behav unworthili but he could not help it we could lie doubl up said nib i alway cut their hair myself said wendi georg mrs darl exclaim pain to see her dear one show himself in such an unfavour light then he burst into tear and the truth came out he was as glad to have them as she was he said but he thought they should have ask his consent as well as her instead of treat him as a cypher zero in his own hous i dont think he is a cypher tootl cri instant do you think he is a cypher cur no i dont do you think he is a cypher slight rather not twin what do you think it turn out that not one of them thought him a cypher and he was absurd gratifi and said he would find space for them all in the draw room if they fit in well fit in sir they assur him then follow the leader he cri gaili mind you i am not sure that we have a draw room but we pretend we have and it all the same hoop la he went off danc through the hous and they all cri hoop la and danc after him search for the draw room and i forget whether they found it but at ani rate they found corner and they all fit in as for peter he saw wendi onc again befor he flew away he did not exact come to the window but he brush against it in pass so that she could open it if she like and call to him that is what she did hullo wendi good bye he said oh dear are you go away yes you dont feel peter she said falter that you would like to say anyth to my parent about a veri sweet subject no about me peter no mrs darl came to the window for at present she was keep a sharp eye on wendi she told peter that she had adopt all the other boy and would like to adopt him also would you send me to school he inquir craftili yes and then to an offic i suppos so soon i would be a man veri soon i dont want to go to school and learn solemn thing he told her passion i dont want to be a man o wendi mother if i was to wake up and feel there was a beard peter said wendi the comfort i should love you in a beard and mrs darl stretch out her arm to him but he repuls her keep back ladi no one is go to catch me and make me a man but where are you go to live with tink in the hous we built for wendi the fairi are to put it high up among the tree top where they sleep at night how love cri wendi so long that mrs darl tighten her grip i thought all the fairi were dead mrs darl said there are alway a lot of young one explain wendi who was now quit an author becaus you see when a new babi laugh for the first time a new fairi is born and as there are alway new babi there are alway new fairi they live in nest on the top of tree and the mauv one are boy and the white one are girl and the blue one are just littl silli who are not sure what they are i shall have such fun said peter with eye on wendi it will be rather lone in the even she said sit by the fire i shall have tink tink cant go a twentieth part of the way round she remind him a littl tart sneaki tell tale tink call out from somewher round the corner it doesnt matter peter said o peter you know it matter well then come with me to the littl hous may i mummi certain not i have got you home again and i mean to keep you but he doe so need a mother so do you my love oh all right peter said as if he had ask her from polit mere but mrs darl saw his mouth twitch and she made this handsom offer to let wendi go to him for a week everi year to do his spring clean wendi would have prefer a more perman arrang and it seem to her that spring would be long in come but this promis sent peter away quit gay again he had no sens of time and was so full of adventur that all i have told you about him is onli a halfpenni worth of them i suppos it was becaus wendi knew this that her last word to him were these rather plaintiv one you wont forget me peter will you befor spring clean time come of cours peter promis and then he flew away he took mrs darl kiss with him the kiss that had been for no one els peter took quit easili funni but she seem satisfi of cours all the boy went to school and most of them got into class iii but slight was put first into class iv and then into class v class i is the top class befor they had attend school a week they saw what goat they had been not to remain on the island but it was too late now and soon they settl down to be as ordinari as you or me or jenkin minor the younger jenkin it is sad to have to say that the power to fli gradual left them at first nana tie their feet to the bed post so that they should not fli away in the night and one of their divers by day was to pretend to fall off buse the english doubl decker but by and by they ceas to tug at their bond in bed and found that they hurt themselv when they let go of the bus in time they could not even fli after their hat want of practic they call it but what it realli meant was that they no longer believ michael believ longer than the other boy though they jeer at him so he was with wendi when peter came for her at the end of the first year she flew away with peter in the frock she had woven from leav and berri in the neverland and her one fear was that he might notic how short it had becom but he never notic he had so much to say about himself she had look forward to thrill talk with him about old time but new adventur had crowd the old one from his mind who is captain hook he ask with interest when she spoke of the arch enemi dont you rememb she ask amaz how you kill him and save all our live i forget them after i kill them he repli careless when she express a doubt hope that tinker bell would be glad to see her he said who is tinker bell o peter she said shock but even when she explain he could not rememb there are such a lot of them he said i expect she is no more i expect he was right for fairi dont live long but they are so littl that a short time seem a good while to them wendi was pain too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to peter it had seem such a long year of wait to her but he was exact as fascin as ever and they had a love spring clean in the littl hous on the tree top next year he did not come for her she wait in a new frock becaus the old one simpli would not meet but he never came perhap he is ill michael said you know he is never ill michael came close to her and whisper with a shiver perhap there is no such person wendi and then wendi would have cri if michael had not been cri peter came next spring clean and the strang thing was that he never knew he had miss a year that was the last time the girl wendi ever saw him for a littl longer she tri for his sake not to have grow pain and she felt she was untru to him when she got a prize for general knowledg but the year came and went without bring the careless boy and when they met again wendi was a marri woman and peter was no more to her than a littl dust in the box in which she had kept her toy wendi was grown up you need not be sorri for her she was one of the kind that like to grow up in the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other girl all the boy were grown up and done for by this time so it is scarc worth while say anyth more about them you may see the twin and nib and cur ani day go to an offic each carri a littl bag and an umbrella michael is an engin driver train engin slight marri a ladi of titl and so he becam a lord you see that judg in a wig come out at the iron door that use to be tootl the beard man who doesnt know ani stori to tell his children was onc john wendi was marri in white with a pink sash it is strang to think that peter did not alight in the church and forbid the bann formal announc of a marriag year roll on again and wendi had a daughter this ought not to be written in ink but in a golden splash she was call jane and alway had an odd inquir look as if from the moment she arriv on the mainland she want to ask question when she was old enough to ask them they were most about peter pan she love to hear of peter and wendi told her all she could rememb in the veri nurseri from which the famous flight had taken place it was jane nurseri now for her father had bought it at the three per cent mortgag rate from wendi father who was no longer fond of stair mrs darl was now dead and forgotten there were onli two bed in the nurseri now jane and her nurs and there was no kennel for nana also had pass away she die of old age and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with be veri firm convinc that no one knew how to look after children except herself onc a week jane nurs had her even off and then it was wendi part to put jane to bed that was the time for stori it was jane invent to rais the sheet over her mother head and her own thus make a tent and in the aw dark to whisper what do we see now i dont think i see anyth to night say wendi with a feel that if nana were here she would object to further convers yes you do say jane you see when you were a littl girl that is a long time ago sweetheart say wendi ah me how

this nurseri i do believ it is say jane go on they are now embark on the great adventur of the night when peter flew in look for his shadow the foolish fellow say wendi tri to stick it on with soap and when he could not he cri and that woke me and i sew it on for him you have miss a bit interrupt jane who now know the stori better than her mother when you saw him sit on the floor cri what did

mermaid lagoon and the home under the ground and the littl hous yes which did you like best of all i think i like the home under the ground best of all yes so do i what was the last thing peter ever said to you the last thing he ever said to me was just alway be wait for me and then some night you will hear me crow yes but ala he forgot all about me wendi said it with a smile she was as grown up as that what did his crow sound like jane ask one even it was like this wendi said tri to imit peter crow no it wasnt jane said grave it was like this and she did it ever so much better than her mother wendi was a littl startl my darl how can you know i often hear it when i am sleep jane said ah yes mani girl hear it when they are sleep but i was the onli one who heard it awak lucki you said

as to see to darn for there was no other light in the nurseri and while she sat darn she heard a crow then the window blew open as of old and peter drop in on the floor he was exact the same as ever
