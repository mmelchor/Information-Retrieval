earth how funni itll seem to come out among the peopl that walk with their head downward the antipathi i think she was rather glad there was no one listen this time as it didnt sound at all the right word but i shall have to ask them what the name of the countri is you know pleas maam is this new zealand or australia and she tri to curtsey as she spokef curtsey as your fall through the air do you think you could manag it and what an ignor littl girl shell think me for ask no itll never do to ask perhap i shall see it written up somewher down down down there was noth els to do so alic soon began talk again dinahl miss me veri much to night i should think dinah was the cat i hope theyll rememb her saucer of milk at tea time dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no mice in the air im afraid but you might catch a bat and that veri like a mous you know but do cat eat bat i wonder and here alic began to get rather sleepi and went on say to herself in a dreami sort of way do cat eat bat do cat eat bat and sometim do bat eat cat for you see as she couldnt answer either question it didnt much matter which way she put it she felt that she was doze off and had just begun to dream that she was walk hand in hand with dinah and say to her veri earnest now dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat when sudden thump thump down she came upon a heap of stick and dri leav and the fall was over alic was not a bit hurt and she jump up on to her feet in a moment she look up but it was all dark overhead befor her was anoth long passag and the white rabbit was still in sight hurri down it there was not a moment to be lost away went alic like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turn a corner oh my ear and whisker how late it get she was close behind it when she turn the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamp hang from the roof there were door all round the hall but they were all lock and when alic had been all the way down one side and up the other tri everi door she walk sad down the middl wonder how she was ever to get out again sudden she came upon a littl three leg tabl all made of solid glass there was noth on it except a tini golden key and alic first thought was that it might belong to one of the door of the hall but ala either the lock were too larg or the key was too small but at ani rate it would not open ani of them howev on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not notic befor and behind it was a littl door about fifteen inch high she tri the littl golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fit alic open the door and found that it led into a small passag not much larger than a rat hole she knelt down and look along the passag into the loveliest garden you ever saw how she long to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those bed of bright flower and those cool fountain but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor alic it would be of veri littl use without my shoulder oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescop i think i could if i onli knew how to begin for you see so mani out of the way thing had happen late that alic had begun to think that veri few thing inde were realli imposs there seem to be no use in wait by the littl door so she went back to the tabl half hope she might find anoth key on it or at ani rate a book of rule for shut peopl up like telescop this time she found a littl bottl on it which certain was not here befor said alic and round the neck of the bottl was a paper label with the word drink me beauti print on it in larg letter it was all veri well to say drink me but the wise littl alic was not go to do that in a hurri no ill look first she said and see whether it mark poison or not for she had read sever nice littl histori about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beast and other unpleas thing all becaus they would not rememb the simpl rule their friend had taught them such as that a red hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger veri deepli with a knife it usual bleed and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottl mark poison it is almost certain to disagre with you sooner or later howev this bottl was not mark poison so alic ventur to tast it and find it veri nice it had in fact a sort of mix flavour of cherri tart custard pine appl roast turkey toffe and hot butter toast she veri soon finish it off what a curious feel said alic i must be shut up like a telescop and so it was inde she was now onli ten inch high and her face brighten up at the thought that she was now the right size for go through the littl door into that love garden first howev she wait for a few minut to see if she was go to shrink ani further she felt a littl nervous about this for it might end you know said alic to herself in my go out altogeth like a candl i wonder what i should be like then and she tri to fanci what the flame of a candl is like after the candl is blown out for she could not rememb ever have seen such a thing after a while find that noth more happen she decid on go into the garden at onc but ala for poor alic when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the littl golden key and when she went back to the tabl for it she found she could not possibl reach it she could see it quit plain through the glass and she tri her best to climb up one of the leg of the tabl but it was too slipperi and when she had tire herself out with tri the poor littl thing sat down and cri come there no use in cri like that said alic to herself rather sharpli i advis you to leav off this minut she general gave herself veri good advic though she veri seldom follow it and sometim she scold herself so sever as to bring tear into her eye and onc she rememb tri to box her own ear for have cheat herself in a game of croquet she was play against herself for this curious child was veri fond of pretend to be two peopl but it no use now thought poor alic to pretend to be two peopl whi there hard enough of me left to make one respect person soon her eye fell on a littl glass box that was lie under the tabl she open it and found in it a veri small cake on which the word eat me were beauti mark in currant well ill eat it said alic and if it make me grow larger i can reach the key and if it make me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either way ill get into the garden and i dont care which happen she ate a littl bit and said anxious to herself which way which way hold her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was grow and she was quit surpris to find that she remain the same size to be sure this general happen when one eat cake but alic had got so much into the way of expect noth but out of the way thing to happen that it seem quit dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way so she set to work and veri soon finish off the cake chapter ii the pool of tear curious and curious cri alic she was so much surpris that for the moment she quit forgot how to speak good english now im open out like the largest telescop that ever was good bye feet for when she look down at her feet they seem to be almost out of sight they were get so far off oh my poor littl feet i wonder who

thought alic or perhap they wont walk the way i want to go let me see ill give them a new pair of boot everi christma and she went on plan to herself how she would manag it they must go by the carrier she thought and how funni itll seem send present to one own feet and how odd the direct will look alic right foot esq hearthrug near the fender with alic love oh dear what nonsens im talk just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at onc took up the littl golden key and hurri off to the garden door poor alic it was as much as she could do lie down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cri again you ought to be asham of yourself said alic a great girl like you she might well say this to go on cri in this way stop this moment i tell you but she went on all the same shed gallon of tear until there was a larg pool all round her about

said the rabbit voic and alic call out as loud as she could if you do ill set dinah at you there was a dead silenc instant and alic thought to herself i wonder what they will do next if they had ani sens theyd take the roof off after a minut or two they began move about again and alic heard the rabbit say a barrow will do to begin with a barrow of what thought alic but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of littl pebbl came rattl in at the window and some of them hit her in the face ill put a stop to this she said to herself and shout out youd better not do that again which produc anoth dead silenc alic notic with some surpris that the pebbl were all turn into littl cake as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head if i eat one of these cake she thought it sure to make some chang in my size and as it cant possibl make me larger it must make me smaller i suppos so she swallow one of the cake and was delight to find that she began shrink direct as soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the hous and found quit a crowd of littl anim and bird wait outsid the poor littl lizard bill was in the middl be held up by two guinea pig who were give it someth out of a bottl they all made a rush at alic the moment she appear but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood the first thing ive got to do said alic to herself as she wander about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that love garden i think that will be the best plan it sound an excel plan no doubt and veri neat and simpli arrang the onli difficulti was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peer about anxious among the tree a littl sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurri an enorm puppi was look down at her with larg round eye and feebli stretch out one paw tri to touch her poor littl thing said alic in a coax tone and she tri hard to whistl to it but she was terribl frighten all the time at the thought that it might be hungri in which case it would be veri like to eat her up in spite of all her coax hard know what she did she pick up a littl bit of stick and held it out to the puppi whereupon the puppi jump into the air off all it feet at onc with a yelp of delight and rush at the stick and made believ to worri it then alic dodg behind a great thistl to keep herself from be run over and the moment she appear on the other side the puppi made anoth rush at the stick and tumbl head over heel in it hurri to get hold of it then alic think it was veri like have a game of play with a cart hors and expect everi moment to be trampl under it feet ran round the thistl again then the puppi began a seri of short charg at the stick run a veri littl way forward each time and a long way back and bark hoars all the while till at last it sat down a good way off pant with it tongu hang out of it mouth and it great eye half shut this seem to alic a good opportun for make her escap so she set off at onc and ran till she was quit tire and out of breath and till the puppi bark sound quit faint in the distanc and yet what a dear littl puppi it was said alic as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fan herself with one of the leav i should have like teach it trick veri much ifif id onli been the right size to do it oh dear id near forgotten that ive got to grow up again let me seehow is it to be manag i suppos i ought to eat or drink someth or other but the great question is what the great question certain was what alic look all round her at the flower and the blade of grass but she did not see anyth that look like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumst there was a larg mushroom grow near her about the same height as herself and when she had look under it and on both side of it and behind it it occur to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it she stretch herself up on tipto and peep over the edg of the mushroom and her eye immedi met those of a larg caterpillar that was sit on the top with it arm fold quiet smoke a long hookah and take not the smallest notic of her or of anyth els chapter v advic from a caterpillar the caterpillar and alic look at each other for some time in silenc at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of

mouth and began smoke again this time alic wait patient until it chose to speak again in a minut or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of it mouth and yawn onc or twice and shook itself then it got down off the mushroom and crawl away in the grass mere remark as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter one side of what the other side of what thought alic to herself of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had ask it aloud and in anoth moment it was out of sight alic remain look thought at the mushroom for a minut tri to make out which were the two side of it and as it was perfect round she found this a veri difficult question howev at last she stretch her arm round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edg with each hand and now which is which she said to herself and nibbl a littl of the right hand bit to tri the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot she was a good deal frighten by this veri sudden chang but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrink rapid so she set to work at onc to eat some of the other bit her chin was press so close against her foot that there was hard room to open her mouth but she did it at last and manag to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit come my head free at last said alic in a tone of delight which chang into alarm in anoth moment when she found that her shoulder were nowher to be found all she could see when she look down was an immens length of neck which seem to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leav that lay far below her what can all that green stuff be said alic and where have my shoulder got to and oh my poor hand how is it i cant see you she was move them about as she spoke but no result seem to follow except a littl shake among the distant green leav as there seem to be no chanc of get her hand up to her head she tri to get her head down to them and was delight to find that her neck would bend about easili in ani direct like a serpent she had just succeed in curv it down into a grace zigzag and was go to dive in among the leav which she found to be noth but the top of the tree under which she had been wander when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurri a larg pigeon had flown into her face and was beat her violent with it wing serpent scream the pigeon im not a serpent said alic indign let me alon serpent i say again repeat the pigeon but in a more subdu tone and ad with a kind of sob ive tri everi way and noth seem to suit them i havent the least idea what your talk about said alic ive tri the root of tree and ive tri bank and ive tri hedg the pigeon went on without attend to her but those serpent there no pleas them alic was more and more puzzl but she thought there was no use in say anyth more till the pigeon had finish as if it wasnt troubl enough hatch the egg said the pigeon but i must be on the look out for serpent night and day whi i havent had a wink of sleep these three week im veri sorri youv been annoy said alic who was begin to see it mean and just as id taken the highest tree in the wood continu the pigeon rais it voic to a

it matter to me whether your a littl girl or a serpent it matter a good deal to me said alic hastili but im not look for egg as it happen and if i was i shouldnt want your i dont like them raw well be off then said the pigeon in a sulki tone as it settl down again into it nest alic crouch down among the tree as well as she could for her neck kept get entangl among the branch and everi now and then she had to stop and untwist it after a while she rememb that she still held the piec of mushroom in her hand and she set to work veri care nibbl first at one and then at the other and grow sometim taller and sometim shorter until she had succeed in bring herself down to her usual height it was so long sinc she had been anyth near the right size that it felt quit strang at first but she got use to it in a few minut and began talk to herself as usual come there half my plan done now how puzzl all these chang are im never sure what im go to be from one minut to anoth howev ive got back to my right size the next thing is to get into that beauti gardenhow is that to be done i wonder as she said this she came sudden upon an open place with a littl hous in it about four feet high whoever live there thought alic itll never do to come upon them this size whi i should frighten them out of their wit so she began nibbl at the righthand bit again and did not ventur to go near the hous till she had brought herself down to nine inch high chapter vi pig and pepper for a minut or two she stood look at the hous and wonder what to do next when sudden a footman in liveri came run out of the woodsh consid him to be a footman becaus he was in liveri otherwis judg by his face onli she would have call him a fishand rap loud at the door with his knuckl it was open by anoth footman in liveri with a round face and larg eye like a frog and both footmen alic notic had powder hair that curl all over their head she felt veri curious to know what it was all about and crept a littl way out of the wood to listen the fish footman began by produc from under his arm a great letter near as larg as himself and this he hand over to the other say in a solemn tone for the duchess an invit from the queen to play croquet the frog footman repeat in the same solemn tone onli chang the order of the word a littl from the queen an invit for the duchess to play croquet then they both bow low and their curl got entangl togeth alic laugh so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hear her and when she next peep out the fish footman was gone and the other was sit on the ground near the door stare stupid up into the sky alic went timid up to the door and knock there no sort of use in knock said the footman and that for two reason first becaus im on the same side of the door as you are second becaus theyr make such a nois insid no one could possibl hear you and certain there was a most extraordinari nois go on withina constant howl and sneez and everi now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettl had been broken to piec pleas then said alic how am i to get in there might be some sens in your knock the footman went on without attend to her if we had the door between us for instanc if you were insid you might knock and i could let you out you know he was look up into the sky all the time he was speak and this alic thought decid uncivil but perhap he cant help it she said to herself his eye are so veri near at the top of his head but at ani rate he might answer questionshow am i to get in she repeat aloud i shall sit here the footman remark till tomorrow at this moment the door of the hous open and a larg plate came skim out straight at the footman head it just graze his nose and broke to piec against one of the tree behind him or next day mayb the footman continu in the same tone exact as if noth had happen how am i to get in ask alic again in a louder tone are you to get in at all said the footman that the first question you know it was no doubt onli alic did not like to be told so it realli dread she mutter to herself the way all the creatur argu it enough to drive one crazi the footman seem to think this a good opportun for repeat his remark with variat i shall sit here he said on and off for day and day but what am i to do said alic anyth you like said the footman and began whistl oh there no use in talk to him said alic desper hes perfect idiot and she open the door and went in the door led right into a larg kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the duchess was sit on a three leg stool in the middl nurs a babi the cook was lean over the fire stir a larg cauldron which seem to be full of soup there certain too much pepper in that soup alic said to herself as well as she could for sneez there was certain too much of it in the air even the duchess sneez occasion and as for the babi it was sneez and howl altern without a moment paus the onli thing in the kitchen that did not sneez were the cook and a larg cat which was sit on the hearth and grin from ear to ear pleas would you tell me said alic a littl timid for she was not quit sure whether it was good manner for her to speak first whi your cat grin like that it a cheshir cat said the duchess and that whi pig she said the last word with such sudden violenc that alic quit jump but she saw in anoth moment that it was address to the babi and not to her so she took courag and went on again i didnt know that cheshir cat alway grin in fact i didnt know that cat could grin they all can said the duchess and most of em do i dont know of ani that do alic said veri polit feel quit pleas to have got into a convers you dont know much said the duchess and that a fact alic did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduc some other subject of convers while she was tri to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at onc set to work throw everyth within her reach at the duchess and the babyth fire iron came first then follow a shower of saucepan plate and dish the duchess took no notic of them even when they hit her and the babi was howl so much alreadi that it was quit imposs to say whether the blow hurt it or not oh pleas mind what your do cri alic jump up and down in an agoni of terror oh there goe his precious nose as an unusu larg saucepan flew close by it and veri near carri it off if everybodi mind their own busi the duchess said in a hoars growl the world would go round a deal faster than it doe which would not be an advantag said alic who felt veri glad to get an opportun of show off a littl of her knowledg just think of what work it would make with the day and night you see the earth take twenti four hour to turn round on it axi talk of axe said the duchess chop off her head alic glanc rather anxious at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was busili stir the soup and seem not to be listen so she went on again twenti four hour i think or is it twelv i oh dont bother me said the duchess i never could abid figur and with that she began nurs her child again sing a sort of lullabi to it as she did so and give it a violent shake at the end of everi line speak rough to your littl boy and beat him when he sneez he onli doe it to annoy becaus he know it teas chorus in which the cook and the babi join wow wow wow while the duchess sang the second vers of the song she kept toss the babi violent up and down and the poor littl thing howl so that alic could hard hear the word i speak sever to my boy i beat him when he sneez for he can thorough enjoy the pepper when he pleas chorus wow wow wow here you may nurs it a bit if you like the duchess said to alic fling the babi at her as she spoke i must go and get readi to play croquet with the queen and she hurri out of the room the cook threw a fri pan after her as she went out but it just miss her alic caught the babi with some difficulti as it was a queer shape littl creatur and held out it arm and leg in all direct just like a star fish thought alic the poor littl thing was snort like a steam engin when she caught it and kept doubl itself up and straighten itself out again so that altogeth for the first minut or two it was as much as she could do to hold it as soon as she had made out the proper way of nurs it which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of it right ear and left foot so as to prevent it undo itself she carri it out into the open air if i dont take this child away with me thought alic theyr sure to kill it in a day or two wouldnt it be murder to leav it behind she said the last word out loud and the littl thing grunt in repli it had left off sneez by this time dont grunt said alic that not at all a proper way of express yourself the babi grunt again and alic look veri anxious into it face to see what was the matter with it there could be no doubt that it had a veri turn up nose much more like a snout than a real nose also it eye were get extrem small for a babi altogeth alic did not like the look of the thing at all but perhap it was onli sob she thought and look into it eye again to see if there were ani tear no there were no tear if your go to turn into a pig my dear said alic serious ill have noth more to do with you mind now the poor littl thing sob again or grunt it was imposs to say which and they went on for some while in silenc alic was just begin to think to herself now what am i to do with this creatur when i get it home when it grunt again so violent that she look down into it face in some alarm this time there could be no mistak about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quit absurd for her to carri it further so she set the littl creatur down and felt quit reliev to see it trot away quiet into the wood if it had grown up she said to herself it would have made a dread ugli child but it make rather a handsom pig i think and she began think over other children she knew who might do veri well as pig and was just say to herself if one onli knew the right way to chang them when she was a littl startl by see the cheshir cat sit on a bough of a tree a few yard off the cat onli grin when it saw alic it look good natur she thought still it had veri long claw and a great mani teeth so she felt that it ought to be treat with respect cheshir puss she began rather timid as she did not at all know whether it would like the name howev it onli grin a littl wider come it pleas so far thought alic and she went on would you tell me pleas which way i ought to go from here that depend a good deal on where you want to get to said the cat i dont much care where said alic then it doesnt matter which way you go said the cat so long as i get somewher alic ad as an explan oh your sure to do that said the cat if you onli walk long enough alic felt that this could not be deni so she tri anoth question what sort of peopl live about here in that direct the cat said wave it right paw round live a hatter and in that direct wave the other paw live a march hare visit either you like theyr both mad but i dont want to go among mad peopl alic remark oh you cant help that said the cat were all mad here im mad your mad how do you know im mad said alic you must be said the cat or you wouldnt have come here alic didnt think that prove it at all howev she went on and how do you know that your mad to begin with said the cat a dog not mad you grant that i suppos so said alic well then the cat went on you see a dog growl when it angri and wag it tail when it pleas now i growl when im pleas and wag my tail when im angri therefor im mad i call it pur not growl said alic call it what you like said the cat do you play croquet with the queen to day i should like it veri much said alic but i havent been invit yet youll see me there said the cat and vanish alic was not much surpris at this she was get so use to queer thing happen while she was look at the place where it had been it sudden appear again by the bye what becam of the babi said the cat id near forgotten to ask it turn into a pig alic quiet said just as if it had come back in a natur way i thought it would said the cat and vanish again alic wait a littl half expect to see it again but it did not appear and after a minut or two she walk on in the direct in which the march hare was said to live ive seen hatter befor she said to herself the march hare will be much the most interest and perhap as this is may it wont be rave madat least not so mad as it was in march as she said this she look up and there was the cat again sit on a branch of a tree did you say pig or fig said the cat i said pig repli alic and i wish you wouldnt keep appear and vanish so sudden you make one quit giddi all right said the cat and this time it vanish quit slowli begin with the end of the tail and end with the grin which remain some time after the rest of it had gone well ive often seen a cat without a grin thought alic but a grin without a cat it the most curious thing i ever saw in my life she had not gone much farther befor she came in sight of the hous of the march hare she thought it must be the right hous becaus the chimney were shape like ear and the roof was thatch with fur it was so larg a hous that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbl some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and rais herself to about two feet high even then she walk up toward it rather timid say to herself suppos it should be rave mad after all i almost wish id gone to see

will hear you you see she came rather late and the queen said get to your place shout the queen in a voic of thunder and peopl began run about in all direct tumbl up against each other howev they got settl down in a minut or two and the game began alic thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life it was all ridg and furrow the ball were live hedgehog the mallet live flamingo and the soldier had to doubl themselv up and to stand on their hand and feet to make the arch the chief difficulti alic found at first was in manag her flamingo she succeed in get it bodi tuck away comfort enough under her arm with it leg hang down but general just as she had got it neck nice straighten out and was go to give the hedgehog a blow with it head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzl express that she could not help burst out laugh and when she had got it head down and was go to begin again it was veri provok to find that the hedgehog had unrol itself and was in the act of crawl away besid all this there was general a ridg or furrow in the way wherev she want to send the hedgehog to and as the doubl up soldier were alway get up and walk off to other part of the ground alic soon came to the conclus that it was a veri difficult game inde the player all play at onc without wait for turn quarrel all the while and fight for the hedgehog and in a veri short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamp about and shout off with his head or off with her head about onc in a minut alic began to feel veri uneasi to be sure she had not as yet had ani disput with the queen but she knew that it might happen ani minut and then thought she what would becom of me theyr dread fond of behead peopl here the great wonder is that there ani one left aliv she was look about for some way of escap and wonder whether she could get away without be seen when she notic a curious appear in the air it puzzl her veri much at first but after watch it a minut or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself it the cheshir cat now i shall have somebodi to talk to how are you get on said the cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with alic wait till the eye appear and then nod it no use speak to it she thought till it ear have come or at least one of them in anoth minut the whole head appear and then alic put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feel veri glad she had someon to listen to her the cat seem to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appear i dont think they play at all fair alic began in rather a complain tone and they all quarrel so dread one cant hear oneself speakand they dont seem to have ani rule in particular at least if there are nobodi attend to themand youv no idea how confus it is all the thing be aliv for instanc there the arch ive got to go through next walk about at the other end of the groundand i should have croquet the queen hedgehog just now onli it ran away when it saw mine come how do you like the queen said the cat in a low voic not at all said alic shes so extrem just then she notic that the queen was close behind her listen so she went on like to win that it hard worth while finish the game the queen smile and pass on who are you talk to said the king go up to alic and look at the cat head with great curios it a friend of minea cheshir cat said alic allow me to introduc it i dont like the look of it at all said the king howev it may kiss my hand if it like id rather not the cat remark dont be impertin said the king and dont look at me like that he got behind alic as he spoke a cat may look at a king said alic ive read that in some book but i dont rememb where well it must be remov said the king veri decid and he call the queen who was pass at the moment my dear i wish you would have this cat remov the queen had onli one way of settl all difficulti great or small off with his head she said without even look round ill fetch the execution myself said the king eager and he hurri off alic thought she might as well go back and see how the game was go on as she heard the queen voic in the distanc scream with passion she had alreadi heard her sentenc three of the player to be execut for have miss their turn and she did not like the look of thing at all as the game was in such confus that she never knew whether it was her turn or not so she went in search of her hedgehog the hedgehog was engag in a fight with anoth hedgehog which seem to alic an excel opportun for croquet one of them with the other the onli difficulti was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where alic could see it tri in a helpless sort of way to fli up into a tree by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehog were out of sight but it doesnt matter much thought alic as all the arch are gone from this side of the ground so she tuck it away under her arm that it might not escap again and went back for a littl more convers with her friend when she got back to the cheshir cat she was surpris to find quit a larg crowd collect round it there was a disput go on between the execution the king and the queen who were all talk at onc while all the rest were quit silent and look veri uncomfort the moment alic appear she was appeal to by all three to settl the question and they repeat their argument to her though as they all spoke at onc she found it veri hard inde to make out exact what they said the execution argument was that you couldnt cut off a head unless there was a bodi to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing befor and he wasnt go to begin at his time of life the king argument was that anyth that had a head could be behead and that you werent to talk nonsens the queen argument was that if someth wasnt done about it in less than no time shed have everybodi execut all round it was this last remark that had made the whole parti look so grave and anxious alic could think of noth els to say but it belong to the duchess youd better ask her about it shes in prison the queen said to the execution fetch her here and the execution went off like an arrow the cat head began fade away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the duchess it had entir disappear so the king and the execution ran wild up and down look for it while the rest of the parti went back to the game chapter ix the mock turtl stori you cant think how glad i am to see you again you dear old thing said the duchess as she tuck her arm affection into alic and they walk off togeth alic was veri glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhap it was onli the pepper that had made her so savag when they met in the kitchen when im a duchess she said to herself not in a veri hope tone though i wont have ani pepper in my kitchen at all soup doe veri well withoutmayb it alway pepper that make peopl hot temper she went on veri much pleas at have found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that make them sourand camomil that make them bitterandand barley sugar and such thing that make children sweet temper i onli wish peopl knew that then they wouldnt be so stingi about it you know she had quit forgotten the duchess by this time and was a littl startl when she heard her voic close to her ear your think about someth my dear and that make you forget to talk i cant tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall rememb it in a bit perhap it hasnt one alic ventur to remark tut tut child said the duchess everyth got a moral if onli you can find it and she squeez herself up closer to alic side as she spoke alic did not much like keep so close to her first becaus the duchess was veri ugli and second becaus she was exact the right height to rest her chin upon alic shoulder and it was an uncomfort sharp chin howev she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could the game go on rather better now she said by way of keep up the convers a littl tis so said the duchess and the moral of that isoh tis love tis love that make the world go round somebodi said alic whisper that it done by everybodi mind their own busi ah well it mean much the same thing said the duchess dig her sharp littl chin into alic shoulder as she ad and the moral of that istak care of the sens and the sound will take care of themselv how fond she is of find moral in thing alic thought to herself i dare say your wonder whi i dont put my arm round your waist the duchess said after a paus the reason is that im doubt about the temper of your flamingo shall i tri the experi he might bite alic cautious repli not feel at all anxious to have the experi tri veri true said the duchess flamingo and mustard both bite and the moral of that isbird of a feather flock togeth onli mustard isnt a bird alic remark right as usual said the duchess what a clear way you have of put thing it a miner i think said alic of cours it is said the duchess who seem readi to agre to everyth that alic said there a larg mustard mine near here and the moral of that isth more there is of mine the less there is of your oh i know exclaim alic who had not attend to this last remark it a veget it doesnt look like one but it is i quit agre with you said the duchess and the moral of that isb what you would seem to beor if youd like it put more simplynev imagin yourself not to be otherwis than what it might appear to other that what you were or might have been was not otherwis than what you had been would have appear to them to be otherwis i think i should understand that better alic said veri polit if i had it written down but i cant quit follow it as you say it that noth to what i could say if i chose the duchess repli in a pleas tone pray dont troubl yourself to say it ani longer than that said alic oh dont talk about troubl said the duchess i make you a present of everyth ive said as yet a cheap sort of present thought alic im glad they dont give birthday present like that but she did not ventur to say it out loud think again the duchess ask with anoth dig of her sharp littl chin ive a right to think said alic sharpli for she was begin to feel a littl worri just about as much right said the duchess as pig have to fli and the m but here to alic great surpris the duchesss voic die away even in the middl of her favourit word moral and the arm that was link into her began to trembl alic look up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arm fold frown like a thunderstorm a fine day your majesti the duchess began in a low weak voic now i give you fair warn shout the queen stamp on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time take your choic the duchess took her choic and was gone in a moment let go on with the game the queen said to alic and alic was too much frighten to say a word but slowli follow her back to the croquet ground the other guest had taken advantag of the queen absenc and were rest in the shade howev the moment they saw her they hurri back to the game the queen mere remark that a moment delay would cost them their live all the time they were play the queen never left off quarrel with the other player and shout off with his head or off with her head those whom she sentenc were taken into custodi by the soldier who of cours had to leav off be arch to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arch left and all the player except the king the queen and alic were in custodi and under sentenc of execut then the queen left off quit out of breath and said to alic have you seen the mock turtl yet no said alic i dont even know what a mock turtl is it the thing mock turtl soup is made from said the queen i never saw one or heard of one said alic come on then said the queen and he shall tell you his histori as they

moment how larg she had grown in the last few minut and she jump up in such a hurri that she tip over the juri box with the edg of her skirt upset all the jurymen on to the head of the crowd below and there they lay sprawl about remind her veri much of a globe of goldfish she had accident upset the week befor oh i beg your pardon she exclaim in a tone of great dismay and began pick them up again as quick as she could for the accid of the goldfish kept run in her head and she had a vagu sort of idea that they must be collect at onc and put back into the juri box or they would die the trial cannot proceed said the king in a veri grave voic until all the jurymen are back in their proper placesal he repeat with great emphasi look hard at alic as he said do alic look at the juri box and saw that in her hast she had put the lizard in head downward and the poor littl thing was wave it tail about in a melancholi way be quit unabl to move she soon got it out again and put it right not that it signifi much she said to herself i should think it would be quit as much use in the trial one way up as the other as soon as the juri had a littl recov from the shock of be upset and their slate and pencil had been found and hand back to them they set to work veri dilig to write out a histori of the accid all except the lizard who seem too much overcom to do anyth but sit with it mouth open gaze up into the roof of the court what do you know about this busi the king said to alic noth said alic noth whatev persist the king noth whatev said alic that veri import the king said turn to the juri

it to be true if she should push the matter on what would becom of you i gave her one they gave him two you gave us three or more they all return from him to you though they were mine befor if i or she should chanc to be involv in this affair he trust to you to set them free exact as we were my notion was that you had been befor she had this fit an obstacl that came between him and ourselv and it dont let him know she like them best for this must ever be a secret kept from all the rest between yourself and me that the most import piec of evid weve heard yet said the king rub his hand so now
