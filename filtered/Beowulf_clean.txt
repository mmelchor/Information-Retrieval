vers would to a larg extent be prose to a modern ear the heyn socin text and glossari have been close follow occasion a deviat has been made but alway for what seem good and suffici reason the translat doe not aim to be an editor onc in a while howev he has ad a conjectur of his own to the emend quot from the critic of other student of the poem this work is address to two class of reader from both of these alik the translat beg sympathi and co oper the anglo saxon scholar he hope to pleas by adher faith to the origin the student of english literatur he aim to interest by give him in modern garb the most ancient epic of our race this is a bold and venturesom undertak and yet there must be some student of the teuton past will to follow even a dare guid if they may read in modern phrase of the sorrow of hrothgar of the prowess of beowulf and of the feel that stir the heart of our forefath in their primev home in order to pleas the larger class of reader a regular cadenc has been use a measur which while retain the essenti characterist of the origin permit the reader to see ahead of him in read perhap everi anglo saxon scholar has his own theori as to how beowulf should be translat some have given us prose version of what we believ to be a great poem is it ani reflect on our honor kembl and arnold to say that their translat fail to show a layman that beowulf is just call our first epic of those translat who have use vers sever have written from what would seem a mistaken point of view is it proper for instanc that the grave and solemn speech of beowulf and hrothgar be put in ballad measur trip light and airili along or again is it fit that the rough martial music of anglo saxon vers be interpret to us in the smooth measur of modern blank vers do we hear what has been beauti call the clang tread of a warrior in mail viii of all english translat of beowulf that of professor garnett alon give ani adequ idea of the chief characterist of this great teuton epic the measur use in the present translat is believ to be as near a reproduct of the origin as modern english afford the cadenc close resembl those use by brown in some of his most strike poem the four stress of the anglo saxon vers are retain and as much thesi and anacrusi is allow as is consist with a regular cadenc alliter has been use to a larg extent but it was thought that modern ear would hard toler it on everi line end rhyme has been use occasion intern rhyme sporad both have some warrant in anglo saxon poetri for end rhyme see 1 53 1 54 for intern rhyme 2 21 6 40 what gummere1 call the rime giver has been studious kept viz the first accent syllabl in the second half vers alway carri the alliter and the last accent syllabl alliter onli sporad altern alliter is occasion use as in the origin see 7 61 8 5 no two accent syllabl have been brought togeth except occasion after a caesur paus see 2 19 and 12 1 or scientif speak sieverss c type has been avoid as not conson with the plan of translat sever of his type howev constant occur eg a and a variant / x / x / x x / x b and a variant x / x /  x x / x /  a variant of d / x / x x e / x x /  anacrusi give further varieti to the type use in the translat the parallel of the origin have been faith preserv eg 1 16 and 1 17 lord and wielder of glori 1 30 1 31 1 32 2 12 and 2 13 2 27 and 2 28 3 5 and 3 6 occasion some loss has been sustain but on the other hand a gain has here and there been made the effort has been made to give a decid flavor of archaism to the translat all word not in keep with the spirit of the poem have been avoid again though mani archaic word have been use there are none it is believ which are not found in standard modern poetri ix with these preliminari remark it will not be amiss to give an
