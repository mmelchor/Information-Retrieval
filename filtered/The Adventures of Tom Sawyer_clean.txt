whisper of the choir in the galleri the choir alway titter and whisper all through servic there was onc a church choir that was not ill bred but i have forgotten where it was now it was a great mani year ago and i can scarc rememb anyth about it but i think it was in some foreign countri the minist gave out the hymn and read it through with a relish in a peculiar style which was much admir in that part of the countri his voic began on a medium key and climb steadili up till it reach a certain point where it bore with strong emphasi upon the topmost word and then plung down as if from a

through it he kept talli of the detail of the prayer unconsciouslyfor he was not listen but he knew the ground of old and the clergyman regular rout over itand when a littl trifl of new matter was interlard his ear detect it and his whole natur resent it he consid addit unfair and scoundrelli in the midst of the prayer a fli had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortur his spirit by calm rub it hand togeth embrac it head with it arm and polish it so vigor that it seem to almost part compani with the bodi and the slender thread of a neck was expos to view scrape it wing with it

they did not dareh believ his soul would be instant destroy if he did such a thing while the prayer was go on but with the close sentenc his hand began to curv and steal forward and the instant the amen was out the fli was a prison of war his aunt detect the act and made him let it go the minist gave out his text and drone along monoton through an argument that was so prosi that mani a head by

went stealthili thither and help themselv to a chunk they made an impos adventur of it say hist everi now and then and sudden halt with finger on lip move with hand on imaginari dagger hilt and give order in dismal whisper that if the foe stir to let him have it to the hilt becaus dead men tell no tale they knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the villag lay in store or have a

his former joy and his later suffer and wish she could see him now abroad on the wild sea face peril and death with dauntless heart go to his doom with a grim smile on his lip it was but a small strain on his imagin to remov jackson island beyond eye shot of the villag and so he look his last with a broken and satisfi heart the other pirat were look their last too and they all look so long that they came near let the current drift them out of the rang of the island but they discov the danger in time and made shift to avert it about two oclock in the morn the raft ground on the bar two

him understand that his poor rag would do to begin with though it was customari for wealthi pirat to start with a proper wardrob gradual their talk die out and drowsi began to steal upon the eyelid of the littl waif the pipe drop from the finger of the red hand and he slept the sleep of the conscienc free and the weari the terror of the sea and the black aveng of the spanish main had more difficulti in get to sleep they said their prayer inward and lie down sinc there was nobodi there with author to make them kneel and recit aloud in truth they had a mind not to say them at all but they were afraid to proceed to such length as that lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven then at onc they reach and hover upon the immin verg of sleepbut an intrud came now that would not down it was conscienc they began to feel a vagu fear that they had been do wrong to run away and next they thought of the stolen meat and then the real tortur came they tri to argu it away by remind conscienc that they had purloin sweetmeat and appl score of time but conscienc was not to be appeas by such thin plausibl it seem to them in the end that there was no get around the stubborn fact that take sweetmeat was onli hook while take bacon and ham and such valuabl was plain simpl stealingand there was a command against that in the bibl so they inward resolv that so long as they remain in the busi their piraci should not again be sulli with the crime of steal then conscienc grant a truce and these curious inconsist pirat fell peac to sleep chapter xiv when tom awok in the morn he wonder where he was he sat up and rub his eye and look around then he comprehend it was the cool gray dawn and there was a delici sens of repos and peac in the deep pervad calm and silenc of the wood not a leaf stir not a sound obtrud upon great natur medit bead dewdrop stood upon the leav and grass a white layer of ash cover the fire and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air joe and huck still slept now far away in the wood a bird call anoth answer present the hammer of a woodpeck was heard gradual the cool dim gray of the morn whiten and as gradual

the air from time to time and snif around then proceed againfor he was measur tom said and when the worm approach him of it own accord he sat as still as a stone with his hope rise and fall by turn as the creatur still came toward him or seem inclin to go elsewher and when at last it consid a pain moment with it curv bodi in the air and then came decis down upon tom leg and began a journey over him his whole heart was gladfor that meant that he was go to have a new suit of clotheswithout the shadow of a doubt a gaudi pirat uniform now a process of ant appear from nowher in particular and went about their labor one struggl man by with a dead spider five time as big as itself in it arm and lug it straight up a tree trunk a brown spot ladi bug climb the dizzi height of a grass blade and tom bent down close to it and said ladi bug ladi bug fli away home your hous is on fire your children alon and she took wing and went off to see about itwhich did not surpris the boy for he knew of old that this insect was credul about conflagr and he had practis upon it simplic more than onc a tumblebug came next heav sturdili at it ball and tom touch the creatur to see it shut it leg against it bodi and pretend to be dead the bird were fair riot by this time a catbird the northern mocker lit in a tree over tom head and trill out her imit of her neighbor in a raptur of enjoy then a shrill jay swept down a flash of blue flame and stop on a twig almost within the boy reach cock his head to one side and eye the stranger with a consum curios a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the fox kind came skurri along sit up at interv to inspect and chatter at the boy for the wild thing had probabl never seen a human be befor and scarc knew whether to be afraid or not all natur was wide awak and stir now long lanc of sunlight pierc down through the dens foliag far and near and a few butterfli came flutter upon the scene tom stir up the other pirat and they all clatter away with a shout and in a minut or two were strip and chase after and tumbl over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar they felt no long for the littl villag sleep in the distanc beyond the majest wast of water a vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carri off their raft but this onli gratifi them sinc it go was someth like burn the bridg between them and civil they came back to camp wonder refresh glad heart and raven and they soon had the camp fire blaze up again huck found a spring of clear cold water close by and the boy made cup of broad oak or hickori leav and felt that water sweeten with such a wildwood charm as that would be a good enough substitut for coffe while joe was slice bacon for breakfast tom and huck ask him to hold on a minut they step to a promis nook in the river bank and threw in their line almost immedi they had reward joe had not had time to get impati befor they were back again with some handsom bass a coupl of sun perch and a small catfishprovis enough for quit a famili they fri the fish with the bacon and were astonish for no fish had ever seem so delici befor they did not know that the quicker a fresh water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he is and they reflect littl upon what a sauc open air sleep open air exercis bath and a larg ingredi of hunger make too they lay around in the shade after breakfast while huck had a smoke and then went off through the wood on an explor expedit they tramp gayli along over decay log through tangl underbrush among solemn monarch of the forest hung from their crown to the ground with a droop regalia of grape vine now and then they came upon snug nook carpet with grass and jewel with flower they found plenti of thing to be delight with but noth to be astonish at they discov that the island was about three mile long and a quarter of a mile wide and that the shore it lay closest to was onli separ from it by a narrow channel hard two hundr yard wide they took a swim about everi hour so it was close upon the middl of the afternoon when they got back to camp they were too hungri to stop to fish but they fare sumptuous upon cold ham and then threw themselv down in the shade to talk but the talk soon began to drag and then die the still the solemn that brood in the wood and the sens of loneli began to tell upon the spirit of the boy they fell to think a sort of undefin long crept upon them this took dim shape presentlyit was bud homesick even finn the red hand was dream of his doorstep and empti hogshead but they were all asham of their weak and none was brave enough to speak his thought for some time now the boy had been dulli conscious of a peculiar sound in the distanc just as one sometim is of the tick of a clock which he take no distinct note of but now this mysteri sound becam more pronounc and forc a recognit the boy start glanc at each other and then each assum a listen attitud there was a long silenc profound and unbroken then a deep sullen boom came float down out of the distanc what is it exclaim joe under his breath i wonder said tom in a whisper taint thunder said huckleberri in an awe tone becuz thunder hark said tom listendont talk they wait a time that seem an age and then the same muffl boom troubl the solemn hush let go and see they sprang to their feet and hurri to the shore toward the town they part the bush on the bank and peer out over the water the littl steam ferri boat was about a mile below the villag drift with the current her broad deck seem crowd with peopl there were a great mani skiff row about or float with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferryboat but the boy could not determin what the men in them were do present a great jet of white smoke burst from the ferryboat side and as it expand and rose in a lazi cloud that same dull throb of sound was born to the listen again i know now exclaim tom somebodi drownd that it said huck they done that last summer when bill turner got drownd they shoot a cannon over the water and that make him come up to the top yes and they take loav of bread and put quicksilv in em and set em afloat and wherev there anybodi that drownd theyll float right there and stop yes ive heard about that said joe i wonder what make the bread do that oh it aint the bread so much said tom i reckon it most what they say over it befor they start it out but they dont say anyth over it said huck ive seen em and they dont well that funni said tom but mayb they say it to themselv of cours they do anybodi might know that the other boy agre that there was reason in what tom said becaus an ignor lump of bread uninstruct by an incant could not be expect to act veri intellig when set upon an errand of such graviti by jing i wish i was over there now said joe i do too said huck id give heap to know who it is the boy still listen and watch present a reveal thought flash through tom mind and he exclaim boy i know whos drowndedit us they felt like hero in an instant here was a gorgeous triumph they were miss they were mourn heart were break on their account tear were be shed accus memori of unkind to these poor lost lad were rise up and unavail regret and remors were be indulg and best of all the depart were the talk of the whole town and the envi of all the boy as far as this dazzl notorieti was concern this was fine it was worth while to be a pirat after all as twilight drew on the ferryboat went back to her accustom busi and the skiff disappear the pirat return to camp they were jubil with vaniti over their new grandeur and the illustri troubl they were make they caught fish cook supper and ate it and then fell to guess at what the villag was think and say about them and the pictur they drew of the public distress on their account were gratifi to look uponfrom their point of view but when the shadow of night close them in they gradual ceas to talk and sat gaze into the fire with their mind evid wander elsewher the excit was gone now and tom and joe could not keep back thought of certain person at home who were not enjoy this fine frolic as much as they were misgiv came they grew troubl and unhappi a sigh or two escap

his knife halt a moment undecid and then turn toward the stairway the boy thought of the closet but their strength was gone the step came creak up the stairsth intoler distress of the situat woke the stricken resolut of the ladsthey were about to spring for the closet when there was a crash of rotten timber and injun joe land on the ground amid the debri of the ruin stairway he gather himself up

joe grumbl awhil then he agre with his friend that what daylight was left ought to be econom in get thing readi for leav short afterward they slip out of the hous in the deepen twilight and move toward the river with their precious box tom and huck rose up weak but vast reliev and stare after them through the chink between the log of the hous follow not they they were content to reach ground again without broken neck and take the townward track over the hill they did not talk much they were too much absorb in hate themselvesh the ill luck that made them take the spade and the pick there but for that injun joe never would have suspect he would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait there till his reveng was satisfi and then he would have had the misfortun to find that money turn up miss bitter bitter luck that the tool were ever brought there they resolv to keep a lookout for that spaniard when he should come to town spi out for chanc to do his reveng job and follow him to number two wherev that might be then a ghast thought occur to tom reveng what if he mean us huck oh dont said huck near faint they talk it all over and as they enter town they agre to believ that he might possibl mean somebodi elseat least that he might at least mean nobodi but tom sinc onli tom had testifi veri veri small comfort it was to tom to be alon in danger compani would be a palpabl improv he thought chapter xxvii the adventur of the day mightili torment tom dream that night four time he had his hand on that rich treasur and four time it wast to nothing in his finger as sleep forsook him and wake brought back the hard realiti of his misfortun as he lay in the earli morn recal the incid of his great adventur he notic that they seem curious subdu and far awaysomewhat as if they had happen in anoth world or in a time long gone by then it occur to him that the great adventur itself must be a dream there was one veri strong argument in favor of this ideanam that the quantiti of coin he had seen was too vast to be real he had never seen as much as fifti dollar in one mass befor and he was like all boy of his age and station in life in that he imagin that all refer to hundr and thousand were mere fanci form of speech and that no such sum realli exist in the world he never had suppos for a moment that so larg a sum as a hundr dollar was to be found in actual money in ani one possess if his notion of hidden treasur had been analyz they would have been found to consist of a hand of real dime and a bushel of vagu splendid ungrasp dollar but the incid of his adventur grew sensibl sharper and clearer under the attrit of think them over and so he present found himself lean to the impress that the thing might not have been a dream after all this uncertainti must be swept away he would snatch a hurri breakfast and go and find huck huck was sit on the gunwal of a flatboat listless dangl his feet in the water and look veri melancholi tom conclud to let huck lead up to the subject if he did not do it then the adventur would be prove to have been onli a dream hello huck hello yourself silenc for a minut tom if wed a left the blame tool at the dead tree wed a got the money oh aint it aw taint a dream then taint a dream somehow i most wish it was dogd if i dont huck what aint a dream oh that thing yesterday i been half think it was dream if them stair
