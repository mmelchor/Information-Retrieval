never was none so hard as was that woman birth then she set it all forth to him for becaus she knew the man that time was had live nigh that hous the man hearken to her word for he felt with wonder women woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wonder to look on her face that was a fair face for ani man to see but yet was she left after long year a handmaid nine twelv bloodflow chide her childless and while they spake the door of the castl was open and there nigh them a mickl nois as of mani that sat there at meat and there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept dixon and the travel leopold was couth to him sithen it had hap that they had had ado each with other in the hous of misericord where this learningknight lay by caus the travel leopold came there to be heal for he was sore wound in his breast by a spear wherewith a horribl and dread dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salv of volatil salt and chrism as much as he might suffic and he said now that he should go in to that castl for to make merri with them that were there and the travel leopold said that he should go otherwhith for he was a man of cautel and a subtil also the ladi was of his avi and reprev the learningknight though she trow well that the travel had said thing that was fals for his subtil but the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrari to his list and he said how it was a marvel castl and the travel leopold went into the castl for to rest him for a space be sore of limb after mani march environ in diver land and sometim veneri and in the castl was set a board that was of the birchwood of finlandi and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that countri but they durst not move more for enchant and on this board were fright sword and knive that are made in a great cavern by swink demon out of white flame that they fix then in the horn of buffalo and stag that there abound marvel and there were vessel that are wrought by magic of mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blase in to them like to bubbl and full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devis a fuller ne richer and there was a vat of silver that was move by craft to open in the which lay strang fish withouten head though misbeliev men nie that this be possibl thing without they see it natheless they are so and these fish lie in an oili water brought there from portug land becaus of the fat that therein is like to the juic of the olivepress and also it was a marvel to see in that castl how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidney out of chalde that by aid of certain angri spirit that they do in to it swell up wondrous like to a vast mountain and they teach the serpent there to entwin themselv up on long stick out of the ground and of the scale of these serpent they brew out a brewag like to mead and the learn knight let pour for child leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank everi each and child leopold did up his beaver for to pleasur him and took apert somewhat in amiti for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privili he void the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile and he sat down in that castl with them for to rest him there awhil thank be almighti god this meanwhil this good sister stood by the door and beg them at the rever of jesu our alther lieg lord to leav their wassail for there was abov one quick with child a gentl dame whose time hie fast sir leopold heard on the upfloor cri on high and he wonder what cri that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel said he that it be not come or now meseem it dureth overlong and he was ware and saw a franklin that hight lenehan on that side the tabl that was older than ani of the tother and for that they both were knight virtuous in the one empris and eke by caus that he was elder he spoke to him full gentl but said he or it be long too she will bring forth by god his bounti and have joy of her child for she hath wait marvel long and the franklin that had drunken said expect each moment to be her next also he took the cup that stood tofor him for him need never none ask nor desir of him to drink and now drink said he fulli delect and he quaf as far as he might to their both health for he was a pass good man of his lusti and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholar hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husband hand under hen and that was the veri truest knight of the world one that ever did minion servic to ladi gentl pledg him court in the cup woman woe with wonder ponder now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might there was a sort of scholar along either side the board that is to wit dixon yclept junior of saint mari merciabl with other his fellow lynch and madden scholar of medicin and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa one crotther and young stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and costello that men clepen punch costello all long of a masteri of him erewhil gest and of all them reserv young stephen he was the most drunken that demand still of more mead and besid the meek sir leopold but on young malachi they wait for that he promis to have come and such as intend to no good said how he had broke his avow and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that his languor becalm him there after longest wander insomuch as they feast him for that time in the honourablest manner ruth red him love led on with will to wander loth to leav for they were right witti scholar and he heard their aresoun each gen other as touch birth and righteous young madden maintain that put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agon with a woman of eblana in horn hous that now was trespass out of this world and the self night next befor her death all leech and pothecari had taken counsel of her case and they said farther she should live becaus in the begin they said the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefor they that were of this imagin affirm how young madden had said truth for he had conscienc to let her die and not few and of these was young lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil govern as it was never other howbeit the mean peopl believ it otherwis but the law nor his judg did provid no remedi a redress god grant this was scant said but all cri with one acclaim nay by our virgin mother the wife should live and the babe to die in colour whereof they wax hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drink but the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack then young madden show all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holi religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to saint ultan of arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death wherebi they were all wondrous griev to whom young stephen had these word follow murmur sir is eke oft among lay folk both babe and parent now glorifi their maker the one in limbo gloom the other in purgefir but gramerci what of those godposs soul that we night impossibilis which is the sin against the holi ghost veri god lord and giver of life for sir he said our lust is brief we are mean to those small creatur within us and natur has other end than we then said dixon junior to punch costello wist he what end but he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortun him to be deliv of his spleen of lustihead whereat crotther of alba longa sang young malachi prais of that beast the unicorn how onc in the millennium he cometh by his horn the other all this while prick forward with their jibe wherewith they did malic him wit all and sever by saint foutinus his engin that he was abl to do ani manner of thing that lay in man to do thereat laugh they all right jocund onli young stephen and sir leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strang humour which he would not bewray and also for that he ru for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoev then spake young stephen orgul of mother church that would cast him out of her bosom of law of canon of lilith patron of abort of big wrought by wind of seed of bright or by potenc of vampir mouth to mouth or as virgilius saith by the influenc of the occid or by the reek of moonflow or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with effectu secuto or peradventur in her bath accord to the opinion of averro and mose maimonid he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infus and how in all our holi mother foldeth ever soul for god greater glori wherea that earth mother which was but a dam to bear beast should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman seal even that bless peter on which rock was holi church for all age found all they bachelor then ask of sir leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life a wari of mind he would answer as fit all and lay hand to jaw he said dissembl as his wont was that as it was inform him who had ever love the art of physic as might a layman and agre also with his experi of so seldomseen an accid it was good for that mother church belik at one blow had birth and death penc and in such sort deliv he scape their question that is truth pardi said dixon and or i
