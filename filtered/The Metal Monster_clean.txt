gigant unseen hand had reach up and snap them an instant the sever end ribbon aimless then bent turn down and dart earthward into the welter of cluster summit at the north and swift were gone while down upon the valley fell night good god whisper drake it was as though someth reach up broke those ray and drew them downlik thread i saw it i struggl with bewilder i saw it but i never saw anyth like it befor i end most inadequ it was purpos he whisper it was deliber as though someth reach up juggl with the ray broke them and drew them down like willow with the devil that dwell here quaver chiu ming some magnet phenomenon i was half angri at myself for my own touch of panic light can be deflect by passag through a magnet field of cours that it certain i dont know drake tone was doubt inde it would take a whale of a magnet field to have done thatit inconceiv he hark back to his first idea it was soso damn deliber he repeat devil mutter the frighten chines what that drake grip my arm and point to the north a deeper black had grown there while we had been talk a pool of dark against which the mountain summit stood out blade sharp edg faint lumin a gigant lanc of misti green fire dart from the black and thrust it point into the heart of the zenith follow it leap into the sky a host of the sparkl spear of light and now the black was like an ebon hand brandish a thousand javelin of tinsel flame the aurora i said it ought to be a good one muse drake gaze intent upon it did you notic the big sun spot i shook my head the biggest i ever saw notic it first at dawn this morn some littl aurora lighterthat spot i told youlook at that he cri the green lanc had fallen back the black gather itself togetherthen from it began to puls billow of radianc spangl with infinit

waver split and form into gigant sparkl march curtain of splendor a vast circl of light sprang out upon the fold of the flicker rush curtain misti at first it edg sharpen until they rest upon the blaze glori of the northern sky like a pale ring of cold flame and about it the aurora began to churn to heap itself to revolv toward the ring from everi side race the majest fold drew themselv togeth circl seeth around it like foam of fire about the lip of a cauldron and pour through the shine circl as though it were the mouth of that fabl cavern where old aeolus sit blow forth and breath back the wind that sweep the earth yesinto the ring mouth the aurora flew cascad in a column stream to earth then swift a mist swept over all the heaven veil that incred cataract magnet mutter drake i guess not it struck about where the ting pa was broken and seem drawn down like the ray i said purpos drake said and devilish it hit on all my nerv like alik a metal claw purpos and deliber there was intellig behind that intellig drakewhat intellig could break the ray of the set sun and suck down the aurora i dont know he answer devil croak chiu ming the devil that defi buddhaand have grown strong like a metal claw breath drake far to the west a sound came to us first a whisper then a wild rush a prolong wail a crackl a great light flash through the mist glow about us and fade again the wail the vast rush the retreat whisper then silenc and dark drop embrac upon the valley of the blue poppi chapter ii the sigil on the rock dawn came drake had slept well but i who had not his youth resili lay for long awak and uneasi i had hard sunk into troubl slumber befor dawn awaken me as we breakfast i approach direct that matter which my grow like for him was turn into strong desir drake i ask where are you go with you he laugh im foot loos and fanci free and i think you ought to have somebodi with you to help watch that cook he might get away the idea seem to appal him fine i exclaim heartili and thrust out my hand to him im think of strike over the rang soon to the manasarowar lake there a curious flora id like to studi anywher you say suit me he answer we clasp hand on our partnership and soon we were on our way to the valley western gate our unit caravan string along behind us mile after mile we trudg through the blue poppi discuss the enigma of the twilight and of the night in the light of day their breath of vagu terror was dissip there was no place for mysteri nor dread under this floor of brilliant sunshin the smile sapphir floor roll ever on befor us whisper littl play breez flew down the slope to gossip for a moment with the nod flower flock of rose finch race chatter overhead to quarrel with the tini willow warbler the chi u teb tok hold fief of the droop grace bower bend down to the littl laugh stream that for the past hour had chuckl and gurgl like a friend water babi besid us i had proven almost to my own satisfact that what we had beheld had been a creation of the extraordinari atmospher attribut of these highland an atmospher so uniqu as to make almost anyth of the kind possibl but drake was not convinc i know he said of cours i understand all thatsuperimpos layer of warmer air that might have bent the ray vortic in the higher level that might have produc just that effect of the captur aurora i admit it all possibl ill even admit it all probabl but damn me doc if i believ it i had too clear the feel of a conscious forc a someth that knew exact what it was doingand had a reason for it it was mid afternoon the spell of the valley upon us we had gone leisur the western mount was close the mouth of the gorg through which we must pass now plain befor us it did not seem as though we could reach it befor dusk and drake and i were reconcil to spend anoth night in the peac vale plod along deep in thought i was startl by his exclam he was stare at a point some hundr yard to his right i follow his gaze the tower cliff were a scant half mile away at some distant time there had been an enorm fall of rock this disintegr had form a gentl curv breast which slope down to merg with the valley floor willow and witch alder stunt birch and poplar had found roothold cloth it until onli their crowd outpost thrust forward in a waver semicircl held back seem by the blue hord show where it melt into the meadow in the center of this breast begin half way up it slope and stretch down into the flower field was a coloss imprint gray and brown it stood out against the green and blue of slope and level a rectangl all of thirti feet wide two hundr long the heel faint curv and from it hither end like claw four slender triangl radiat from it like twenti four point of a ten ray star irresist was it like a footprintbut what thing was there whose tread could leav such a print as this i ran up the slopedrak alreadi well in advanc i paus at the base of the triangl where were this thing inde a footprint the spread claw sprang from the flat of it the track was fresh at it upper edg were clip bush and split tree the white wood of the latter show where they had been slice as though by the stroke of a scimitar i step out upon the mark it was as level as though plane bent down and stare in utter disbelief of what my own eye beheld for stone and earth had been crush compress into a smooth microscop grain adamantin complex and in this matrix poppi still bear trace of their color were imbed like fossil a cyclon can and doe grip straw and thrust them unbroken through an inch boardbut what forc was there which could take the delic petal of a flower and set them like inlay within the surfac of a stone into my mind came recollect of the wail the crash in the night of the weird glow that had flash about us when the mist aros to hide the chain aurora it was what we heard i said the soundsit was then that this was made the foot of shin je chiu ming voic was tremul the lord of hell has trodden here i translat for drake benefit has the lord of hell but one foot ask dick polit he bestrid the mountain said chiu ming on the far side is his other footprint shin je it was who strode the mountain and set here his foot again i interpret drake cast a calcul glanc up to the cliff top two thousand feet about he muse well if shin je is built in our proport that make it about right the length of this thing would give him just about a two thousand foot leg yesh could just about straddl that hill your sure not serious i ask in constern what the hell he exclaim am i crazi this is no foot mark how could it be look at the mathemat niceti with which these edg are stamp outa though by a die that what it remind me ofa die it as if some imposs power had been use to press it down likelik a giant seal of metal in a mountain hand a sigila seal but whi i ask what could be the purpos better ask where the devil such a forc could be gotten togeth and how it came here he said lookexcept for this one place there isnt a mark anywher all the bush and the tree all the poppi and the grass are just as they ought to be how did whoever or whatev it was that made this get here and get away without leav ani trace but this damn if i dont think chiu ming explan put less strain upon the credul than ani i could offer i peer about it was so except for the mark there was no slightest sign of the unusu the abnorm but the mark was enough im for push up a notch or two and get into the gorg befor dark he was voic my own thought im will to face anyth humanbut im not keen to be press into a rock like a flower in a maiden book of poem just at twilight we drew out of the valley into the pass we travel a full mile along it befor dark forc us to make camp the gorg was narrow the far wall but a hundr feet away but we had no quarrel with them for their neighborli no their solid their immut breath confid back into us and after we had found a deep nich capabl of hold the entir caravan we file within poni and all i for one perfect will thus to spend the night let the air at dawn be what it would we dine within on bread and tea and then tire to the bone sought each his place upon the rocki floor i slept well wake onli onc or twice by chiu ming groan his dream evid were none of the pleasantest if there was an aurora i neither knew nor care my slumber was dreamless chapter iii ruth ventnor the dawn stream into the nich awaken us a covey of partridg ventur too close yield three to our gun we breakfast well and a littl later were push on down the cleft it descent though gradual was continu and therefor i was not surpris when soon we began to come upon evid of semi tropic veget giant rhododendron and tree fern gave way to occasion clump of state kopek and clump of the hardier bamboo we ad a few snow cock to our larderalthough they were out of their habitat fli down into the gorg from their peak and tabl land for some choic tidbit all that day we march on and when at night we made camp sleep came to us quick and overmast an hour after dawn we were on our way a brief stop we made for lunch press forward it was close to two when we caught the first sight of the ruin the soar verdur clad wall of the canyon had long been steadili march closer abov between their rim the wide ribbon of sky was like a fantast shore river shimmer dazzl everi cove and headland edg with an opalesc glimmer as of shine pear beach and as though we were sink in that sky stream depth it light kept lessen darken impercept with lumin shadow of ghost beryl drift veil of pellucid aquamarin limpid mist of glaucous chrysolit fainter more crepuscular becam the light yet never lose it crystallin qualiti now the high overhead river was but a brook becam a thread abrupt it vanish we pass into a tunnel fern wall fern roof garland with tawni orchid gay with carmin fungus and golden moss we step out into a blaze of sunlight befor us lay a wide green bowl held in the hand of the cluster hill shallow circular as though while plastic still the thumb of god had run round it rim shape it around it the peak crowd crane their lofti head to peer within it was about a mile in it diamet this hollow as my gaze then measur it it had three openingson that lay like a crack in the northeast slope anoth the tunnel mouth through which we had come the third lift itself out of the bowl creep up the precipit bare scarp of the western barrier straight to the north cling to the ochreous rock up and up until it vanish around a far distant shoulder it was a wide and bulwark road a road that spoke as clear as though it had tongu of human hand which had cut it there in the mountain breast an ancient road weari beyond belief beneath the tread of uncount year from the hollow the blind soul of loneli grope out to greet us never had i felt such loneli as that which lap the lip of the verdant bowl it was tangiblea though it had been pour from some reservoir of miseri a pool of despair half the width of the valley away the ruin began weird were they it visibl express they huddl in two bent row to the bottom they crouch in a wide cluster against the cliff from the cluster a curv row of them ran along the southern crest of the hollow a flight of shatter cyclopean step lift to a ledg and here a crumbl fortress stood irresist did the ruin seem a coloss hag flung prone lie listless helpless against the barrier base the huddl lower rank were the leg the cluster the bodi the upper row an outflung arm and abov the neck of the stairway the ancient fortress round and with two huge rag apertur in it northern front was an age bleach and wither head stare watch i look at draketh spell of the bowl was heavi upon him his face drawn the chinaman and tibetan were murmur terror written larg upon them a hell of a joint drake turn to me a shadow of a grin lighten the distress on his face but id rather chanc it than go back what dyou say i nod curios master my oppress we step over the rim rifl on the alert close behind us crowd the two servant and the poni the vale was shallow as i have said we trod the fragment of an olden approach to the green tunnel so the descent was not difficult here and there besid the path uprear huge broken block on them i thought i could see faint trace as of carvingsnow a suggest of gape arrow fang dragon jaw now the outlin of a scale bodi a hint of enorm batlik wing now we had reach the first of the crumbl pile that stretch down into the valley center half faint i fell against drake clutch to him for support a stream of utter hopeless was race upon us swirl and eddi around us reach to our heart with ghost finger drip with despair from everi shatter heap it seem to pour rush down the road upon us like a torrent engulf us submerg drown unseen it wasyet tangibl as water it sap the life from everi nerv weari fill me a desir to drop upon the stone to be roll away to die i felt drake bodi quiver even as mine knew that he was draw upon everi reserv of strength steadi he mutter steadi the tibetan shriek and fled the poni scrambl after him dim i rememb that mine carri precious specimen a surg of anger pass beat back the anguish i heard a sob from chiu ming saw him drop drake stop drew him to his feet we place him between us thrust each an arm through his own then like swimmer head bent we push on buffet that inexplic invis flood as the path rose it forc lessen my vital grew and the terribl desir to yield and be swept away wane now we had reach the foot of the cyclopean stair now we were half up themand now as we struggl out upon the ledg on which the watch fortress stood the clutch stream shoal swift the shoal becam safe dri land and the cheat unseen maelstrom swirl harmless beneath us we stood erect gasp for breath again like swimmer who have fought their utmost and bare so bare won there was an almost impercept movement at the side of the ruin portal out dart a girl a rifl drop from her hand straight she sped toward me and as she ran i recogn

ventnor god but im glad to see you walter goodwin believ me i am howevergo on ruth at the end of the second week she said we knew we were lost we were deep in the heart of the rang all around us was a forest of enorm snow top peak the gorg the canyon the valley that we tri led us east and west north and south it was a maze and in it we seem to be go ever deeper there was not the slightest sign of human life it was as though no human be except ourselv had ever been there game was plenti we had no troubl in get food and sooner or later of cours we were bound to find our way out we didnt worri it was five night ago that we camp at the head of a love littl valley there was a mound that stood up like a tini watch tower look down it the tree grew round like tall sentinel we built our fire in that mound and after we had eaten martin slept i sat watch the beauti of the sky and of the shadowi vale i heard no one approachbut someth made me leap to my feet look behind me a man was stand just within the glow of firelight watch me a tibetan i ask she shook her head troubl in her eye not at all ventnor turn his head ruth scream and awaken me i caught a glimps of the fellow befor he vanish a short purpl mantl hung from his shoulder his chest was cover with fine chain mail his leg were swath and bound by the thong of his high buskin he carri a small round hide cover shield and a short two edg sword his head was helmet he belong in factoh at least twenti centuri back he laugh in plain enjoy of our amaz go on ruth he said and took up his watch but martin did not see his face she went on and

awaken as he move the man step out of the light and was gone i think he had not seen martin had believ that i was alon we put out the fire move farther into the shadow of the tree but i could not sleepi sat hour after hour my pistol in my hand she pat the automat in her belt my rifl close besid me the hour went bydread at last i doze when i awaken again it was dawnandand she cover her eye then two men were look down on me one was he who had stood in the firelight they were talk interrupt ventnor again in archaic persian persian i repeat blank archaic persian veri much so he nod ive a fair knowledg of the modern tongu and a rather unusu command of arab the modern persian as you know come straight through from the speech of xerx of cyrus of darius whom alexand of macedon conquer it has been chang main by take on a load of arab word wellther wasnt a trace of the arab in the tongu they were speak it sound odd of coursebut i could understand quit easili they were talk about ruth to be explicit they were discuss her with exceed frank martin she cri wrath well all right he went on half repent as a matter of fact i had seen the pair steal up my rifl was under my hand so i lay there quiet listen you can realiz walter that when i caught sight of those two look as though they had materi from dariuss ghost hord my scientif curios was arousedprodigi so in my interest i pass over the matter of their speech not alon becaus i thought ruth asleep but also becaus i took into consider that the mode of polit express chang with the centuriesand these gentlemen clear belong at least twenti centuri backth real truth is i was consum with curios they had got to a point where they were detail with what pleasur a certain mysteri person whom they seem to regard with much fear and respect would contempl her i was wonder how long my desir to observefor to the anthropologist they were most fascinatingcould hold my hand back from my rifl when ruth awaken she jump up like a littl furi fire a pistol point blank at them their amaz waswellludicr i know it seem incred but they seem to know noth of firearmsthey certain act as though they didnt they simpli flew into the timber i took a pistol shot at one but miss ruth hadnt though she had wing her man he left a red trail behind him we didnt follow the trail we made for the opposit directionand as fast as possibl noth happen that day or night next morn creep up a slope we caught sight of a suspici glitter a mile or two away in the direct we were go we sought shelter in a small ravin in a littl while over the hill and half a mile away from us came about two hundr of these fellow march along and they were inde dariuss men men of that persia which had been dead for millennium there was no mistak them with their high cover shield their great bow their javelin and armor they pass we doubl we built no fire that nightand we ought to have turn the poni loos but we didnt it carri my instrument and ammunit and i felt we were go to need the latter the next morn we caught sight of anoth bandor the same we turn again we stole through a tree cover plain we struck an ancient road it led south into the peak again we follow it it brought us here it isnt as you observ the most comfort of place we struck across the hollow to the crevicew knew noth of the entranc you came through the hollow was not pleasant either but it was penetr then we cross as we were about to enter the cleft there issu out of it a most unusu and disconcert chorus of soundswail crash splinter i start shot a look at dick absorb he was drink in ventnor everi word so unusu sowel disconcert is the best word i can think of that we were not encourag to proceed also the peculiar unpleas of the hollow was increas rapid we made the best time we could back to the fortress and when next we tri to go through the hollow to search for anoth outletw couldnt you know whi he end abrupt but men in ancient armor men like those of darius dick broke the silenc that had follow this amaz recit it incred yes agre ventnor isnt it but there they were of cours i dont maintain that they were relic of dariuss armi they might have been of xerx befor himor of artaxerx after him but there they certain were drake live breath replica of exceed ancient persian whi they might have been the wall carv on the tomb of khosro come to life i mention darius becaus he fit in with the most plausibl hypothesi when alexand the great smash his empir he did it rather thorough there wasnt much sympathi for the vanquish in those day and it entir conceiv that a citi or two in alexand way might have gather up a fleet regiment or so for protect and have decid not to wait for him but to hunt for cover natur they would have gone into the almost inaccess heart of the high rang there is noth imposs in the theori that they found shelter at last up here as long as histori run this has been a well nigh unknown land penetr some mountain guard easili defend valley they might have decid to settl down for a time have rebuilt a citi rais a govern lay low in a sentenc wait for the storm to blow over whi did they stay well they might have found the new life more pleasant than the old and they might have been lock in their valley by some accidentlandslid rockfal seal up the entranc there are a dozen reason possibl but those who hunt you werent lock in object drake no ventnor grin ruefulli no they certain werent mayb we drift into their preserv by a way they dont know mayb theyv found anoth way out im sure i dont know but i do know what i saw the nois martin i said for his descript of these had been the descript of those we had heard in the blue valley have you heard them sinc yes he answer hesit odd and you think thosethos soldier you saw are still hunt for you havent a doubt of it he repli more cheer they didnt look like chap who would give up a hunt easilyat least not a hunt for such novel interest and therefor desir and delect game as we must have appear to them martin i said decis where your poni well tri the hollow again at onc there ruthand wed never be abl to hold back such number as youv describ you feel strong enough to tri it chapter iv metal with a brain the eager the relief in his voic betray the tension the anxieti which until now he had hidden so well and hot shame burn me for my shrink my dread of again pass through that haunt vale i certain do i was onc more master of myself drakedont you agre sure he repli sure ill look after rutheri mean miss ventnor the glint of amus in ventnor eye at this fade abrupt his face grew somber wait he said i carri away somesom exhibit from the crevic of the nois goodwin what kind of exhibit i ask eager put em where theyd be safe he continu ive an idea theyr far more curious than our armor menand of far more import at ani rate we must take them with us go with ruth you and drake and look at them and bring them back with the poni then well make a start a few minut more probabl wont make much differencebut hurri he turn back to his watch order chiu ming to stay with him i follow ruth and drake down the ruin stairway at the bottom she came to me laid littl hand on my shoulder walter she breath im frighten im so frighten im afraid to tell even mart he doesnt like them either these littl thing your go to see he like them so littl that hes afraid to let me know how littl he doe like them but what are they what to fear about them ask drake see what you think she led us slowli almost reluct toward the rear of the fortress they lay in a littl heap at the mouth of the cleft where we heard the nois martin pick them up and drop them in a sack befor we ran through the hollow theyr grotesqu and theyr almost cute and they make me feel as though they were the tiniest tippi tip of the claw of some incred larg cat just steal around the corner a terribl cat a cat as big as a mountain she end breathless we climb through the crumbl masonri into a central open court here a clear spring bubbl up in a ruin and choke stone basin close to the ancient well was their poni content brows in the thick grass that grew around it from one of it hamper ruth took a larg cloth bag to carri them she said and trembl we pass through what had onc been a great door into anoth chamber larger than that we had just left and it was in better preserv the ceil unbroken the light dim after the blaze sun of the court near it center she halt us befor me ran a two feet wide rag crack split the floor and drop down into black depth beyond was an expans of smooth flag almost clear of debri drake gave a low whistl i follow his point finger in the wall at the end whirl two enorm dragon shape cut in low relief their gigant wing their monstrous coil cover the near unbroken surfac and these chimera were the shape upon the upthrust block of the haunt roadway in ruth gaze i read a nameless fear a half shudder fascin but she was not look at the cavern dragon her gaze was fix upon what at my first glanc seem to be a rais and pattern circl in the dust cover floor not more than a foot in width it shone wan with a pale metal bluish luster as though i thought it had been recent polish compar with the wall tremend wing figur this floor design was trivial ludicr insignific what could there be about it to stamp that dread upon ruth face i leap the crevic dick join me now i could see that the ring was not continu it broken circl was made of sharpli edg cube about an inch in height separ from each other with mathemat exact by anoth inch of space i count themther were nineteen almost touch them with their base were an equal number of pyramid of tetrahedron as sharpli angl and of similar length they lay on their side with tip point starlik to six sphere cluster like a convention five petal primros in the exact center five of these spheresth petalswer i rough calcul about an inch and a half in diamet the ball they enclos larger by almost an inch so order was their arrang so much like a geometr design nice done by some clever child that i hesit to disturb it i bent and stiffen the first touch of dread upon me for within the ring close to the cluster globe was a miniatur replica of the giant track in the poppi valley it stood out from the dust with the same hint of crush forc the same die cut sharp the same metal suggestionand point toward the globe were the claw mark of the four spread star point i reach down and pick up one of the pyramid it seem to cling to the rock it was with effort that i wrench it away it gave to the touch a slight sensat of warmthhow can i describ ita warmth that was live i weigh it in my hand it was odd heavi twice the weight i should say of platinum i drew out a glass and examin it decid the pyramid was metal but of finest almost silken textureand i could not place it among ani of the known metal it certain was none i had ever seen yet it was as certain metal it was striatedslend filament radiat from tini dulli lustrous point within the polish surfac and sudden i had the weird feel that each of these point was an eye peer up at me scrutin me there came a startl cri from dick look at the ring the ring was in motion faster the cube move faster the circl revolv the pyramid rais themselv stood bolt upright on their squar base the six roll sphere touch them join the spin and with sleight of hand sudden the ring drew togeth it unit coalesc cube and pyramid and globe thread with a curious suggest of ferment with the same startl abrupt there stood erect where but a moment befor they had seeth a littl figur grotesqu a weird humor a vagu terrifi foot high shape squar and angl and point and animatea though a child should build from nurseri block a fantast shape which abrupt is fill with throb life a troll from the kindergarten a kobold of the toy onli for a second it stood then began swift to chang melt with quicksilv quick from one outlin into anoth as squar and triangl and sphere chang place their shift were like the transform one see within a kaleidoscop and in each vanish form was the suggest of unfamiliar harmoni of a subtl a transcendent geometr art as though each swift shape were a symbol a word euclid problem given volit geometri endow with conscious it ceas then the cube drew one upon the other until they form a pedest nine inch high up this pillar roll the larger globe balanc itself upon the top the five sphere follow it cluster like a ring just below it the other cube race up click two by two on the outer arc of each of the five ball at the end of these twin block a pyramid took it place tip each with a point the lilliputian fantasi was now a pedest of cube surmount by a ring of globe from which sprang a star of five arm the sphere began to revolv faster and faster they spun around the base of the crown globe the arm becam a disc upon which tini brilliant spark appear cluster vanish onli to reappear in greater number the troll swept toward me it glide the finger of panic touch me i sprang asid and swift as light it follow seem to pois itself to leap drop it it was ruth cri but befor i could let fall the pyramid i had forgotten was in my hand the littl figur touch me and a paralyz shock ran through me my finger clench lock i stood muscl and nerv bound unabl to move the littl figur paus it whirl disc shift from the horizont plane on which it spun it was as though it cock it head to look up at meand again i had the sens of innumer eye peer at me it did not seem menacingit attitud was inquisit wait almost as though it had ask for someth and wonder whi i did not let it have it the shock still held me rigid although a tingl in everi nerv told me of return forc the disc tilt back to place bent toward me again i heard a shout heard a bullet strike the pigmi that now clear menac heard the bullet ricochet without the slightest effect upon it dick leap besid me rais a foot and kick at the thing there was a flash of light and upon the instant he crash down as though struck by a giant hand lay sprawl and inert upon the floor there was a scream from ruth there was soft sibil rustl all about her i saw her leap the crevic drop on her knee besid drake there was movement on the flag where she stood a score or more of faint shine bluish shape were march therepyramid and cube and sphere like those form the shape that stood befor me there was a curious sharp tang of ozon in the air a percept tighten as of electr tension they swept to the edg of the fissur swam togeth and there hang half over the gap was a bridg half span it a weird and fairi arch made up of altern cube and angl the shape at my feet disintegr resolv itself into unit that race over to the beckon span at the hither side of the crack they click into place even as had the other befor me now was a bridg complet except for the one arc near the middl where an angl gap mar it i felt the littl object i held puls within my hand strive to escap i drop it the tini shape swept to the bridg ascend itdrop into the gap the arch was completehang in one fli span over the depth upon it over it as though they had but await this complet roll the six globe and as they drop to the farther side the end of the bridg nearest me rais itself in air curv itself like a scorpion tail drew itself into a closer circl arc and drop upon the floor beyond again the sibil rustlingand cube and pyramid and

left side from right side sprang armsfear arm that grew and grew as globe and cube and angl race up the column side and click into place each upon each after the other with magic quick the arm

for us to follow within the dark the high ribbon of sky had vanishedseem to be overcast for i could see no star within the dark i began again to sens faint movement soft stir all about us i had the feel that on each side and behind us move an invis host there someth move all about usgo with us ruth echo my thought it the wind i said and pausedfor there was no wind from the black befor us came a success of curious muffl click like a smother mitrailleus the luminesc that cloth norhala brighten deepen the dark cross she point into the void ahead then as we start forward thrust out a hand to ruth held her back drake and ventnor drew close to them question anxious but i step forward out of the dim gleam befor me were two cube one i judg in that uncertain light to be six feet high the other half it bulk from them a shaft of pale blue phosphoresc pierc the murk they stood the smaller press against the side of the larger for all the world like a pair of immens nurseri block place like step by some giant child as my eye swept over them i saw that the shine shaft was an unbroken span of cube not multi arch like the lilliputian bridg of the dragon chamber but flat and run out over an abyss that gape at my veri feet all of a hundr feet they stretch a slender lustrous girder cross unguess depth of gloom from far far below came the faint whisper of rush water i falter for these were the block that had form the bodi of the monster of the hollow it flail arm the thing that had play so murder with the armor men and now had shape itself into this anchor quiescent bridg do not fear it was the woman speak soft as one would reassur a child ascend cross they obey me i step firm upon the first block climb to the second the span stretch sharp edg smooth onli a slender shimmer line reveal where each great cube held fast to the other i walk at first slowli then with ever increas confid for up from the surfac stream a guid a hold forc that was like a host of littl invis hand steadi me keep firm my feet i look down the myriad of enigmat eye were stare stare up at me from deep within they fascin me i felt my pace slow a vertigo seiz me resolut i drag my gaze up and ahead march on from the depth came more clear the sound of the water now there were but a few feet more of the bridg befor me i reach it end drop my feet over felt them touch a smaller cube and descend over the span came ventnor he was lead his laden poni he had bandag it eye so that it could not look upon the narrow way it was tread and close behind a hand rest reassur upon it flank strode drake swing along careless the littl beast ambl along seren sure foot as all it mountain kind and docil to dark and guidanc then an arm about ruth float norhala now she was besid us drop her arm from ruth glide past us on for a hundr yard or more we went and then she drew us a littl toward the unseen canyon wall she stood befor us shield us one golden call she sent i look back into the dark someth like an enorm dim shimmer rod was rais itself higher it rose and higher now it stood upright a slender tower pillar a gigant slim figur whose tip point a full hundr feet in the air then slowli it inclin itself toward us drew closer closer to the ground touch and lay there for an instant inert abrupt it vanish but well i knew what i had seen the span over which we had pass had rais itself even as had the babi bridg of the fortress had lift itself across the chasm and drop itself upon the hither verg had disintegr into it unit was follow us a bridg of metal that could build itselfand break itself a think conscious metal bridg a metal bridg with volitionwith mindthat was follow us there sigh from behind a soft sustain wail rapid it near us a wan glimmer shape drew by halt it was like a rigid serpent cut from a gigant squar bar of cold blue steel it head was a pyramid a tetrahedron it length vanish in the further dark the head rais itself the block that form it neck separ into open wedg like a

to followand it did not need to it could move as a composit as well as in unit move intellig consciouslya the smite thing had move come norhala command check my thought we fell in behind her look up i caught the friend sparkl of a star knew the cleft was widen the star point grew thicker we step out into a valley small as that hollow from which we had fled ring like it with heaven touch summit i could see clear the place was suffus with a soft radianc as though into it the far bright star were pour all their ray fill it as a cup with their pale flame it was lumin as the alaskan valley when on white arctic night they are light the athabascan believ by the gleam spear of hunt god the wall of the valley seem to be drawn back into infinit distanc the shimmer mist that had nimbus norhala had vanishedor merg into the wan gleam had becom one with it i stare straight at her strive to clarifi in my own cloud thought what it was that i had sens as inhumannev of our world or it peopl yet this convict came not becaus of the light that had hover about her nor of her summon of the lightn nor even of her control of thosethingswhich had smitten the armor men and span for us the abyss all of that i was certain lay in the domain of the explic could be resolv into normal onc the basic fact were gain sudden i knew side by side with what we term the human there dwelt within this woman an actual conscious foreign to earth passionless at least as we know passion order mathematicalan eman of the etern law which guid the circl star this it was that had move in the gestur which had evok the lightn this it was that had spoken in the song which were those gestur transform into sound this it was that someth greater than my conscious knew and accept someth which share nothat reign seren and untroubl upon the throne of her mind someth utter uncomprehend utter unconsci of cosmic blind to all human emot that spread itself like a veil over her own conscious that plate her thoughtthat was a strang wordwhi had it come to mesometh that had set it mark upon her likeliketh gigant claw print on the poppi field the littl print of the dragon hall i caught at my mind whirl i thought then in the grip of fantasi strove by take minut note of her to bring myself back to normal her veil had slip from her bare her neck her arm the right shoulder under the smooth throat a buckl of dull gold held the sheer diaphan fold of the pale amber silk which swath the high and round breast hide no goddess curv of them a wide and golden girdl clasp the waist cover the round hip and thigh the long narrow and high arch feet were shod with golden sandal lace just below the round knee with flat turquois stud band and shine through the amber fold as glow abov them the miracl of her bodi the dream

old questioningal that i had forgotten and thought forgotten forev the golden voic diedsh who had spoken was gone from us like the fade out of a phantom like the break of a film a flicker shot over the sky anoth and anoth a brilliant ray of intens green like that of a distant searchlight swept to the zenith hung for a moment and withdrew up came pour the lanc and the streamer of the aurora faster and faster banner and slender shine spear of green and iridesc blue and smoki glisten red the valley sprang into full view i felt ventnor grip upon my wrist i follow his point finger into the

the light that set them gleam our pace had slackenedi look about me the wall of the cleft or tunnel were perpendicular smooth and shine with a cold metal greenish glow between the wall like rhythmic flash of fire fli puls soft and fugit glimmer that carri a sens of the infinit minuteof electron it came to me rather than atom their irradi was greenish like the wall but i was certain that these corpuscl did not come from them they blink and fade like mote within a shift sunbeam or to use a more scientif comparison like colloid within the illumin field of the ultramicroscop and like these

resum the distanc it had former maintain between us the vanguard of the metal thing began to race with an incred speed they fled into were lost in an instant within the lumin distanc the cube that bore the woman and girl acceler flew faster and faster onward and as swift our own follow it the lustrous wall flow by dizzili we had swept over toward the right wall of the cleft and were glide over a broad ledg this ledg was i judg all of a hundr feet in width from it the floor of the place was drop rapid the opposit precipic were slowli draw closer after us flow the flank host steadili our ledg aros and the floor of the canyon drop now we were twenti feet abov it now thirti and the charact of the cliff was chang vein of quartz shone under the metal plate like cut crystal like cloudi opal here was a splash of vermilion there a patch of amber band of pallid ochr stain it my gaze was caught by a line of inki black in the exact center of the fall floor so black was it that at first glanc i took it for a vein of jetti lignit it widen it was a crack a fissur now it was a yard in width now three and black seem to well up from within it black that was the veri essenc of the depth steadili the ebon rift expand spread sudden wide open in two sharp edg fli wedg earth had drop away at our side a gulf had open an abyss strike down depth upon depth profound immeasur we were human atom ride upon a steed of sorceri and race along a split rampart of infinit space i look behindscor of the cube were dart from the metal host trail us in a long column of twos they flash by race ahead far in front of us a gloom began to grow deepen until we were rush into blackest night through the murk stab a long lanc of pale blue phosphoresc it unrol like a ribbon of wan flame flick like a serpent tongueheld steadi i felt the thing beneath us leap forward it veloc grew prodigi the wind beat upon us with hurrican forc i shield my eye with my hand and peer through the chink of my finger rang direct in our path was a barricad of the cube and upon them we were race like a fli batter ram involuntarili i close my eye against the annihil impact that seem inevit the thing on which we rode lift we were soar at a long angl straight to the top of the barrier were upon it and still with that aw speed uncheck were hurtl through the black over the shaft of phosphoresc the ribbon of pale light that i had watch pierc it and knew now was but anoth span of the cube that but a littl befor had fled past us beneath the span on each side of it i sens illimit void we were over rush along in dark there began a mighti tumult a vast crash and roar the clangor wax beat about us with tremend stroke of sound far away was a dim glow as of rise sun through heavi mist of dawn the mist fadedmil away gleam what at first glimps seem inde to be the rise sun a gigant orb whose lower limb just touch was sharpli horizont cut by the black as though at it base that black was frozen the sun reason return to me told me this globe could not be that what was it then ra harmachi of the egyptian strip of his wing exil and grow old in the corridor of the dead or that mock luminari the cold phantom of the god of light and warmth which the old norsemen believ was set in their frozen hell to torment the damn i thrust asid the fantasi impati but sun or no sun light stream from this orb light in multicolor lanc ray banish the black through which we had been fli closer we came and closer lighter it grew about us and by the grow light i saw that still besid us ran the abyss and even louder more thunder becam the clamor at the foot of the radiant disk i glimps a lumin pool into it out of the depth protrud a tremend rectangular tongu gleam like gray steel on the tongu an inki shape appear it lift itself from the abyss rush upon the disk and took form like a gigant spider it was squat and horn for an instant it was silhouet against the smile sphere pois itselfand vanish through it now not far ahead silhouet as had been the spider shape blacken into sight a cube and on it ruth and norhala it seem to hover to wait it a door drake shout beat thin in my ear against the hurrican of sound what i thought had been an orb was inde a gateway a portal and it was gigant the light stream through it the flame color the lightn glare the drift shadow were all beyond it the suggest of sphere had been an illus born of the dark in which we were move and in it own luminesc and i saw that the steel tongu was a ramp a slide drop down into the gulf norhala rais her hand high abov her head up from the dark flew an incred shapelik a monstrous armor flat back crab angl spike protrud from it it huge bodi was spangl with dart greenish flame it swept beneath us and by on it back were multitudin breast from

enorm angl arrow point and lunett swift it form shift an instant it hover half disintegr now i saw spin sphere and dart cube and pyramid click into new posit the front and side leg lengthen the back leg shorten fit themselv plain to what must be a vari angl of descent beyond and it was no chimera no kraken of the abyss it was a car made of the metal thing i caught again the flash and thought that they were jewel or heap of shine ore carri by the conscious machin it vanish in it place hung pois the cube that bore the enigmat woman and ruth then they were gone and we stood where but an instant

said flit unseen past ruth perhap absorb in her watch over her brother perhap through some hidden open in this room of her yuruk let drop the curtain sidl back to the first room we after him the two there had not move we drew the saddlebag close prop ourselv against them the black eunuch squat a dozen feet away face us chin upon his knee take us in with unblink eye blank of ani emot then he began to move slowli his tremend long arm in easi sooth motion the hand run along the floor upon their talon in arc and circl it was curious how these hand seem to be endow with a volit of their own

hypnot i sprang from the lethargi close upon me in one quick side glanc i saw drake head noddingnod in time to the movement of the black hand i jump to my feet shake with an intens of rage unfamiliar to me thrust my pistol into the wrinkl face damn you i cri stop that stop it and turn your back the cord muscl of the arm contract the claw of the slither paw drew in as though he were about to clutch me the ebon pool of eye were cover with a frozen film of hate he could not have known what was this tube with which i menac him but it threat he certain sens and was afraid to meet he squatter about wrap his arm around his knee crouch with back toward us what the matter ask drake drowsili he tri to hypnot us i answer short and pretti near did so that what it was he was now wide awak i watch those hand of his and got sleepier and sleepieri guess wed better tie mr yuruk up he jump to his feet no i said restrain him no hes safe enough as long as were on the alert i dont want to use ani forc on him yet wait until we know we can get someth worth while by do it all right he nod grim but when the time come im tell you straight doc im go the limit there someth about that human spider that make me itch to squash himslowli ill have no compunctionwhen it worth while i answer as grim we sank down again against the saddlebag drake brought out a black pipe look at it sorrow at me appeal all mine was on that poni that bolt i answer his wist all mine was on my beast too he sigh and i lost my pouch in that spurt from the ruin he sigh again clamp white teeth down upon the stem of cours he said at last if ventnor was right in thatthat disembodi analysi of his it ratherwel terrifi isnt it it all of that i repli and consider more metal he said drake muse thing of metal with brain of think crystal

move actual there has been prodigi motion but it is not conscious motion i object ah but how do you know he ask if jacqu loeb is right that action of the iron molecul is everi bit as conscious a movement as the least and the greatest of our own there is absolut no differ between them your and my and it everi movement is noth but an involuntari and inevit reaction to a certain stimulus if hes

your simil again drake the file against the magnet a walk is a constant break of the current take a motion pictur of a man walk and run it through the lantern rapid and he seem to be fli we have none of the awkward fall and recoveri that are the tempo of walk as we see it i take it that the movement of these thing is a conscious break of the gravit current just as much as is our own movement but by a rhythm so swift that it appear to be continu doubtless if we could so control our sight as to admit the vibrat of light slowli enough we would see this appar smooth motion as a seri of leapsjust

sens known and unknown i gotglimpsesgoodwin but i cannot understand we have agre for reason that seem suffici to us to call these thing metal dick i repli but that doe not necessarili mean that they are compos of ani metal that we know nevertheless be metal they must be of crystallin structur as gregori has point out crystal and what we call live matter had an equal start in the first essenti of life we cannot conceiv life without give it the attribut of some sort of conscious hunger cannot be anyth but conscious and there is no other stimulus to eat but hunger the crystal eat the extract of power from food is conscious becaus it is purpos and there can be no purpos without conscious similar the power to work from such deriv energi is also purpos and therefor conscious the crystal do both and the crystal can transmit all these abil to their children just as we do for although there would seem to be no reason whi they should not continu to grow to gigant size under favor conditionsyet they do not they reach a size beyond which they do not develop instead they budgiv birth in factto smaller one which increas until they reach the size of the preced generat and like the children of man and anim these younger generat grow on precis as their progenitor veri well thenw arriv at the concept of a metal crystallin be which by some explos of the forc of evolut has burst from the to us familiar and appar inert stage into these thing that hold us and is there ani greater differ between the form with which we are familiar and them than there is between us and the crawl amphibian which is our remot ancestor or between that and the amoebath littl swim stomach from which it evolv or the amoeba and the inert jelli of the protobion as for what ventnor call a group conscious i would assum that he mean a communal intellig such as that shown by the bee and the antsthat in the case of the former maeterlinck call the spirit of the hive it is shown in their groupingsjust as the geometr arrang of those group show also clear their crystallin intellig i submit that in their rapid coordin either for attack or movement or work without appar communic have pass between the unit

a command but what can we dojust two menagainst these thing he groan mayb well find outwhen were back in the citi i answer well his old reckless cheer came back to him in everi crisi of this old globe it been up to one man to turn the trick were two and at the worst we can onli go down fight a littl befor the rest of us so after all whatev the hell what the hell for a time we were silent well he said at last we have to go to the citi in the morn he laugh sound as though we were live in the suburb somehow doesnt it it cant be mani hour befor dawn i said turn in for a while ill wake you when i think youv slept enough it doesnt seem fair he protest but sleepili im not sleepi i told him nor was i but whether i was or not i want to question yuruk uninterrupt and undisturb drake stretch himself out when his breath show him fast asleep inde i slip over to the black eunuch and crouch right hand close to the butt of my automat face him chapter xvii yuruk yuruk i whisper you love us as the wheat field love the hail we are as welcom to you as the death cord to the condemn lo a door open into a land of unpleas dream you thought seal and we came through answer my question truth and it may be that we shall return through that door interest well up in the depth of the black eye there is a way from here he mutter nor doe it pass throughthem i can show it to you i had not been blind to the flash of malic of cun that had shot across the wrinkl face where doe that way lead i ask there were those who sought us men clad in armor with javelin and arrow doe your way lead to them yuruk for a time he hesit the lashless lid half close yes he said sullen the way lead to them to their place but will it not be safer for you thereamong your kind i dont know that it will i answer prompt those who are unlik us smote those who are like us and drove them back when they would have taken and slain us whi is it not better to remain with them than to go to our kind who would destroy us they would not he said if you gave themher he thrust a long thumb backward toward sleep ruth cherki would forgiv much for her and whi should you not she is onli a woman he spatin a way that made me want to kill him besid he end have you no art to amus him cherki i ask cherki he whine is yuruk a fool not to know that in the world without new thing have arisen sinc long ago we fled from iskand into the secret valley what have you to beguil cherki beyond this woman flesh much i think go then to himunafraid cherki there was a familiar sound to that cherki of courseit was the name of xerx the persian conqueror corrupt by time into thischerki and iskand equal of coursealexand ventnor had been right yuruk i demand direct is she whom you call goddessnorhalaof the peopl of cherki long ago he answer long long ago there was troubl in their citi even in the great dwell place of cherki i fled with her who was the mother of the goddess there were twenti of us and we fled herebi the way which i will show you he leer cun i gave no sign of interest she who was the mother of the goddess found favor in the sight of the ruler here he went on but after a time she grew old and ugli and wither so he slew herlik a littl mound of dust she danc and blew away after he had slain her and also he slew other who had grown displeas to him he blast mea he was blast he point to ventnor then it was that recov i found my crook shoulder the goddess was born here she is kin to him who rule how els could she shed the lightn was not the father of iskand the god zeus ammon who came to iskand mother in the form of a great snake well at ani rate the goddess was bornshedd of the lightn even from her birth and she is as you see her cleav to your kind cleav to your kind sudden he shrill better is it to be whip by your brother than to be eaten by the tiger cleav to your kind looki will show you the way to them he sprang to his feet clasp my wrist in one of his long hand led me through the curtain oval into the cylindr hall part the curtain of norhala bedroom and push me within over the floor he slid still hold fast to me and press against the farther wall an ovoid slice of the gemlik materi slid asid reveal a doorway i glimps a path a trail lead into a forest pallid green beneath the wan light this way thrust itself like a black tongu into the boskag and vanish in the depth follow it he point take those who came with you and follow it the wrinkl upon his face writh with his eager you will go pant yuruk you will take them and go by that path not yet i answer absent not yet and was brought abrupt to full alert vigil by the flame of rage that fill the eye thrust so close lead back i direct curt he slid the door into place turn sullen i follow wonder what were the sourc of the bitter hatr he so plain bore for us the reason for his eager to be rid of us despit the command of this woman who to him at least was goddess and by that curious human habit of seek for the complex when the simpl answer lie close fail to recogn that it was jealousi of us that was the root of his behavior that he wish to be as it would seem he had been for year the onli human thing near norhala fail to realiz this and with ruth and drake was terribl to pay for this failur i look down upon the pair sleep sound upon ventnor lost still in tranc sit i order the eunuch and turn your back to me i drop down besid drake my mind wrestl with the mysteri but everi sens alert for movement from the black glibli enough i had pass over dick question as to the conscious of the metal peopl now i face it know it to be the veri crux of these incred phenomena admit too that despit all my special plead about that point swirl in my own mind the thickest mist of uncertainti that their sens of order was immens beyond a man was plain as plain was it that their knowledg of magnet forc and it manipul were far beyond the sphere of human that they had realize of beauti this palac of norhala provedand no human imagin could have conceiv it nor human hand have made it thought of beauti real what were their sens through which their conscious fed nine in number had been the sapphir oval set within the golden zone of the disk clear it came to me that these were sens organ butnin sens and the great starshow mani had they and the cubesdid they open as did globe and pyramid conscious itselfaft all what is it a secret of the brain the cumul express wholli chemic of the multitud of cell that form us the inexplic governor of the citi of the bodi of which these myriad of cell are the citizensand creat by them out of themselv to rule is it what mani call the soul or is it a finer form of matter a self realiz forc which use the bodi as it vehicl just as other forc use for their vestment other machin after all i thought what is this conscious self of our the ego but a spark of realize run continu along the path of time within the mechan we call the brain make contact along that path as the electr spark at the end of a wire is there a sea of this conscious forc which lap the shore of the farthest flung star that find express in everythingman and rock metal and flower jewel and cloud limit in it express onli by the limit of that which anim and in essenc the same in all if so then this problem of the life of the metal peopl ceas to be a problem was answer so think i becam awar of increas light strode past yuruk to the door and peep out dawn was pale the sky i stoop over drake shook him on the instant he was awak alert i onli need a littl sleep dick i said when the sun is well up call me whi it dawn he whisper goodwin you ought not to have let me sleep so long i feel like a damn pig never mind i said but watch the eunuch close i roll myself up in his warm blanket sank almost instant into dreamless slumber chapter xviii into the pit high was the sun when i awaken or so i suppos open my eye upon a flood of daylight as i lay lazili recollect rush upon me it was no sky into which i was gaze it was the dome of norhala elfin home and drake had not arous me whi and how long had i slept i jump to my feet stare about ruth nor drake nor the black eunuch was there ruth i shout drake there was no answer i ran to the doorway peer up into the white vault of the heaven i set the time of day as close to seven i had slept then three hour more or less yet short as that time of slumber had been i felt marvel refresh reenerg the effect i was certain of the extraordinarili tonic qualiti of the atmospher of this place but where were the other where yuruk i heard ruth laughter some hundr yard to the left half hidden by a screen of flower shrub i saw a small meadow within it a half dozen littl white goat nuzzl around her and dick she was milk one of them reassur i drew back into the chamber knelt over ventnor his condit was unchang my gaze fell upon the pool that had been norhala bath long i look at it then satisfi myself that the milk process was not finish slip off my cloth and splash about i had just time to get back in my cloth when through the doorway came the pair each carri a porcelain pannikin full of milk there was no shadow of fear or horror on her face it was the old ruth who stood befor me nor was there effort in the smile she gave me she had been wash clean in the water of sleep dont worri walter she said i know what your think but imm again where is yuruk i turn to drake brusk to smother the sob of sheer happi i felt rise in my throat and at his wink and warn grimac abrupt forebor to press the question you men pick out the thing and ill get breakfast readi said ruth drake pick up the teakettl and motion me befor him about yuruk he whisper when he had gotten outsid i gave him a littl object lesson persuad him to go down the line a bit show him my pistol and then pick off one of norhala goat with it hate to do it but i knew it would be good for his soul he gave one screech and fell on his face and grovel thought it was a lightn bolt i figur decid i had been steal norhala stuff yuruk i told him that what youll get and wors if you lay a finger on that girl insid there and then what happen i ask he beat it back there he grin point toward the forest through which ran the path the eunuch had shown me probabl hide back of a tree as we fill the contain at the outer spring i told him of the revel and the offer yuruk had made to me whew w he whistl in the nutcrack eh troubl behind us and troubl in front of us when do we start he ask as we turn back right after weve eaten i answer there no use put it off how do you feel about it frank like the chief guest at a lynch parti he said curious but none too cheer nor was i i was fill with a fever of scientif curios but i was not cheerfulno we minist to ventnor as well as we could forc open his set jaw thrust a thin rubber tube down past his windpip into his gullet and drop through it a few ounc of the goat milk our own breakfast was silent enough we could not take ruth with us upon our journey that was certain she must stay here with her brother she would be safer in norhala home than where we were go of cours and yet to leav her was most distress after all i wonder was there ani need of both of us take the journey would not one do just as well drake could stay no use of put all our egg in one basket i broach the subject ill go down by myself while you stay and help ruth you can alway follow if i dont turn up in a reason time his indign at this propos was match onli by her own youll go with him dick drake she cri or ill never look at or speak to you again good lord did you think for a minut i wouldnt pain and wrath struggl on his face we go togeth or neither of us goe ruth will be all right here goodwin the onli thing she has ani caus to fear is yurukand hes had his lesson besid shell have the rifl and her pistol and she know how to use them what dye mean by make such a proposit as that his indign burst all bound lame i tri to justifi myself ill be all right said ruth im not afraid of yuruk and none of these thing will hurt menot afternot after her eye fell her lip quiver then she face us steadili dont ask me how i know that she said quiet believ me i do know it i am closer tothem than you two are and if i choos i can call upon that alien strength their master gave me it is for you two that i fear no fear for us drake burst out hastili were norhala littl playth were tabu take it from me ruth id bet my head there isnt one of these thing great or small and no matter how mani that doesnt by this time know all about us well probabl be receiv with demonstr of interest by the populac as welcom guest probabl well find a signwelcom to our cityhung up over the front gate she smile a trifl tremul well come back he said sudden he lean forward put his hand on her shoulder do you think there is anyth that could keep me from come back he whisper she trembl wide eye search deep into his well i broke in a bit uncomfort wed better be start i think as drake doe that were tabu bar accid there no danger and if i guess right about these thing accid is imposs as inconceiv as the multipl tabl go wrong he laugh straighten and so we made readi our rifl would be wors than useless we knew our pistol we decid to carri as drake put it for comfort canteen fill with water a coupl of emerg ration a few instrument includ a small spectroscop a select from the medic kital these pack in a littl haversack which he threw over his broad shoulder i pocket my compact but exceed power field glass to my poignant and everlast regret my camera had been upon the bolt poni and ventnor had long been out of film for his we were readi for our journey our path led straight away a smooth and dark gray road whose surfac resembl cement pack under enorm pressur it was all of fifti feet wide and now in daylight glisten faint as though overlaid with some vitreous coat it narrow abrupt into a wedg way that stop at the threshold of norhala door diminish through the distanc it stretch straight as an arrow onward and vanish between perpendicular cliff which form the frown gateway through which the night befor we had pass upon the cours cube from the pit of the citi here as then a misti check the gaze ruth with us we made a brief inspect of the surround of norhala hous it was set as though in the narrowest portion of an hour glass the precipit wall march inward from the gateway form the lower half of the figur at the back they swung apart at a wider angl this upper part of the hour glass was fill with a park like forest it was close perhap twenti mile away by a barrier of cliff how i wonder did the path which yuruk had point out to me pierc them was it by pass or tunnel and whi was it the armor men had not found and follow it the waist between these two mountain wedg was a valley not more than a mile wide norhala hous stood in it center and it was like a garden dot with flower and fragrant lili and here and there a tini green meadow the great globe of blue that was norhala dwell seem less to rest upon the ground than to emerg from it as though it basic curvatur were hidden in the earth what was it substanc i could not tell it was as though built of the lacquer of the gem whose color it held and beauti wondrous incred beauti it wasan immens bubbl of froth of molten sapphir and turquois we had not time to studi it beauti a few last instruct to ruth and we set forth down the gray road hard had we taken a few step when there came a faint cri from her dick dickcom here he sprang to her caught her hand in his for a moment half frighten it seem she consid him dick i heard her whisper dickcom back safe to me i saw his arm close about her her tighten around his neck black hair touch the silken brown curl their lip met clung i turn away in a littl time he join me head down silent he strode along besid me utter deject a hundr more yard and we turn ruth was still stand on the threshold of the hous of mysteri watch us she wave her hand flit in was hidden from us and drake still silent we push on the wall of the gateway were close the spars veget along the base of the cliff had ceas the roadway itself had merg into the smooth bare floor of the canyon from vertic edg to vertic edg of the rocki portal stretch a curtain of shimmer mist as we drew nearer we saw that this was motionless and less like vapor of water than vapor of light it stream in odd fix line like atom of crystal in a still solut drake thrust an arm within it wave it the mist did not move it seem instead to interpenetr the arma though bone and flesh were spectral without power to dislodg the shine particl from posit we pass within itsid by side instant i knew that whatev these veil were they were not moistur the air we breath was dri electr i was sensibl of a decid stimul a pleasant tingl along everi nerv a gaieti almost light head we could see each other quit plain the rocki floor on which we trod as well within this vapor of light there was no ghost of sound it was utter empti of it i saw drake turn to me his mouth open in a laugh his lip move in speechand although he bent close to my ear i heard noth he frown puzzl and walk on abrupt we step into an open a pocket of clear air our ear were fill with a high shrill hum as unpleas vibrant as the shriek of a sand blast six feet to our right was the edg of the ledg on which we stood beyond it was a sheer drop into space a shaft pierc down into the void and wall with the mist but it was not that shaft that made us clutch each other no it was that through it upros a coloss column of the cube it stood a hundr feet from us it top was anoth hundr feet abov the level of our ledg and it length vanish in the depth and it head was a gigant spin wheel yard in thick taper at it point of contact with the cliff wall into a diamet half that of the side closest the column gleam with flash of green flame and grind with tremend speed at the face of the rock over it attach to the cliff was a great vizor hood of some pale yellow metal and it was this shelter that cut off the vapor light like an enorm umbrella made the pocket of clariti in which we stood the shaft up which sprang the pillar all along the length of that column as far as we could see the myriad tini eye of the metal peopl shone out upon us not twinkl mischiev butgrotesqu as this may seem i cannot help itwid with surpris onli an instant longer did the great wheel spin i saw the scream rock melt beneath it drop like lava then as though it had receiv some messag abrupt it motion now ceas it tilt look down upon us i note that it grind surfac was stud thick with the smaller pyramid and that the tip of these were each cap with what seem to be facet gem gleam with the same pale yellow radianc as the shrine of the cone the column was bend the wheel approach drake seiz me by the arm drew me swift back into the mist we were shroud in their silenc step by step we went on peer for the edg of the shelf feel in fanci that prodigi wheel face steal upon us afraid to look behind lest in look we might step too close to the unseen verg yard after yard we slowli cover sudden the vapor thin we pass out of them a chao of sound beat about us the clang of a million anvil the clamor of a million forg the crash of a hundr year of thunder the roar of a thousand hurrican the prodigi bellow of the pit beat against us now as they had when we had flown down the long ramp into the depth of the sea of light instinct with unthink power was that clamor the veri voic of forc stun nay blind by it we cover ear and eye as befor the clangor die leav in it wake a bewild silenc then that silenc began to throb with a vast hum and through that hum rang a murmur as that of a river of diamond we open our eye felt awe grip our throat as though a hand had clutch them difficult difficult almost beyond thought is it for me now to essay to draw in word the scene befor us then for although i can set down what it was we saw i nor ani man can transmut into phrase it essenc it spirit the intang wonder that was it synthesisth appal beauti soul shake strang of it it grandeur it fantasi and it alien terror the domain of the metal monsterit was fill like a chalic with it will was the visibl express of that will we stood at the veri rim of a wide ledg we look down into an immens pit shape into a perfect oval thirti mile in length i judg and half that as wide and rim with coloss precipic we were at the upper end of this deep valley and on the tip of it axi i mean that it stretch longitudin befor us along the line of greatest length five

caught by some subtl hidden sens higher than sight it was a metal citi mountain andawar about it base were huge open through and around these portal swirl hord of the metal peopl in unit and in combin come and go stream in and out form as they came and went pattern about the open like the fret spume of great breaker surg into retreat from ocean bitten gap in some iron bound coast from the immens of the citi the eye drop back to the pit in which it lay it floor was plaquelik a great plane smooth as though turn by potter wheel broken by no mound nor hillock slope nor terrac level horizont flawless flat on it was no green live thingno tree nor bush meadow nor covert it was aliv with movement a ferment that was as purpos as it was mechan a ferment symmetr geometr suprem order the surg of the

the metal peopl lift themselv in a thousand incred shape shape squar and globe and spike and shift swift into other thousand as incred i saw a mass of them draw themselv up into the like of a tent skyscrap high hang so for an instant then writh into a monstrous chimera of a dozen tower leg that strode away like a gigant headless and bodiless tarantula in step two hundr feet long i watch mile long line of them shape and reshap into circl into interlac lozeng and pentagonsthen lift in great column and shoot through the air in unimagin barrag through all this incess movement i sens plain purpos knew that it was definit activ toward a definit end caught the clear suggest of drill of maneuv and when the shift of the metal hord permit we saw that all the flat floor of the valley was

in truth molten for i caught it swift and polish rush it was no jade it was in truth a river a river run like a write across a pattern plane i look upwardup to the circl peak they were a stupend coronet thrust mile deep into the dazzl sky i rais my glass swept them in color they were an immens and varieg flower with countless multiform petal of stone in outlin they were a ring of fortress built by fantast unknown god up they thrustdom and arch spire and horn pyramid fang and needl here were palisad of burn orang with barbican of incandesc bronz there aiguill of azur rise from bastion of cinnabar red turret of royal purpl obelisk of indigo titan fort whose wall were splash with vermilion with citron yellow and with rust of rubi watch tower of flame scarlet scatter among them were the flash emerald of the glacier and the immens pallid baroqu of the snow field like a diadem the summit ring the pit below them ran the ring of flash amethyst with it aural mist between them lay the vast and pattern flat cover with still symbol and inexplic movement under their summit brood the blue black metal mass of the see citi within circl wall over plain and from the citi hover a cosmic spirit not to be understood by man like an eman of star and space it was yet gem fine and gem hard crystallin and metal lapidesc and conscious down from the ledg where we stood fell a steep ramp similar to that by which in the dark we had descend it drop at an angl of at least forti five degre it surfac was smooth and polish through the mist at our back stole a shine block it paus seem to perk itself spun so that in turn each of it six face took us in i felt myself lift upon it by multitud of littl invis hand saw drake whirl up besid me i move toward himthrough the forc that held us a block swept away from the ledg sway for a moment under us as though we were float in air the pit lay stretch there was a rapid readjust a shift of our two selv upon anoth surfac i look down upon a tremend slender pillar of the cube drop below five hundr feet to the valley floor a column of which the block that held us was the top gone was the whirl wheel that had crown it but i knew this for the grind thing from which we had fled the quest block had been it scout as though curious to know more of us the shape had sought us out through the mist it messeng had caught us deliv us to it the pillar lean overb like that shine pillar that had bridg for us at norhala command the abyss the floor of the valley aros to meet us further and further lean the pillar again there was a rapid shift of us to anoth surfac of the crown cube fast now swept up toward us the valley floor a dizzi cloud my sight there was a littl shock a roll over the thing that had held us we stood upon the floor of the pit and break from the immens and prostrat shaft on whose top we had ridden downward came score upon score of the cube they broke from it disintegr it circl about us curious interest twinkl at us from their deep sparkl point of eye helpless we gaze at those who circl around us then sudden i felt myself lift onc more was toss to the surfac of the nearest block upon it i spun while the tini eye search me then like a human ball it toss me to anoth i caught a glimps of drake tall figur drift through the air the play becam more rapid breathtak it was play i recogn that but it was peril play for us i felt myself as fragil as a doll of glass in the hand of careless children i was toss to a wait cube on the ground not ten feet from me was drake sway dizzili sudden the cube that held me tighten it grip tighten it so that it drew me irresist flat down upon it surfac befor i drop drake bodi leap toward me as though drawn by a lasso he fell at my side then pursu by score of the thing and like some mischiev boy bear off the spoil the block that held us race away straight for an open portal a blaze of incandesc blue flame blind me again as the dazzlement fade i saw drake besid mea skeleton form swift flesh melt back upon him cloth him the cube stop abrupt the host of littl unseen hand rais us slid us gentl over it edg set us upright besid it and it sped away all about us stretch anoth of those vast hall in which on high burn the pale gilt sun between it coloss column stream thousand of the metal folk no longer hurri but quiet deliber sedat we were within the cityeven as ventnor had command chapter xix the citi that was aliv close besid us was one of the cyclopean column we crept to it crouch at it base opposit the drift of the metal peopl strove huddl there to regain our shaken pois like bagatell we felt in that tremend place the weird luminari gleam abov like garland of frozen sun the enigmat host of anim cube and sphere and pyramid troop past they rang in size from shape yard high to giant of thirti feet or more they paid no heed to us did not stop stream on engross in whatev mysteri busi was summon them and after a time their number lessen thin down to wide separ group to straggler then ceas the hall was empti of them as far as the eye could reach the column space stretch i was conscious onc more of that unusu flow of energi through everi vein and nerv follow the crowd said drake do you feel just full of pep and ginger by the way i am awar of the most extraordinari vigor i answer some weird joint he muse look about him wonder if they have ani window this whole place look solid to mewhat i could see of it wonder if well get up against it for air these thing dont need it that sure wonder he broke off stare fascin at the pillar behind us look here goodwin there was a tremor in his voic what do you make of this i follow his point finger look at him inquir the eye he said impati dont you see them the eye in the column and now i saw them the pillar was a pale metal blue in color a trifl darker than the metal folk all within it were the myriad of tini crystallin point that we had grown to know were the receptor of some strang sens of sight but they did not sparkl as did those other they were dull lifeless i touch the surfac it was smooth coolwith none of that subtl warm vital that puls through all the thing with which i had come in contact i shook my head realiz as i did so what a shock the incred possibl he had suggest had given me no i said there is a resembl yes but there is no forc about thisstuff no life besid such a thing is utter incred they might bedorm he suggest stubborn can you see ani mark of their joiningif they are the cube togeth we scan the pillar minut the face seem unbroken continu there was no trace of those thin and shine line that mark the junctur of the cube when they had click togeth to form the bridg of the abyss or that had gleam crosslik upon the back of the combin four upon which we had follow norhala it a sheer imposs it mad to think such a thing drake i exclaim and wonder at my own vehem of denial mayb he shook his head doubt maybebutwelllet be on our way we strode on follow the direct the metal folk had gone clear drake was still doubt at each pillar he hesit scan it close with troubl eye but i have determin dismiss the idea was more interest in the fantast light that flood this column hall with their buttercup radianc they were still and unwink not disk i could see now but globe great and small they float motionless their ray extend rigid and as still as the orb that shed them yet rigid as they were there was noth about either ray or orb that suggest either hard or the metal they were vapor soft as st elmo fire the witch light that cling at time to the spar of ship weird gleam visitor from the invis ocean of atmospher electr when they disappear as they did frequent it was instantan complet with a disconcert sleight of hand final i note though that when they did vanish immedi close to where they had been other orb swam forth with that same astonish abrupt sometim onli one larger it might be than that which had gone sometim a cluster of smaller globe their frozen crocus ray imping what could they be i wonderedhow fix and what the sourc of their light product of electro magnet current and born of the interpenetr of such stream flow abov us such a theori might account for their disappear and reappear shift of the flow that chang the light produc point of contact wireless light if so here was an idea that human scienc might elabor if ever we return to now which way drake broke in upon my muse the hall had end we stood befor a blank wall vanish into the soft mist hide the roof of the chamber i thought we had been go along the way they went i said in amaz so did i he answer we must have circl they never went through that unlessunless he hesit unless what i ask sharpli unless it open and let them through he said have you forgotten those great ovalslik cat eye that open in the outer wall he ad quiet i had forgotten i look again at the wall certain it was smooth lineless in one unbroken shine surfac it rose a facad of polish metal within it the deep set point of light were duller even than they had been in the pillar almost inde indistinguish go on to the left i said none too patient and get that absurd notion out of your head all right he flush but you dont think im afraid do you if what your think were true youd have a right to be i repli tart and i want to tell you id be afraid damn afraid for perhap two hundr pace we skirt the base of the wall we came abrupt to an open an oblong passageway fulli fifti foot wide by twice as high at it entranc the mellow saffron light was cut off as though by an invis screen the tunnel itself was fill with a dim grayish blue luster for an instant we contempl it i wouldnt care to be caught in there by ani rush i hesit there not much good in think of that now said drake grim a few chanc more or less in a joint of this kind is noth between friend goodwin take it from me come on we enter wall floor and roof were compos of the same substanc as the great pillar the wall of the outer chamber fill like them with dim replica of the twinkl eye point odd that all the place in here are squar mutter drake they dont seem to have use ani spheric or pyramid idea in their buildingif it is a build it was true all was mathemat straight up and down and across it was strangestil we had seen littl as yet there was a warmth about this passageway we trod a differ in the air of it the warmth grew a dri and bake heat but stimul rather than oppress i touch the wall the warmth did not come from them and there was no wind yet as we went on the heat increas the passageway turn at a right angl continu in a corridor half it former dimens far away shone a high bar of pale yellow radianc rise like a pillar of light from floor to roof toward it perforc we trudg it brillianc grew greater a few pace away from it we stop the yellow luminesc stream through a slit not more than a foot wide in the wall we were in a cul de sac for the open was not wide enough for either drake or me to push through through it with the light gush the curious heat envelop us drake walk to the open peer through i join him at first all that i could see was a space fill with the saffron lambenc then i saw that this was splash with tini flash of the jewel fire littl lanc and javelin thrust of burn emerald and rubi dart gem hard flame rose scarlet and pale sapphir quick flare of violet into my sight through the iris crocus mist swam the radiant bodi of norhala she stood nake clad onli in the veil of her hair that glow now like spun silk of molten copper her strang eye wide and smile the galaxi of tini star sparkl through their gray depth and all about her swirl a countless host of the littl thing from them came the gem fire pierc the aureat mist they play and frolick about her in score of swift form swift chang goblin shape they circl her feet in shine elfin ring then open into flame disk and star shot up and spun about the white miracl of her bodi in great girdl of multi color live fire mingl with disk and star were tini cross gleam with sullen deep crimson and smoki orang a flash of blue incandesc and a slender pillar shape leap from the floor becam a coronet a whirl flash halo toward which stream up the flame tendril of her tress other halo circl her arm and breast they spun like bracelet about the outstretch arm then like a swift rush wave a host of the littl thing thrust themselv up cover her hid her in a corusc cloud i saw an exquisit arm thrust itself from their cling wave gaili saw her glorious head emerg from the incred the seeth draperi of live jewel i heard her laughter sweet and golden and far away goddess of the inexplic madonna of the metal babe the nurseri of the metal peopl norhala was gone blot out from our sight gone too were the bar of light and the chamber into which we had been peer we stare at a smooth blank wall with that same ensorcel swift the wall had close even as we had stare through it close so quick that we had not seen it motion i grip drake shrank with him into the farthest cornerfor on the other side of us the wall was open first it was onli a crack then rapid it widen there stretch anoth passageway lumin and long far down it we glimps movement closer that movement came grew plainer out of the mistili lumin distanc three abreast and fill the corridor from side to side race upon us a compani of the great sphere back we cower from their approachback and back arm outstretch press against the barrier flatten ourselv against the shock of the destroy impact menac it all up mutter drake no place to run theyr bound to smash us stick close doc get back to ruth mayb i can stop them befor i could check him he had leap straight in the path of the rush globe now a scant twoscor yard away the globe stoppedhalt a few feet from him they seem to contempl us astonish they turn upon themselv as though consult slowli they advanc we were push forward and lift gentl then as we hung suspend held by that forc which alway i can liken onli to myriad of tini invis hand the shine arc of their back undul beneath us their file swung around the corner and march down the passag by which we had come from the immens hall and when the last rank had pass from under us we were drop soft to our feet stood sway in their wake a curious frenzi of helpless indign shook me a rage of humili obscur all gratitud i should have felt for our escap drake eye blaze wrath the insol devil he rais clench fist the insol domin devil we stare after them was the passag grow narrowerclos even as i gaze i saw it shrink saw it wall slide silent toward each other i push drake into the newli open way and sprang after him behind us was an unbroken wall cover all that space in which but a moment befor we had stood is it to be wonder that a panic seiz us that we began to run crazili down the alley that still lay open befor us cast over our shoulder quick fear glanc to see whether that inexor dread close was continu threaten to crush us between these wall like fli in a vise of steel but they did not close unbroken silent the way stretch befor us and behind us at last gasp avoid each other gaze we paus and at that veri moment of paus a deeper tremor shook me a trembl of the veri foundat of life the shudder of one who face the inconceiv know at last that the inconceivablei for abrupt wall and floor and roof broke forth into countless twinkl as though a

like frighten children each other hand then drake stop by all the hell of this place he said solemn ill run no more after allwer men if they kill us they kill us but by the god who made me ill run from them no more ill die stand his courag steadi me defiant we march on up from below us down from the roof out from the wall of our way the host of eye gleam and twinkl upon us who could have believ

with a look of stupefi amaz which at anoth time i would have found laughabl he obey hold them to my eye i order three minut had gone by there it wasthat for which i sought clear through the darken lens i could see the sun spot high up on the northern most limb of the sun an unimagin cyclon of incandesc gase an unthink huge dynamo pour it flood of electro magnet upon all the circl planet that solar crater which we now know was when at it maximum all of one hundr and fifti thousand mile across the great sun spot of the summer of 1919the most enorm ever record by astronom scienc five minut had gone by common sens whisper to me there was no use keep my eye fix to the glass even if that thought were trueeven if that pillar of radianc were a messeng an earth hurl bolt fli to the sun through atmospher and outer space with the speed of light even if it were this stupend creation of these thing still between eight and nine minut must elaps befor it could reach the orb and as mani minut must go by befor the imag of whatev it impact might produc upon the sun could pass back over the bridg of light span the nineti million of mile between it and us and after all did not that hypothesi belong to the utter imposs even were it sowhat was it that the metal monster expect to follow this radiant shaft coloss as it was to us was infinitesim compar to the target at which it was aim what possibl effect could that spear have upon the solar forc and yetand yeta gnat bite can drive an eleph mad and natur balanc is delic and what great happen may follow the slightest disturb of her infinit sensit her complex equilibrium it might beit might be eight minut had pass take the glass i bade drake look up at the sun spotth big one i see it he had obey me what of it nine minut the shaft if i were right had by now touch the sun what was to follow i dont get you at all said drake and lower the glass ten minut what happen look at the cone look at the emperor gasp drake i peer down then almost forgot to count the pyramid flame that had been the mount of cone was shrunken the pillar of radianc had not lessenedbut the mechan that was it sourc had retreat whole yard within the

watch build it outward or whether it was a properti inher with the substanc itself i do not know certain there was no mark upon it to show where the molten mist had fallen it was diamond hard and smooth the nearest cone were but a scant nine feet from it rim sudden we saw the tablet stood besid it the shape of a great t glimmer with a faint and limpid violet phosphoresc it might have been in

us open the crater of the cone through the torn gap i saw them cluster undisturb about the base of that one slender coronet and star point spire rise seren and unshaken from a hell of lightn but the shield that had rim the crater were gone ventnor snatch the glass from my hand level and held them long to his eye he thrust them back to me look through the lens the great hall leap into full view appar onli a few yard away it was a cauldron of chameleon flame it seeth with the hord battl over the remain wall and floor but around the crystal base of the cone was an open zone into which none broke in that wide ring girdl the shimmer fantasi like a circl sanctuari were but three form one was the wondrous disk of jewel fire i have call the metal emperor the second was the sullen fire cruciform of the keeper the third was norhala she stood at the side of that weird master of hersor was it after all the servant between them and the keeper plane gleam the gigant t shape tablet of countless rod which control the activ of the cone that had control the shift of the vanish shield that manipul too perhap the energi of whatev similar but smaller cornut ganglia were scatter throughout the citi and one of which we had beheld when the emperor guard had blast ventnor close was norhala in the lensesso close that almost it seem i could reach out and touch her the flame hair stream and billow abov her glorious head like a banner of molten floss of copperi gold her face was a mask of wrath and despair her great eye blaze upon the keeper her exquisit bodi was bare strip of everi shred of silken cover from stream tress to white feet an oval of puls golden light nimbus her maiden isi virgin astart she stood there held in the grip of the disklik a goddess betray and hopeless yet thirst for vengeanc for all their still their immobl it came to me that emperor and keeper were at grappl lock in death grip the realize was as definit as though like ruth i thought with norhala mind saw with her eye clear too it came to me that in this contest between the two was epitom all the vast conflict that rage around them that in it was fast ripen that fruit of destini of which ventnor had spoken and that here in the hall of the cone would be settledand soonth fate not onli of disk and cross but it might be of human but with what unknown power was that duel be fought they cast no lightn they battl with no visibl weapon onli the great plane of the invert cruciform shape smoke and smolder with their sullen flare of ochr and of scarlet while over all the face of the disk it cold and iris fire race and shone beat with a rhythm incred rapid it core of incandesc rubi blaze it sapphir oval were cabochon pool of live lucent radianc there was a split roar that aros abov all the clamor deafen us even in the shelter of the silent veil on each side of the crater whole mass of the citi drop away fleet i was awar of score of smaller pit in which upros lesser replica of the cone mount lesser reservoir of the monster forc neither the emperor nor the keeper move both seem indiffer to the catastroph fast develop around them now i strain forward to the veri thinnest edg of the curtain for between the disk and cross began to form fine black mist it was transpar it seem spun of minut transluc ebon corpuscl it hung like a black shroud suspend by unseen hand it shook and waver now toward the disk now toward the cross i sens a key up of forc within the two knew that each was strive to cast like a net that hang mist upon the other abrupt the emperor flash forth blind as though caught upon a blast the black shroud flew toward the keeperenvelop it and as the mist cover and clung i saw the sulphur and crimson flare dim they were snuf out the keeper fell upon norhala face flame a wild triumph banish despair the outstretch plane of the cross swept up as though in torment for an instant it fire flare and lick through the cling black it writh half upright threw itself forward crash down prostrat upon the enigmat tablet which onli it tentacl could manipul from norhala face the triumph fled on it heel rush stark incredul horror the mount of cone shudder from it came a singl mighti throb of forcelik a prodigi heart beat under that puls of power the emperor stagger spunand spin swept norhala from her feet swung her close to it flash rose a second throb puls from the cone and mightier a spasm shook the diska paroxysm it fire fade they flare out again bath the float unearth figur of norhala with their iridesc i saw her bodi writhea though it share the

anoth outfit there ruth he said well take a turn through the place call us when your readi well get someth to eat and go see what happeningout there she nod we pass through the curtain and out of the hall into the chamber that had been norhala there we halt drake eye martin with a certain embarrass the older man thrust out his hand to him i knew it drake he said ruth told me all about it when cherki had us and im veri glad it time she was have a home of her own and not run around the lost place with me ill miss hermiss her damnabl of cours but im glad boyglad there was a littl silenc while each look deep into each other heart then ventnor drop dick hand and that all of that he said the problem befor us ishow are we go to get back home thethingi dead i spoke from an absolut convict that surpris me base as it was upon no realli tangibl known evid i think so he said noi know so yet even if we can pass over it bodi how can we climb out of it lair that slide down which we rode with norhala is unclimb the wall are unscal and there is that chasmshespan for us how can we cross that the tunnel to the ruin was seal there remain of possibl road the way through the forest to what was the citi of cherki frank i am loath to take it i am not at all sure that all the armor men were slainthat some few may not have escap and be lurk there it would be short shrift for us if we fell into their hand now and im not sure of that object drake i think their pep and push must be pretti thorough knock outif ani do remain i think if they saw us come theyd beat it so fast that theyd smoke with the friction there someth to that ventnor smile still im not keen on take the chanc at ani rate the first thing to do is to see what happen down there in the pit mayb well have some other idea after that i know what happen there announc drake surpris it was a short circuit we gape at him mystifi burn out said drake everi damn one of themburn out what were they after all a lot of live dynamo dynamotorsrath and all of a sudden they had too much juic turn on bang went their insulationswhatev they were bang went they burn outshort circuit i dont pretend to know whi or how nonsens i do know

distress pagan clad maid we saw as we pass back into the room of the pool in knickerbock and short skirt prim and self possess rebelli curl held sever in place by close fit cap and slender feet stout shod ruth hover over the steam kettl swung abov the spirit lamp and she was veri silent as we hastili broke fast nor when we had finish did she go to drake she clung close to her brother and besid him as we set forth down the roadway through the rain toward the ledg between the cliff where the veil had shimmer hotter and hotter it grew as we advanc the air steam like a turkish bath the mist cluster so thick that at last we grope forward step by step hold to each other no use gasp ventnor we couldnt see well have to turn back burn out said dick didnt i tell you the whole valley was a volcano and with that delug fall in itwhi wouldnt there be a fog it whi there is a fog well have to wait until it clear we trudg back to the blue globe all that day the rain fell throughout the few remain hour of daylight we wander over the hous of norhala examin it most interest content or sat theoriz discuss all phase of the phenomena we had wit we told ruth what had occur after she had thrown in her lot with norhala and of the enigmat struggl between the glorious disk and the sullen flame thing i have call the keeper we told her of the entomb of norhala when she heard that she wept she was sweet she sob she was love and she was beauti dear she love me i know she love me oh i know that we and our and that which was her could not share the world togeth but it come to me that earth would have been far less poison with those that were norhala than it is with us and our weep she pass through the curtain go we knew to norhala chamber it was a strang thing inde that she had said i thought watch her go that the garden of the world would be far less poison blossom with those thing of wed crystal and metal and magnet fire than fertil as now with us of flesh and blood and bone to me came appreci of their harmoni and mingl with those percept were other of humanitydisharmoni incoordin ever struggl ever strive to destroy itself there was a plaintiv whinni at the open door a long and hairi face a pair of patient inquir eye look in it was a poni for a moment it regard usand then trot trust through ambl up to us poke it head against my side it had been ridden by one of the persian whom ruth had kill for under it slip from the girth a saddl dangl and it owner must have been kind to itw knew that from it lack of fear for us driven by the tempest of the night befor it had been led back by instinct to the protect of man some luck breath drake he busi himself with the poni strip away the hang saddl groom it chapter xxxi slag that night we slept well awaken we found that the storm had grown violent again the wind roar and the rain fall in such volum that it was imposs to make our way to the pit twice as a matter of fact we tri but the smooth roadway was a torrent and drench even through our oil to the skin we at last abandon the attempt ruth and drake drift away togeth among the other chamber of the globe they were absorb in themselv and we did not thrust ourselv upon them all the day the torrent fell we sat down that night to what was well nigh the last of ventnor store seem ruth had forgotten norhala at least she spoke no more of her martin she said cant we start back tomorrow i want to get away i want to get back to our own world as soon as the storm ceas ruth he answer we start littl sisteri too want you to get back quick the next morn the storm had gone we awaken soon after dawn into clear and brilliant light we had a silent and hurri breakfast the saddlebag were pack and strap upon the poni within them were what we could carri of souvenir from norhala homea suit of lacquer armor a pair of cloak and sandal the jewel comb ruth and drake at the side of the poni ventnor and i lead we set forth toward the pit well probabl have to come back walter he said i dont believ the place is passabl i pointedw were then just over the threshold of the elfin globe where the veil had stretch between the perpendicular pillar of the cliff was now a wide and rag edg open the roadway which had run so smooth through the scarp was block by a thousand foot barrier over it beyond it i could see through the crystallin clariti of the air the oppos wall we can climb it ventnor said we pass on and reach the base of the barrier an avalanch had drop there the barricad was the debri of the torn cliff their dust their pebbl their boulder we toil up we reach the crest we look down upon the valley when first we had seen it we had gaze upon a sea of radianc pierc with lanc forest swept with gigant gonfalon of flame we had seen it empti of it fieri mistsa vast slate cover with the chirographi of a mathemat god we had seen it fill with the symbol of the metal hord and domin by the coloss integr hieroglyph of the live citi we had seen it as a radiant lake over which brood weird sun a lake of yellow flame froth upon which a sparkl hail fell within which rear island tower and a drown mount run with cataract of sun fire here we had watch a goddess woman a be half of earth half of the unknown immur within a live tomba die tombof flame mysteri had seen a cross shape metal satan a sullen flame crystal juda betrayitself where we had peer into the unfathom had glimps the infinit had heard and had seen the inexplic now was slag the amethystin ring from which had been stream the circl veil was crack and blacken like a seam of coal it had stretch around the

there black hillock sprawl huge pillar aros bent and twist as though they had been jet of lava cool into rigid befor they could sink back or break these shape cluster most thick around an immens calcifi mound they were what were left of the battl hord and the mound was what had been the metal monster somewher there were the ash of norhala seal by fire in the urn of the metal emperor from side

still fill with water littl wreath of steam drift in those futil wraith of vapor was all that remain of the might of the metal monster catastroph i had expect tragedi i knew we would findbut i had look for noth so fill with the abomin of desol so fright as was this burn out mutter drake short circuit and burn out like a dynamolik an electr light destini said ventnor destini not yet was the hour struck for man to relinquish his sovereignti over the world destini we began to pick our way down the heap debri and out upon the plain for all that day and part of anoth we search for an open out of the pit everywher was the incred calcif the surfac that had been the smooth metal carapac with the tini eye deep within them crumbl beneath the lightest blow not long would it be until under wind and rain they dissolv into dust and mud and it grew increas obvious that drake theori of the destruct was correct the monster had been one prodigi magnetor rather a prodigi dynamo by magnet by electr it had live and had been activ whatev the forc of which the cone were built and that i have liken to energi made materi it was certain akin to electromagnet energi when in the cataclysm that forc was diffus there had been creat a magnet field of incred intens had been concentr an electr charg of inconceiv magnitud discharg it had blast the monstershort circuit it and burn it out but what was it that had led up to the cataclysm what was it that had turn the metal monster upon itself what disharmoni had crept into that supern order to set in motion the machineri of disintegr we could onli conjectur the cruciform shape i have name the keeper was the agent of destructionof that there could be no doubt in the enigmat organ which while mani still was one and which retain it integr as a whole could dissoci manifold part yet still as a whole maintain an unseen contact and direct over them through mile of space the keeper had it place it work it duti so too had that wondrous disk whose visibl and concentr power whose manifest leadership had made us name it emperor and had not norhala call the diskrul what were the respons of these twain to the mass of the organ of which they were such import unit what were the law they administ the law they must obey someth certain of that mysteri law which maeterlinck has call the spirit of the hiveand someth infinit greater like that which govern the swarm sun bee of hercul cluster orb had there evolv within the keeper of the conesguardian and engin as it seem to have beenambit had there risen within it a determin to wrest power from the disk to take it place as ruler how els explain that conflict i had sens when the emperor had pluck drake and me from the keeper grip that night follow the orgi of the feed how els explain that duel in the shatter hall of the cone whose end had been the signal for the final cataclysm how els explain the alin of the cube behind the keeper against the globe and pyramid remain loyal to the will of the disk we discuss this ventnor and i this world he muse is a place of struggl air and sea and land and all thing that dwell within and on them must battl for life earth not mar is the planet of war i have a theoryh hesitatedthat the magnet current which are the nerv forc of this globe of our were what fed the metal thing within those current is the spirit of earth and alway they have been supercharg with strife with hatr warfar were these drawn in by the thing as they fed did it happen that the keeper becametunedto them that it absorb and respond to them grow even more sensit to these forcesuntil it reflect human who know goodwinwho can tell enigma unless the explan i have hazard be accept must remain that monstrous suicid enigma save for inconclus theori must remain the question of the monster origin if answer there were they were lost forev in the slag we trod it was afternoon of the second day that we found a rift in the blast wall of the valley we decid to tri it we had not dare to take the road by which norhala had led us into the citi the giant slide was broken and climbabl but even if we could have pass safe through the tunnel of the abyss there still was left the chasm over which we could have thrown no bridg and if we could have bridg it still at that road end was the cliff whose shaft norhala had seal with her lightn so we enter the rift of our wander thereaft i need not write from the rift we emerg into a maze of the valley and after a month in that wilder live upon what game we could shoot we found a road that led us into gyants in anoth six week we were home in america my stori is finish there in the tran himalayan wilder is the blue globe that was the weird home of the lightn witchand look back i feel now she could not have been all woman there is the vast pit with it coronet of fantast peak it symbol calcin floor and the crumbl bodi of the inexplic the incred thing which aliv was the shadow of extinct annihil hover to hurl itself upon human that shadow is gone that pall withdrawn but to meto each of us four who saw those phenomenatheir lesson remain ineradic give a new strength and purpos to us teach us a new humil for in that vast crucibl of life of which we are so small a part what other shape may even now be rise to submerg us in that vast reservoir of forc that is the mysteri fill infinit through which we roll what other shadow may be speed upon us who know
