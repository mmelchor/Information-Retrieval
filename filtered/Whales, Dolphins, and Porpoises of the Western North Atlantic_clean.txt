speci may vari from local to local and even from individu to individu some person argu for the use of the term porpois for all small cetacean other insist on the term dolphin still other either random use the term or call member of the famili delphinida dolphin and member of the famili phocoenida porpois the evid support ani one of these posit is confus at best and no usag of term appear to be without problem we see no wholli satisfactori resolut to the problem at this time for all these reason we have littl desir to defend our decis to follow the last of these practic in this guid refer to all member of the famili delphinida for which the term dolphin or porpois appear in the common name as dolphin and to the one member of the famili phocoenida repres in the western north atlant phocoena phocoena as the harbor porpois although all cetacean may be regard as whale the term whale most common appli to the larger anim for all speci treat other common name by which they may be known are also list detail treatment of the relat merit of the various terminolog is inappropri here furthermor it is our opinion that the usag of the term dolphin porpois and whale as part of the common name of cetacean is larg a matter of person prefer organ of the guid the differ between baleen and tooth whale are easi enough to see in anim wash up on the beach or maintain in a tank at a zoo or aquarium but sinc an anim at sea can seldom be examin that close it most obvious characterist may be it overal size the presenc or absenc of a dorsal fin it promin color or mark it general behavior or it swim blow and dive characterist for that reason regardless of their scientif relationship all the whale dolphin and the one porpois cover in the main text of this guid are divid into three group those over 40 feet 122 m long are discuss in the section on larg whale those from 13 to 40 feet 40 to 122 m in the medium size whale and those less than 13 feet 40 m in the small whale dolphin and

are preced by a directori to speci account which is a summari of the most obvious characterist of each speci and in which summari statement about each characterist are arrang in parallel order to use the guid to identifi live anim observ at sea a person or person should 1 first estim the anim size and determin whether or not it has a dorsal fin 2 note also ani distinct featur of bodi shape and color and observ it general behavior includ swim blow and dive characterist it should be note that color may vari somewhat at sea depend on light condit and water clariti for exampl anim which appear dark gray or black at the surfac or when dead may appear brown in good light or when submerg make a brief sketch at this point may aid in identifi the anim or in later recal it distinct featur 3 use the directori locat the section to which the anim probabl belong 4 then for more detail inform consult the section indic there you will find a more complet discuss of the anim rang size and distinct characterist in addit you will find a brief discuss distinguish it from anim with which it is like to be confus in the field this guid will probabl work best if in advanc of attempt to use the key in the field the reader will familiar himself with the general outlin with charact or behavior to note and with the locat of the various speci account it will also help if he school himself to ask a seri of question about the anim he see at the time of the encount rather than depend on his recal at a later time see p 160 as we have emphas sever time in this guid posit identif of cetacean at sea can onli occasion be made on the basi of a singl characterist therefor the greater the amount of pertin evid an observ obtain the greater the likelihood he can make a reliabl identif to identifi strand anim strand anim can best be identifi by refer to appendix c and it associ tabl make a preliminari determin and then consult the speci account in the main bodi of the book for verif of the identif as note in that appendix if the anim is recent strand identif can be made use ani of the extern visibl characterist describ for the live speci at sea but even if the anim is in an advanc stage of

reason though the reason suggest for these strand appear almost as numer as the strand themselv two tenabl general have recent been propos strand of lone individu usual involv an anim which is sick or injur mass strand involv from sever to sever hundr individu appear to be far more complex and may result from fear reaction from extrem bad weather condit from herd wide diseas condit or from failur of the echoloc system due to physiolog problem or environment condit which combin to reduc it effect to mention onli a few whatev their caus howev cetacean strand usual attract crowd and elicit much public interest and sympathi there are frequent attempt to save the live of the anim involv individu strand cetacean rare surviv even if they are found soon after strand and transport to adequ hold facil this doe not mean that everi attempt should not be made to save them in mass strand some individu may be entir healthi and if they are found soon enough after strand proper protect and transport and correct care for in the initi few day after collect they may surviv in captiv attempt to rescu all the anim in a mass strand by tow them out to sea have almost alway been frustrat becaus the anim usual swim repeat back onto the beach if you discov a strand and befor you becom involv in an attempt to save a live strand anim or to collect data from a dead one you should be awar of the follow marin mammal are current protect by law under provis of the marin mammal protect act of 1972 it is unlaw for person without a permit to handl harass or possess ani marin mammal it is within the author of state offici and employe of the nation marin fisheri servic to arrang for the care of live anim through certifi institut such as mani of those list in appendix e even if the anim were not protect by law ani impuls to take them to backyard swim pool for instanc should be temper by the knowledg that their chanc of surviv are far greater in an institut with the facil and expertis to proper care for them the best general rule is to notifi the nearest state or nation marin fisheri servic offic if you prefer howev you may contact one of the institut list in the appendix and ask them to handl the situat some will alreadi have permit to investig strand most will be anxious to help although you cannot remov the anim from the beach without a permit you can help keep it aliv until it can be remov here are a few hint while wait for help to arriv endeavor to keep the anim as comfort as possibl if it is not too larg and surf condit permit it should be remov to shallow water where it is bare afloat the buoyanc of the water will reduc the stress to the anim and will help to keep it cool and prevent overheatinga real danger to strand cetacean whether or not the anim can be float care should be taken to protect it from sunburn dri out and overh if it is afloat expos part should be frequent splash down if it is high and dri it should be cover with damp cloth particular on the dorsal fin flipper and fluke and the bodi and the terrain should be frequent water to prevent the anim from overh in the area in contact with the sand or rock in ani case be care to leav the blowhol free so that the anim can breath note also that the eye are particular sensit and suscept to injuri they should be cover with a wet cloth and treat with special care with luck this care handl will be reward with the anim be pick up and transport to an aquarium where it can receiv proper attent but even if the anim cannot be save collect and examin of the carcass can provid valuabl inform to scientist work on the biolog of cetacean or on such problem as their diseas condit and the effect of environment pollut on them dead strand cetacean even in advanc stage of decomposit are also an import sourc of materi for museum studi and display therefor everi attempt should be made to get the carcass into the best hand dead cetacean like the live one are protect by law and may not be remov without a permit the procedur for obtain permiss to collect them is the same as that outlin for live strand the major of the institut along the western north atlant coast will respond to call about live or dead strand
