long while to us allth three day of his absenceand often did littl cathi ask when he would be home mrs earnshaw expect him by supper time on the third even and she put the meal off hour after hour there were no sign of his come howev and at last the children got tire of run down to the gate to look then it grew dark she would have had them to bed but they beg sad to be allow to stay up and just about eleven oclock the door latch was rais quiet and in step the master he threw himself into a chair laugh and groan and bid them all stand off for he was near killedh would not have such anoth walk for the three kingdom and at the end of it to be flight to death he said open his great coat which he held bundl up in his arm see here wife i was never so beaten with anyth in my life but you must een take it as a gift of god though it as dark almost as if it came from the devil we crowd round and over miss cathi head i had a peep at a dirti rag black hair child big enough both to walk and talk inde it face look older than catherin yet when it was set on it feet it onli stare round and repeat over and over again some gibberish that nobodi could understand i was frighten and mrs earnshaw was readi to fling it out of door she did fli up ask how he could fashion to bring that gipsi brat into the hous when they had their own bairn to feed and fend for what he meant to do with it and whether he were mad the master tri to explain the matter but he was realli half dead with fatigu and all that i could make out amongst her scold was a tale of his see it starv and houseless and as good as dumb in the street of liverpool where he pick it up and inquir for it owner not a soul knew to whom it belong he said and his money and time be both limit he thought it better to take it home with him at onc than run into vain expens there becaus he was determin he would not leav it as he found it well the conclus was that my mistress grumbl herself calm and mr earnshaw told me to wash it and give it clean thing and let it sleep with the children hindley and cathi content themselv with look and listen till peac was restor then both began search their father pocket for the present he had promis them the former was a boy of fourteen but when he drew out what had been a fiddl crush to morsel in the great coat he blubber aloud and cathi when she learn the master had lost her whip in attend on the stranger show her humour by grin and spit at the stupid littl thing earn for her pain a sound blow from her father to teach her cleaner manner they entir refus to have it in bed with them or even in their room and i had no more sens so i put it on the land of the stair hope it might be gone on the morrow by chanc or els attract by hear his voic it crept to mr earnshaw door and there he found it on quit his chamber inquiri were made as to how it got there i was oblig to confess and in recompens for my cowardic and inhuman was sent out of the hous this was heathcliff first introduct to the famili on come back a few day afterward for i did not consid my banish perpetu i found they had christen him heathcliff it was the name of a son who die in childhood and it has serv him ever sinc both for christian and surnam miss cathi and he were now veri thick but hindley hate him and to say the truth i did the same and we plagu and went on with him shame for i wasnt reason enough to feel my injustic and the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him wrong he seem a sullen patient child harden perhap to ill treatment he would stand hindley blow without wink or shed a tear and my pinch move him onli to draw in a breath and open his eye as if he had hurt himself by accid and nobodi was to blame this endur made old earnshaw furious when he discov his son persecut the poor fatherless child as he call him he took to heathcliff strang believ all he said for that matter he said precious littl and general the truth and pet him up far abov cathi who was too mischiev and wayward for a favourit so from the veri begin he bred bad feel in the hous and at mrs earnshaw death which happen in less than two year after the young master had learn to regard his father as an oppressor rather than a friend and heathcliff as a usurp of his parent affect and his privileg and he grew bitter with brood over these injuri i sympathis a while but when the children fell ill of the measl and i had to tend them and take on me the care of a woman at onc i chang my idea heathcliff was danger sick and while he lay at the worst he would have me constant by his pillow i suppos he felt i did a good deal for him and he hadnt wit to guess that i was compel to do it howev i will say this he was the quietest child that ever nurs watch over the differ between him and the other forc me to be less partial cathi and her brother harass me terribl he was as uncomplain as a lamb though hard not gentl made him give littl troubl he got through and the doctor affirm it was in a great measur owe to me and prais me for my care i was vain of his commend and soften toward the be by whose mean i earn them and thus hindley lost his last alli still i couldnt dote on heathcliff and i wonder often what my master saw to admir so much in the sullen boy who never to my recollect repaid his indulg by ani sign of gratitud he was not insol to his benefactor he was simpli insens though know perfect the hold he had on his heart and conscious he had onli to speak and all the hous would be oblig to bend to his wish as an instanc i rememb mr earnshaw onc bought a coupl of colt at the parish fair and gave the lad each one heathcliff took the handsomest but it soon fell lame and when he discov it he said to hindley you must exchang hors with me i dont like mine and if you wont i shall tell your father of the three thrash youv given me this week and show him my arm which is black to the shoulder hindley put out his tongu and cuf him over the ear youd better do it at onc he persist escap to the porch they were in the stabl you will have to and if i speak of these blow youll get them again with interest off dog cri hindley threaten him with an iron weight use for weigh potato and hay throw it he repli stand still and then ill tell how you boast that you would turn me out of door as soon as he die and see whether he will not turn you out direct hindley threw it hit him on the breast and down he fell but stagger up immedi breathless and white and had not i prevent it he would have gone just so to the master and got full reveng by let his condit plead for him intim who had caus it take my colt gipsi then said young earnshaw and i pray that he may break your neck take him and be damn you beggar interlop and wheedl my father out of all he has onli afterward show him what you are imp of satanand take that i hope hell kick out your brain heathcliff had gone to loos the beast and shift it to his own stall he was pass behind it when hindley finish his speech by knock him under it feet and without stop to examin whether his hope were fulfil ran away as fast as he could i was surpris to wit how coolli the child gather himself up and went on with his intent exchang saddl and all and then sit down on a bundl of hay to overcom the qualm which the violent blow occas befor he enter the hous i persuad him easili to let me lay the blame of his bruis on the hors he mind littl what tale was told sinc he had what he want he complain so seldom inde of such stir as these that i realli thought him not vindict i was deceiv complet as you will hear chapter v in the cours of time mr earnshaw began to fail he had been activ and healthi yet his strength left him sudden and when he was confin to the chimney corner he grew grievous irrit a noth vex him and suspect slight of his author near threw him into fit this was especi to be remark if ani one attempt to impos upon or domin over his favourit he was pain jealous lest a word should be spoken amiss to him seem to have got into his head the notion that becaus he like heathcliff all hate and long to do him an ill turn it was a disadvantag to the lad for the kinder among us did not wish to fret the master so we humour his partial and that humour was rich nourish to the child pride and black temper still it becam in a manner necessari twice or thrice hindley manifest of scorn while his father was near rous the old man to a furi he seiz his stick to strike him and shook with rage that he could not do it at last our curat we had a curat then who made the live answer by teach the littl linton and earnshaw and farm his bit of land himself advis that the young man should be sent to colleg and mr earnshaw agre though with a heavi spirit for he saidhindley was nought and would never thrive as where he wander i hope heartili we should have peac now it hurt me to think the master should be made uncomfort by his own good deed i fanci the discont of age and diseas aros from his famili disagr as he would have it that it did realli you know sir it was in his sink frame we might have got on toler notwithstand but for two peoplemiss cathi and joseph the servant you saw him i daresay up yonder he was and is yet most like the wearisomest self righteous pharise that ever ransack a bibl to rake the promis to himself and fling the curs to his neighbour by his knack of sermonis and pious discours he contriv to make a great impress on mr earnshaw and the more feebl the master becam the more influenc he gain he was relentless in worri him about his soul concern and about rule his children rigid he encourag him to regard hindley as a reprob and night after night he regular grumbl out a long string of tale against heathcliff and catherin alway mind to flatter earnshaw weak by heap the heaviest blame on the latter certain she had way with her such as i never saw a child take up befor and she put all of us past our patienc fifti time and often in a day from the hour she came down stair till the hour she went to bed we had not a minut secur that she wouldnt be in mischief her spirit were alway at high water mark her tongu alway goingsing laugh and plagu everybodi who would not do the same a wild wick slip she wasbut she had the bonniest eye the sweetest smile and lightest foot in the parish and after all i believ she meant no harm for when onc she made you cri in good earnest it seldom happen that she would not keep you compani and oblig you to be quiet that you might comfort her she was much too fond of heathcliff the greatest punish we could invent for her was to keep her separ from him yet she got chide more than ani of us on his account in play she like exceed to act the littl mistress use her hand freeli and command her companion she did so to me but i would not bear slap and order and so i let her know now mr earnshaw did not understand joke from his children he had alway been strict and grave with them and catherin on her part had no idea whi her father should be crosser and less patient in his ail condit than he was in his prime his peevish reproof waken in her a naughti delight to provok him she was never so happi as when we were all scold her at onc and she defi us with her bold sauci look and her readi word turn joseph religi curs into ridicul bait me and do just what her father hate mostshow how her pretend insol which he thought real had more power over heathcliff than his kind how the boy would do her bid in anyth and his onli when it suit his own inclin after behav as bad as possibl all day she sometim came fondl to make it up at night nay cathi the old man would say i cannot love thee thourt wors than thi brother go say thi prayer child and ask god pardon i doubt thi mother and i must rue that we ever rear thee that made her cri at first and then be repuls continu harden her and she laugh if i told her to say she was sorri for her fault and beg to be forgiven but the hour came at last that end mr earnshaw troubl on earth he die quiet in

more but what do you mean by a chang mr heathcliff i said alarm at his manner though he was neither in danger of lose his sens nor die accord to my judgment he was quit strong and healthi and as to his reason from childhood he had a delight in dwell on dark thing and entertain odd fanci he might have had a monomania on the subject of his depart idol but on everi other point his wit were as sound

till i was inclin to believ as he said joseph did that conscienc had turn his heart to an earth hell i wonder great how it would end though he seldom befor had reveal this state of mind even by look it was his habitu mood i had no doubt he assert it himself but not a soul from his general bear would have conjectur the fact you did not when you saw him mr lockwood and at the period of which i speak he was just the same as then onli fonder of continu solitud and perhap still more lacon in compani chapter xxxiv for some day after that even mr heathcliff shun meet us at meal yet he would not consent formal to exclud hareton and cathi he had an avers to yield so complet to his feel choos rather to absent himself and eat onc in twenti four hour seem suffici susten for him one night after the famili were in bed i heard him go downstair and out at the front door i did not hear him re enter and in the morn i found he was still away we were in april then the weather was sweet and warm the grass as green as shower and sun could make it and the two dwarf appl tree near the southern wall in full bloom after breakfast catherin insist on my bring a chair and sit with my work under the fir tree at the end of the hous and she beguil hareton who had perfect recov from his accid to dig and arrang her littl garden which was shift to that corner by the influenc of joseph complaint i was comfort revel in the spring fragranc around and the beauti soft blue overhead when my young ladi who had run down near the gate to procur some primros root for a border return onli half laden and inform us that mr heathcliff was come in and he spoke to me she ad with a perplex counten what did he say ask hareton he told me to begon as fast as i could she answer but he look so differ from his

manner in realiti as surpris as she was and anxious to ascertain the truth of her statement for to see the master look glad would not be an everi day spectacl i frame an excus to go in heathcliff stood at the open door he was pale and he trembl yet certain he had a strang joy glitter in his eye that alter the aspect of his whole face will you have some breakfast i said you must be hungri rambl about all night i want to discov where he had been but i did not like to ask direct no im not hungri he answer avert his head and speak rather contemptu as if he guess i was tri to divin the occas of

ani rate this moist season i daresay youll catch a bad cold or a fever you have someth the matter with you now noth but what i can bear he repli and with the greatest pleasur provid youll leav me alon get in and dont annoy me i obey and in pass i notic he breath as fast as a cat yes i reflect to myself we shall have a fit of ill i cannot conceiv what he has been do that noon he sat down to dinner with us and receiv a heap up plate from my hand as if he intend to make amend for previous fast ive neither cold nor fever nelli he remark in allus to my morn speech and im readi to do justic to the food you give me he took his knife and fork and was go to commenc eat when the inclin appear to becom sudden extinct he laid them on the tabl look eager toward the window then rose and went out we saw

return nay he answer but hes not angri he seem rare pleas inde onli i made him impati by speak to him twice and then he bid me be off to you he wonder how i could want the compani of anybodi els i set his plate to keep warm on the fender and after an hour or two he re enter when the room was clear in no degre calmer the same unnaturalit was unnaturalappear of joy under his black brow the same bloodless hue and his teeth visibl now and then in a kind of smile his frame shiver not as one shiver with chill or weak but as a tight stretch cord vibratesa strong thrill rather than trembl i will ask what is the matter i thought or who should and i exclaimedhav you heard ani good news mr heathcliff you look uncommon anim where should good news come from to me he said im anim with hunger and seem i must not eat your dinner is here i return whi wont you get it i dont want it now he mutter hastili ill wait till supper and nelli onc for all let me beg you to warn hareton and the other away

of my heaven i have my eye on it hard three feet to sever me and now youd better go youll neither see nor hear anyth to frighten you if you refrain from pri have swept the hearth and wipe the tabl i depart more perplex than ever he did not quit the hous again that afternoon and no one intrud on his solitud till at eight oclock i deem it proper though unsummon to carri a candl and his supper to him he was lean against the ledg of an open lattic but not look out his face was turn to the interior gloom the fire had smoulder to ash the room was fill with the damp mild air of the cloudi even and so still that not onli the murmur of the beck down gimmerton was distinguish but it rippl and it gurgl over the pebbl or through the larg stone which it could not cover i utter an ejacul of discont at see the dismal grate and commenc shut the casement one after anoth till i came to his must i close this i ask in order to rous him for he would not stir the light flash on his featur as i spoke oh mr lockwood i cannot express what a terribl start i got by the momentari view those deep black eye that smile and ghast pale it appear to me not mr heathcliff but a goblin and in my terror i let the candl bend toward the wall and it left me in dark yes close it he repli in his familiar voic there that is pure awkward whi did you hold the candl horizont be quick and bring anoth i hurri out in a foolish state of dread and said to josephth master wish you to take him a light and rekindl the fire for i dare not go in myself again just then joseph rattl some fire into the shovel and went but he brought it back immedi with the supper tray in his other hand explain that mr heathcliff was go to bed and he want noth to eat till morn we heard him mount the stair direct he did not proceed to his ordinari chamber but turn into that with the panel bed it window as i mention befor is wide enough for anybodi to get through and it struck me that he plot anoth midnight excurs of which he had rather we had no suspicion is he a ghoul or a vampir i muse i had read of such hideous incarn demon and then i set myself to reflect how i had tend him in infanc and watch him grow to youth and follow him almost through his whole cours and what absurd nonsens it was to yield to that sens of horror but where did he come from the littl dark thing harbour by a good man to his bane mutter superstit as i doze into unconsci and i began half dream to weari myself with imagin some fit parentag for him and repeat my wake medit i track his exist over again with grim variat at last pictur his death and funer of which all i can rememb is be exceed vex at have the task of dictat an inscript for his monument and consult the sexton about it and as he had no surnam and we could not tell his age we were oblig to content ourselv with the singl word heathcliff that came true we were if you enter the kirkyard youll read on his headston onli that and the date of his death dawn restor me to common sens i rose and went into the garden as soon as i could see to ascertain if there were ani footmark under his window there were none he has stay at home i thought and hell be all right to day i prepar breakfast for the household as was my usual custom but told hareton and catherin to get their ere the master came down for he lay late they prefer take it out of door under the tree and i set a littl tabl to accommod them on my re entranc i found mr heathcliff below he and joseph were convers about some farm busi he gave clear minut direct concern the matter discuss but he spoke rapid and turn his head continu asid and had the same excit express even more exagger when joseph quit the room he took his seat in the place he general chose and i put a basin of coffe befor him he drew it nearer and then rest his arm on the tabl and look at the opposit wall as i suppos survey one particular portion up and down with glitter restless eye and with such eager interest that he stop breath dure half a minut togeth come now i exclaim push some bread against his hand eat and drink that while it is hot it has been wait near an hour he didnt notic me and yet he smile id rather have seen him gnash his teeth than smile so mr heathcliff master i cri dont for god sake stare as if you saw an unearth vision dont for god sake shout so loud he repli turn round and tell me are we by ourselv of cours was my answer of cours we are still i involuntarili obey him as if i was not quit sure with a sweep of his hand he clear a vacant space in front among the breakfast thing and leant forward to gaze more at his eas now i perceiv he was not look at the wall for when i regard him alon it seem exact that he gaze at someth within two yard distanc and whatev it was it communic appar both pleasur and pain in exquisit extrem at least the anguish yet raptur express of his counten suggest that idea the fanci object was not fix either his eye pursu it with unweari dilig and even in speak to me were never wean away i vain remind him of his protract abstin from food if he stir to touch anyth in complianc with my entreati if he stretch his hand out to get a piec of bread his finger clench befor they reach it and remain on the tabl forget of their aim i sat a model of patienc tri to attract his absorb attent from it engross specul till he grew irrit and got up ask whi i would not allow him to have his own time in take his meal and say that on the next occas i neednt wait i might set the thing down and go have utter these word he left the hous slowli saunter down the garden path and disappear through the gate the hour crept anxious by anoth even came i did not retir to rest till late and when i did i could not sleep he return after midnight and instead of go to bed shut himself into the room beneath i listen and toss about and final dress and descend it was too irksom to lie there harass my brain with a hundr idl misgiv i distinguish mr heathcliff step restless measur the floor and he frequent broke the silenc by a deep inspir resembl a groan he mutter detach word also the onli one i could catch was the name of catherin coupl with some wild term of endear or suffer and spoken as one would speak to a person present low and earnest and wrung from the depth of his soul i had not courag to walk straight into the apart but i desir to divert him from his reveri and therefor fell foul of the kitchen fire stir it and began to scrape the cinder it drew him forth sooner than i expect he open the door immedi and saidnelli come herei it morn come in with your light it is strike four i answer you want a candl to take up stair you might have lit one at this fire no i dont wish to go up stair he said come in and kindl me a fire and do anyth there is to do about the room i must blow the coal red first befor i can carri ani i repli get a chair and the bellow he roam to and fro meantim in a state approach distract his heavi sigh succeed each other so thick as to leav no space for common breath between when day break ill send for green he said i wish to make some legal inquiri of him while i can bestow a thought on those matter and while i can act calm i have not written my will yet and how to leav my properti i cannot determin i wish i could annihil it from the face of the earth i would not talk so mr heathcliff i interpos let your will be a while youll be spare to repent of your mani injustic yet i never expect that your nerv would be disord they are at present marvel so howev and almost entir through your own fault the way youv pass these three last day might knock up a titan do take some food and some repos you need onli look at yourself in a glass to see how you requir both your cheek are hollow and your eye blood shot like a person starv with hunger and go blind with loss of sleep it is not my fault that i cannot eat or rest he repli i assur you it is through no settl design ill do both as soon as i possibl can but you might as well bid a man struggl in the water rest within arm length of the shore i must reach it first and then ill rest well never mind mr green as to repent of my injustic ive done no injustic and i repent of noth im too happi and yet im not happi enough my soul bliss kill my bodi but doe not satisfi itself happi master i cri strang happi if you would hear me without be angri i might offer some advic that would make you happier what is that he ask give it you are awar mr heathcliff i said that from the time you were thirteen year old you have live a selfish unchristian life and probabl hard had a bibl in your hand dure all that period you must have forgotten the content of the book and you may not have space to search it now could it be hurt to send for some onesom minist of ani denomin it doe not matter whichto explain it and show you how veri far you have er from it precept and how unfit you will be for it heaven unless a chang take place befor you die im rather oblig than angri nelli he said for you remind me of the manner in which i desir to be buri it is to be carri to the churchyard in the even you and hareton may if you pleas accompani me and mind particular to notic that the sexton obey my direct concern the two coffin no minist need come nor need anyth be said over mei tell you i have near attain my heaven and that of other is altogeth unvalu and uncovet by me and suppos you persev in your obstin fast and die by that mean and they refus to buri you in the precinct of the kirk i said shock at his godless indiffer how would you like it they wont do that he repli if they did you must have me remov secret and if you neglect it you shall prove practic that the dead are not annihil as soon as he heard the other member of the famili stir he retir to his den and i breath freer but in the afternoon while joseph and hareton were at their work he came into the kitchen again and with a wild look bid me come and sit in the hous he want somebodi with him i declin tell him plain that his strang talk and manner frighten me and i had neither the nerv nor the will to be his companion alon i believ you think me a fiend he said with his dismal laugh someth too horribl to live under a decent roof then turn to catherin who was there and who drew behind me at his approach he ad half sneeringlywil you come chuck ill not hurt you no to you ive made myself wors than the devil well there is one who wont shrink from my compani by god shes relentless oh damn it it unutter too much for flesh and blood to beareven mine he solicit the societi of no one more at dusk he went into his chamber through the whole night and far into the morn we heard him groan and murmur to himself hareton was anxious to enter but i bid him fetch mr kenneth and he should go in and see him when he came and i request admitt and tri to open the door i found it lock and heathcliff bid us be damn he was better and would be left alon so the doctor went away the follow even was veri wet inde it pour down till day dawn and as i took my morn walk round the hous i observ the master window swing open and the rain drive straight in he cannot be in bed i thought those shower would drench him through he must either be up or out but ill make no more ado ill go bold and look have succeed in obtain entranc with anoth key i ran to unclos the panel for the chamber was vacant quick push them asid i peep in mr heathcliff was therelaid on his back his eye met mine so keen and fierc i start and then he seem to smile i could not think him dead but his face and throat were wash with rain the bed cloth drip and he was perfect still the lattic flap to and fro had graze one hand that rest on the sill no blood trickl from the broken skin and when i put my finger to it i could doubt no more he was dead and stark i hasp the window i comb his black long hair from his forehead i tri to close his eye to extinguish if possibl that fright life like gaze of exult befor ani one els beheld it they would not shut they seem to sneer at my attempt and his part lip and sharp white teeth sneer too taken with anoth fit of cowardic i cri out for joseph joseph shuffl up and made a nois but resolut refus to meddl with him th divil harri off his soul he cri and he may hev his carcass into t bargin for aught i care ech what a wick un he look girn at death and the old sinner grin in mockeri i thought he intend to cut a caper round the bed but sudden compos himself he fell on his knee and rais his hand and return thank that the law master and the ancient stock were restor to their right i felt stun by the aw event and my memori unavoid recur to former time with a sort of oppress sad but poor hareton the most wrong was the onli one who realli suffer much he sat by the corps all night weep in bitter earnest he press it hand and kiss the sarcast savag face that everi one els shrank from contempl and bemoan him with that strong grief which spring natur from a generous heart though it be tough as temper steel mr kenneth was perplex to pronounc of what disord the master die i conceal the fact of his have swallow noth for four day fear it might lead to troubl and then i am persuad he did not abstain on purpos it was the consequ of his strang ill not the caus we buri him to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood as he wish earnshaw and i the sexton and six men to carri the coffin comprehend the whole attend the six men depart when they had let it down into the grave we stay to see it cover hareton with a stream face dug green sod and laid them over the brown mould himself at present it is as smooth and verdant as it companion moundsand i hope it tenant sleep as sound but the countri folk if you ask them would swear on the bibl that he walk there are those who speak to have met him near the church and on the moor and even within this hous idl tale youll say and so say i yet that old man by the kitchen fire affirm he has seen two on em look out of his chamber window on everi raini night sinc his deathand an odd thing happen to me about a month ago i was go to the grang one eveninga dark even threaten thunderand just at the turn of the height i encount a littl boy with a sheep and two lamb befor him he was cri terribl and i suppos the lamb were skittish and would not be guid what is the matter my littl man i ask there heathcliff and a woman yonder under t nab he blubber un i darnut pass em i saw noth but neither the sheep nor he would go on so i bid him take the road lower down he probabl rais the phantom from think as he travers the moor alon on the nonsens he had heard his parent and companion repeat yet still i dont like be out in the dark now and i dont like be left by myself in this grim hous i cannot help it i shall be glad when they leav it and shift to the grang they are go to the grang then i said yes answer mrs dean as soon as they are marri and that will be on new year day and who will live here then whi joseph will take care of the hous and perhap a lad to keep him compani they will live in the kitchen and the rest will be shut up for the use of such ghost as choos to inhabit it i observ no mr lockwood said nelli shake her head i believ the dead are at peac but it is not right to speak of them with leviti at that moment the garden gate swung to the rambler were return they are afraid of noth i grumbl watch their approach through the window togeth they would brave satan and all his legion as they step on to the door stone and halt to take a last look at the moonor more correct at each other by her lighti felt irresist impel to escap them again and press a remembr into the hand of mrs dean and disregard her expostul at my rude i vanish through the kitchen as they open the hous door and so should have confirm joseph in his opinion of his fellow servant gay indiscret had he not fortun recognis me for a respect charact by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his feet my walk home was lengthen by a divers in the direct of the kirk when beneath it wall i perceiv decay had made progress even in seven month mani a window show black gap depriv of glass and slate jut off here and there beyond the right line of the roof to be
