of the hindoo work and of the english book abov mention the reader will understand the subject at all event from a materialist realist and practic point of view if all scienc is found more or less on a stratum of fact there can be no harm in make known to mankind general certain matter intim connect with their privat domest and social life ala complet ignor of them has unfortun wreck mani a man and mani a woman while a littl knowledg of a subject general ignor by the mass would have enabl number of peopl to have understood mani thing which they believ to be quit incomprehens or which were not thought worthi of their consider introduct it may be interest to some person to learn how it came about that vatsyayana was first brought to light and translat into the english languag it happen thus while translat with the pundit the anunga runga or the stage of love refer was frequent found to be made to one vatsya the sage vatsya was of this opinion or of that opinion the sage vatsya said this and so on natur question were ask who the sage was and the pundit repli that vatsya was the author of the standard work on love in sanscrit literatur that no sanscrit librari was complet without his work and that it was most difficult now to obtain in it entir state the copi of the manuscript obtain in bombay was defect and so the pundit wrote to benar calcutta and jeypoor for copi of the manuscript from sanscrit librari in those place copi have been obtain they were then compar with each other and with the aid of a commentari call jayamangla a revis copi of the entir manuscript was prepar and from this copi the english translat was made the follow is the certif of the chief pundit the accompani manuscript is correct by me after compar four differ copi of the work i had the assist of a commentari call jayamangla for correct the portion in the first five part but found great difficulti in correct the remain portion becaus with the except of one copi thereof which was toler correct all the other copi i had were far too incorrect howev i took that portion as correct in which the major of the copi agre with each other the aphor on love by vatsyayana contain about one thousand two hundr and fifti sloka or vers and are divid into part part into chapter and chapter into paragraph the whole consist of seven part thirti six chapter and sixti four paragraph hard anyth is known about the author his real name is suppos to be mallinaga or mrillana vatsyayana be his famili name at the close of the work this is what he write about himself after read and consid the work of babhravya and other ancient author and think over the mean of the rule given by them this treatis was compos accord to the precept of the holi writ for the benefit of the world by vatsyayana while lead the life of a religi student at benar and wholli engag in the contempl of the deiti this work is not to be use mere as an instrument for satisfi our desir a person acquaint with the true principl of this scienc who preserv his dharma virtu or religi merit his artha world wealth and his kama pleasur or sensual gratif and who has regard to the custom of the peopl is sure to obtain the masteri over his sens in short an intellig and know person attend to dharma and artha and also to kama without becom the slave of his passion will obtain success in everyth that he may do it is imposs to fix the exact date either of the life of vatsyayana or of his work it is suppos that he must have live between the first and the sixth centuri of the christian era on the follow groundsh mention that satkarni srtvahan a king of kuntal kill malayevati his wife with an instrument call kartari by strike her in the passion of love and vatsya quot this case to warn peopl of the danger aris from some old custom of strike women when under the influenc of this passion now this king of kuntal is believ to have live and reign dure the first centuri ac and consequ vatsya must have live after him on the other hand virahamihira in the eighteenth chapter of his brihatsanhita treat of the scienc of love and appear to have borrow larg from vatsyayana on the subject now virahamihira is said to have live dure the sixth centuri ad and as vatsya must have written his work previous therefor not earlier than the first centuri ac and not later than the sixth centuri ad must be consid as the approxim date of his exist on the text of the aphor on love by vatsyayana onli two commentari have been found one call jayamangla or sutrabashya and the other sutra vritti the date of the jayamangla is fix between the tenth and thirteenth centuri ad becaus while treat of the sixti four art an exampl is taken from the kavyaprakasha which was written about the tenth centuri ad again the copi of the commentari procur was evid a transcript of a manuscript which onc had a place in the librari of a chaulukyan king name vishaladeva a fact elicit from the follow sentenc at the end of it here end the part relat to the art of love in the commentari on the vatsyayana kama sutra a copi from the librari of the king of king vishaladeva who was a power hero as it were a second arjuna and head jewel of the chaulukya famili now it is well known that this king rule in guzerat from 1244 to 1262 ad and found a citi call visalnagur the date therefor of the commentari is taken to be not earlier than the tenth and not later than the thirteenth centuri the author of it is suppos to be one yashodhara the name given him by his preceptor be indrapada he seem to have written it dure the time of afflict caus by his separ from a clever and shrewd woman at least that is what he himself say at the end of each chapter it is presum that he call his work after the name of his absent mistress or the word may have some connect with the mean of her name this commentari was most use in explain the true mean of vatsyayana for the comment appear to have had a consider knowledg of the time of the older author and give in some place veri minut inform this cannot be said of the other commentari call sutra vritti which was written about ad by nars shastri a pupil of a sarveshwar shastri the latter was a descend of bhaskur and so also was our author for at the conclus of everi part he call himself bhaskur nars shastra he was induc to write the work by order of the learn raja vrijalala while he was resid in benar but as to the merit of this commentari it doe not deserv much commend in mani case the writer doe not appear to have understood the mean of the origin author and has chang the text in mani place to fit in with his own explan a complet translat of the origin work now follow it has been prepar in complet accord with the text of the manuscript and is given without further comment as made from it part i the vatsyayana sutra introductori prefac salut to dharma artha and kama in the begin the lord of be creat men and women and in the form of command in one hundr thousand chapter laid down rule

learn in his childhood in his youth and middl age he should attend to artha and kama and in his old age he should perform dharma and thus seek to gain moksha ie releas from further transmigr or on account of the uncertainti of life he may practis them at time when they are enjoin to be practis but one thing is to be note he should lead the life of a religi student until he finish his educ dharma is obedi to the command of the shastra or holi writ of the hindoo to do certain thing such as the perform of sacrific which are not general done becaus they do not belong to this world and produc no visibl effect and not to do other thing such as eat meat which is often done becaus it belong to this world and has visibl effect dharma should be learnt from the shruti holi writ and from those convers with it artha is the acquisit of art land gold cattl wealth equipag and friend it is further the protect of what is acquir and the increas of what is protect artha should be learnt from the king offic and from merchant who may be vers in the way of commerc kama is the enjoy of appropri object by the five sens of hear feel see tast and smell assist by the mind togeth with the soul the ingredi in this is a peculiar contact between the organ of sens and it object and the conscious of pleasur which aris from that contact is call kama kama is to be learnt from the kama sutra aphor on love and from the practic of citizen when all the three viz dharma artha and kama come togeth the former is better than the one which follow it ie dharma is better than artha and artha is better than kama but artha should be alway first practis by the king for the livelihood of men is to be obtain from it onli again kama be the occup of public women they should prefer it to the other two and these are except to the general rule object 1 some learn men say that as dharma is connect with thing not belong to this world it is appropri treat of in a book and so also is artha becaus it is practis onli by the applic of proper mean and a knowledg of those mean can onli be obtain by studi and from book but kama be a thing which is practis even by the brute creation and which is to be found everywher doe not want ani work on the subject answer this is not so sexual intercours be a thing depend on man and woman requir the applic of proper mean by them and those mean are to be learnt from the kama shastra the non applic of proper mean which we see in the brute creation is caus by their be unrestrain and by the femal among them onli be fit for sexual intercours at certain season and no more and by their intercours not be preced by thought of ani kind object 2 the lokayatikas4 sayreligi ordin should not be observ for they bear a futur fruit and at the same time it is also doubt whether they will bear ani fruit at all what foolish person will give away that which is in his own hand into the hand of anoth moreov it is better to have a pigeon to day than a peacock to morrow and a copper coin which we have the certainti of obtain is better than a gold coin the possess of which is doubt answer it is not so 1st holi writ which ordain the practic of dharma doe not admit of a doubt 2nd sacrific such as those made for the destruct of enemi or for the fall of rain are seen to bear fruit 3rd the sun moon star planet and other heaven bodi appear to work intent for the good of the world 4th the exist of this world is effect by the observ of the rule respect the four classes5 of men and their four stage of life 5th we see that seed is thrown into the ground with the hope of futur crop vatsyayana is therefor of opinion that the ordin of religion must be obey object 3 those who believ that destini is the prime mover of all thing sayw should not exert ourselv to acquir wealth for sometim it is not acquir although we strive to get it while at other time it come to us of itself without ani exert on our part everyth is therefor in the power of destini who is the lord of gain and loss of success and defeat of pleasur and pain thus we see the bali6 was rais to the throne of indra by destini and was also put down by the same power and it is destini onli that can re instat him answer it is not right to say so as the acquisit of everi object pre suppos at all event some exert on the part of man the applic of proper mean may be said to be the caus of gain all our end and this applic of proper mean be thus necessari even where a thing is destin to happen it follow that a person who doe noth will enjoy no happi object 4 those who are inclin to think that artha is the chief object to be obtain argu thus pleasur should not be sought for becaus they are obstacl to the practic of dharma and artha which are both superior to them and are also dislik by meritori person pleasur also bring a man into distress and into contact with low person they caus him to commit unright deed and produc impur in him they make him regardless of the futur and encourag careless and leviti and last they caus him to be disbeliev by all receiv by none and despis by everybodi includ himself it is notori moreov that mani men who have given themselv up to pleasur alon have been ruin along with their famili and relat thus king dandakya7 of the bhoja dynasti carri off a brahman daughter with evil intent and was eventu ruin and lost his kingdom indra too have violat the chastiti of ahalya8 was made to suffer for it in a like manner the mighti kichaka9 who tri to seduc draupadi and ravana10 who attempt to gain over sita were punish for their crime these and mani other fell by reason of their pleasur answer this object cannot be sustain for pleasur be as necessari for the exist and well be of the bodi as food are consequ equal requir they are moreov the result of dharma and artha pleasur are therefor to be follow with moder and caution no one refrain from cook food becaus there are beggar to ask for it or from sow seed becaus there are deer to destroy the corn when it is grown up thus a man practis dharma artha and kama enjoy happi both in this world and in the world to come the good perform those action in which there is no fear as to what is to result from them in the next world and in which there is no danger to their welfar ani action which conduc to the practic of dharma artha and kama togeth or of ani two or even one of them should be perform but an action which conduc to the practic of one of them at the expens of the remain two should not be perform footnot footnot 4 these were certain materialist who seem to think that a bird in the hand was worth two in the bush footnot 5 among the hindoo the four class of men are the brahman or priest class the kshutrya or warlik class the vaishya or agricultur and mercantil class and the shoodra or menial class the four stage of life are the life of a religi student the life of a household the life of a hermit and the life of a sunyasi or devote footnot 6 bali was a demon who had conquer indra and gain his throne but was afterward overcom by vishnu at the time of his fifth incarn footnot 7 dandakya is said to have abduct from the forest the daughter of a brahman name bhargava and be curs by the brahman was buri with his kingdom under a shower of dust the place was call after his name the dandaka forest celebr in the ramayana but now unknown footnot 8 ahalya was the wife of the sage gautama indra caus her to believ that he was gautama and thus enjoy her he was curs by gautama and subsequ afflict with a thousand ulcer on his bodi footnot 9 kichaka was the brother in law of king virata with whom the pandava had taken refug for one year kichaka was kill by bhima who assum the disguis of draupadi for this stori the mahabarata should be refer to footnot 10 the stori of ravana is told in the ramayana which with the mahabarata form the two great epic poem of the hindoo the latter was written by vyasa and the former by valmiki chapter iii on the art and scienc to be studi man should studi the kama sutra and the art and scienc subordin thereto in addit to the studi of the art and scienc contain in dharma and artha even young maid should studi this kama sutra along with it art and scienc befor marriag and after it they should continu to do so with the consent of their husband here some learn men object and say that femal not be allow to studi ani scienc should not studi the kama sutra but vatsyayana is of opinion that this object doe not hold good for women alreadi know the practic of kama sutra and that practic is deriv from the kama shastra or the scienc of kama itself moreov it is not onli in this but in mani other case that though the practic of a scienc is known to all onli a few person are acquaint with the rule and law on which the scienc is base thus the yadnika or sacrific though ignor of grammar make use of appropri word when address the differ deiti and do not know how these word are frame again person do the duti requir of them on auspici day which are fix by astrolog though they are not acquaint with the scienc of astrolog in a like manner rider of hors and eleph train these anim without know the scienc of train anim but from practic onli and similar the peopl of the most distant provinc obey the law of the kingdom from practic and becaus there is a king over them and without further reason11 and from experi we find that some women such as daughter of princ and their minist and public women are actual vers in the kama shastra a femal therefor should learn the kama shastra or at least a part of it by studi it practic from some confidenti friend she should studi alon in privat the sixti four practic that form a part of the kama shastra her teacher should be one of the follow person viz the daughter of a nurs brought up with her and alreadi married12 or a femal friend who can be trust in everyth or the sister of her mother ie her aunt or an old femal servant or a femal beggar who may have former live in the famili or

of the theatr of the hindoo in two volum trubner and co 1871 it may be fair consid that the courtesan was one of the element and an import element too of earli hindoo societi and that her educ and intellect were both superior to that of the women of the household wilson say by the vesya or courtesan howev we are not to understand a femal who has disregard the oblig of law or the precept of virtu but a charact rear by a state of manner unfriend to the admiss of wed femal into societi and open it onli at the expens of reput to women who were train for associ with men by person and mental

this paragraph might appli to the nihilist and fenian of the day or to secret societi it was perhap a refer to the thug chapter v about the kind of women resort to by the citizen and of friend and messeng when kama is practis by men of the four cast accord to the rule of the holi writ ie by law marriag with virgin of their own cast it then becom a mean of acquir law progeni and good fame and it is not also oppos to the custom of the world on the contrari the practic of kama with women of the higher cast and with those previous enjoy by other even though they be of the same cast is prohibit but the practic of kama with women of the lower cast with women excommun from their own cast with public women and with women twice married31 is neither enjoin nor prohibit the object of practis kama with such women is pleasur onli nayikas32 therefor are of three kind viz maid women twice marri and public women gonikaputra has express an opinion that there is a fourth kind of nayika viz a woman who is resort to on some special occas even though she be previous marri to anoth these special occas are when a man think thus a this woman is self will and has been previous enjoy by mani other besid myself i may therefor safe resort to her as to a public woman though she belong to a higher cast than mine and in so do i shall not be violat the ordin of dharma or thus b this is a twice marri woman and has been enjoy by other befor me there is therefor no object to my resort to her or thus c this woman has gain the heart of her great and power husband and exercis a masteri over him who is a friend of my enemi if therefor she becom unit with me she will caus her husband to abandon my enemi or thus d this woman will turn the mind of her husband who is veri power in my favour he be at present disaffect toward me and intent on do me some harm or thus e by make this woman my friend i shall gain the object of some friend of mine or shall be abl to effect the ruin of some enemi or shall accomplish some other difficult purpos or thus f by be unit with this woman i shall kill her husband and so obtain his vast rich which i covet or thus g the union of this woman with me is not attend with ani danger and will bring me wealth of which on account of my poverti and inabl to support myself i am veri much in need i shall therefor obtain her vast rich in this way without ani difficulti or thus h this woman love me ardent and know all my weak point if therefor i am unwil to be unit with her she will make my fault public and thus tarnish my charact and reput or she will bring some gross accus against me of which it may be hard to clear myself and i shall be ruin or perhap she will detach from me her husband who is power and yet under her control and will unit him to my enemi or will herself join the latter or thus i the husband of this woman has violat the chastiti of my wive i shall therefor return that injuri by seduc his wive or thus j by the help of this woman i shall kill an enemi of the king who has taken shelter with her and whom i am order by the king to destroy or thus k the woman whom i love is under the control of this woman i shall through the influenc of the latter be abl to get at the former or thus l this woman will bring to me a maid who possess wealth and beauti but who is hard to get at and under the control of anoth or last thus m my enemi is a friend of this woman husband i shall therefor caus her to join him and will thus creat an enmiti between her husband and him for these and similar other reason the wive of other men may be resort to but it must be distinct understood that is onli allow for special reason and not for mere carnal desir charayana think that under these circumst there is also a fifth kind of nayika viz a woman who is kept by a minist and who repair to him occasion or a widow who accomplish the purpos of a man with the person to whom she resort suvarnanabha add that a woman who pass the life of an ascet and in the condit of a widow may be consid as a sixth kind of nayika ghotakamukha say that the daughter of a public woman and a femal servant who are still virgin form a seventh kind of nayika gonardiya put forth his doctrin that ani woman born of good famili after she has come of age is an eighth kind of nayika but these four latter kind of nayika do not differ much from the first four kind of them as there is no separ object in resort to them therefor vatsyayana is of opinion that there are onli four kind of nayika ie the maid the twice marri woman the public woman and the woman resort to for a special purpos the follow women are not to be enjoy a leper a lunat a woman turn out of cast a woman who reveal secret a woman who public express desir for sexual intercours a woman who is extrem white a woman who is extrem black a bad smell woman a woman who is a near relat a woman who is a femal friend a woman who lead the life of an ascet and last the wife of a relat of a friend of a learn brahman and of the king the follow of babhravya say that ani woman who has been enjoy by five men is a fit and proper person to be enjoy but gonikaputra is of opinion that even when this is the case the wive of a relat of a learn brahman and of a king should be except the follow are the kind of friend one who has play with you in the dust ie in childhood one who is bound by an oblig one who is of the same disposit and fond of the same thing one who is a fellow student one who is acquaint with your secret and fault and whose fault and secret are also known to you one who is a child of your nurs one who is brought up with you one who is an hereditari friend these friend should possess the follow qualiti they should tell the truth they should not be chang by time they should be favour to your design they should be firm they should be free from covet they should not be capabl of be gain over by other they should not reveal your secret charayana say that citizen form friendship with washermen barber cowherd florist druggist betel leaf seller tavern keeper beggar pithamarda vita and vidusheka as also with the wive of all these peopl a messeng should possess the follow qualiti skil bold knowledg of the intent of men by their outward sign absenc of confus ie no shyness knowledg of the exact mean of what other do or say good manner knowledg of appropri time and place for do differ thing ingenu in busi quick comprehens quick applic of remedi ie quick and readi resourc and this part end with a vers the man who is ingeni and wise who is accompani by a friend and who know the intent of other as also the proper time and place for do everyth can gain over veri easili even a woman who is veri hard to be obtain footnot footnot 31 this term doe not appli to a widow but to a woman who had probabl left her husband and is live with some other person as a marri woman marital as they say in franc footnot 32 ani woman fit to be enjoy without sin the object of the enjoy of women is twofold viz pleasur and progeni ani woman who can be enjoy without sin for the purpos of accomplish either the one or the other of these two object is a nayika the fourth kind of nayika which vatsya admit further on is neither enjoy for pleasur or for progeni but mere for accomplish some special purpos in hand the word nayika is retain as a technic term throughout =end of part i= part ii of sexual union chapter i kind of sexual union accord to a dimens b forc of desir or passion c time kind of union man is divid into three class viz the hare man the bull man and the hors man accord to the size of his lingam woman also accord to the depth of her yoni is either a femal deer a mare or a femal eleph there are thus three equal union between person of correspond dimens and there are six unequ union when the dimens do not correspond or nine in all as the follow tabl show +++ equal unequ +++ men women men women ++ + + hare deer hare mare bull mare hare eleph hors eleph bull deer bull eleph hors deer hors mare ++ ++ + in these unequ union when the male exceed the femal in point of size his union with a woman who is immedi next to him in size is call high union and is of two kind while his union with the woman most remot from him in size is call the highest union and is of one kind onli on the other hand when the femal exceed the male in point of size her union with a man immedi next to her in size is call low union and is of two kind while her union with a man most remot from her in size is call the lowest union and is of one kind onli in other word the hors and mare the bull and deer form the high union while the hors and deer form the highest union on the femal side the eleph and bull the mare and hare form low union while the eleph and the hare make the lowest union there are then nine kind of union accord to dimens amongst all these equal union are the best those of a superl degre ie the highest and the lowest are the worst and the rest are middl and with them the high33 are better than the low there are also nine kind of union accord to the forc of passion or carnal desir as follow + + + + + men women men women + + + + small small small middl middl middl small intens intens intens middl small middl intens intens small intens middl + + + + + a man is call a man of small passion whose desir at the time of sexual union is not great whose semen is scanti and who cannot bear the warm embrac of the femal those who differ from this tempera are call men of middl passion while those of intens passion are full of desir in the same way women are suppos to have the three degre of feel as specifi abov last accord to time there are three kind of men and women viz the short time the moder time and the long time and of these as in the previous statement there are nine kind of union but on this last head there is a differ of opinion about the femal which should be state auddalika say femal do not emit as male do the male simpli remov their desir while the femal from their conscious of desir feel a certain kind of pleasur which give them satisfact but it is imposs for them to tell you what kind of pleasur they feel the fact from which this becom evid is that male when engag in coition ceas of themselv after emiss and are satisfi but it is not so with femal this opinion is howev object to on the ground that if a male be a long time the femal love him the more but if he be short time she is dissatisfi with him and this circumst some say would prove that the femal emit also but this opinion doe not hold good for if it take a long time to allay a woman desir and dure this time she is enjoy great pleasur it is quit natur then that she should wish for it continu and on this subject there is a vers as follow by union with men the lust desir or passion of women is satisfi and the pleasur deriv from the conscious of it is call their satisfact the follow of babhravya howev say that the semen of women continu to fall from the begin of the sexual union to it end and it is right that it should be so for if they had no semen there would be no embryo to this there is an object in the begin of coition the passion of the woman is middl and she cannot bear the vigor thrust of her lover but by degre her passion increas until she ceas to think about her bodi and then final she wish to stop from further coition this object howev doe not hold good for even in ordinari thing that revolv with great forc such as a potter wheel or a top we find that the motion at first is slow but by degre it becom veri rapid in the same way the passion of the woman have gradual increas she has a desir to discontinu coition when all the semen has fallen away and there is a vers with regard to this as follow the fall of the semen of the man take place onli at the end of coition while the semen of the woman fall continu and after the semen of both has all fallen away then they wish for the discontinu of coition34 last vatsyayana is of opinion that the semen of the femal fall in the same way as that of the male now some may ask here if men and women are be of the same kind and are engag in bring about the same result whi should they have differ work to do vatsya say that this is so becaus the way of work as well as the conscious of pleasur in men and women are differ the differ in the way of work by which men are the actor and women are the person act upon is owe to the natur of the male and the femal otherwis the actor would be sometim the person act upon and vice versa and from this differ in the way of work follow the differ in the conscious of pleasur for a man think this woman is unit with me and a woman think i am unit with this man it may be said that if the way of work in men and women are differ whi should not there be a differ even in the pleasur they feel and which is the result of those way but this object is groundless for the person act and the person act upon be of differ kind there is a reason for the differ in their way of work but there is no reason for ani differ in the pleasur they feel becaus they both natur deriv pleasur from the act they perform35 on this again some may say that when differ person are engag in do the same work we find that they accomplish the same end or purpos while on the contrari in the case of men and women we find that each of them accomplish his or her own end separ and this is inconsist but this is a mistak for we find that sometim two thing are done at the same time as for instanc in the fight of ram both the ram receiv the shock at the same time on their head again in throw one wood appl against anoth and also in a fight or struggl of wrestler if it be said that in these case the thing employ are of the same kind it is answer that even in the case of men and women the natur of the two person is the same and as the differ in their way of work aris from the differ of their conform onli it follow that men experi the same kind of pleasur as women do there is also a vers on this subject as follow men and women be of the same natur feel the same kind of pleasur and therefor a man should marri such a woman as will love him ever afterward the pleasur of men and women be thus prove to be of the same kind it follow that in regard to time there are nine kind of sexual intercours in the same way as there are nine kind accord to the forc of passion there be thus nine kind of union with regard to dimens forc of passion and time respect by make combin of them innumer kind of union would be produc therefor in each particular kind of sexual union men should use such mean as they may think suitabl for the occasion36 at the first time of sexual union the passion of the male is intens and his time is short but in subsequ union on the same day the revers of this is the case with the femal howev it is the contrari for at the first time her passion is weak and then her time long but on subsequ occas on the same day her passion is intens and her time short until her passion is satisfi on the differ kind of love men learn in the human are of opinion that love is of four kind viz 1 love acquir by continu habit 2 love result from the imagin 3 love result from belief 4 love result from the percept of extern object 1 love result from the constant and continu perform and habit as for instanc the love of sexual intercours the love of hunt the love of drink the love of gambl etc etc 2 love which is felt for thing to which we are not habitu and which proceed entir from idea is call love result from imagin as for instanc that love which some men and women and eunuch feel for the auparishtaka or mouth congress and that which is felt by all for such thing as embrac kiss etc etc 3 the love which is mutual on both side and prove to be true when each look upon the other as his or her veri own such is call love result from belief by the learn 4 the love result from the percept of etern object is quit evid and well known to the world becaus the pleasur which it afford is superior to the pleasur of the other kind of love which exist onli for it sake what has been said in this chapter upon the subject of sexual union is suffici for the learn but for the edif of the ignor the same will now be treat of at length and in detail footnot footnot 33 high union are said to be better than low one for in the former it is possibl for the male to satisfi his own passion without injur the femal while in the latter it is difficult for the femal to be satisfi by ani mean footnot 34 the strength of passion with women vari a great deal some be easili satisfi and other eager and will to go on for a long time to satisfi these last thorough a man must have recours to art it is certain that a fluid flow from the woman in larger or smaller quantiti but her satisfact is not complet until she has experienc the spasm genesiqu as describ in a french work recent publish and call breviar de lamour experiment par le dr jule guyot footnot 35 this is a long dissert veri common among sanscrit author both when write and talk social they start certain proposit and then argu for and against them what it is presum the author mean is that though both men and women deriv pleasur from the act of coition the way it is produc is brought about by differ mean each individu perform his own work in the matter irrespect of the other and each deriv individu their own conscious of pleasur from the act they perform there is a differ in the work that each doe and a differ in the conscious of pleasur that each has but no differ in the pleasur they feel for each feel that pleasur to a greater or lesser degre footnot 36 this paragraph should be particular note for it special appli to marri men and their wive so mani men utter ignor the feel of the women and never pay the slightest attent to the passion of the latter to understand the subject thorough it is absolut necessari to studi it and then a person will know that as dough is prepar for bake so must a woman be prepar for sexual intercours if she is to deriv satisfact from it chapter ii of the embrac this part of the kama shastra which treat of sexual union is also call sixti four chatushshashti some old author say that it is call so becaus it contain sixti four chapter other are of opinion that the author of this part be a person name panchala and the person who recit the part of the rig veda call dashatapa which contain sixti four vers be also call panchala the name sixti four has been given to the part of the work in honour of the rig veda the follow of babhravya say on the other hand that this part contain eight subject viz the embrac kiss scratch with the nail or finger bite lie down make various sound play the part of a man and the auparishtaka or mouth congress each of these subject be of eight kind and eight multipli by eight be sixti four this part is therefor name sixti four but vatsyayana affirm that as this part contain also the follow subject viz strike cri the act of a man dure congress the various kind of congress and other subject the name sixti four is given to it onli accident as for instanc we say this tree is saptaparna or seven leav this offer of rice is panchavarna or five colour but the tree has not seven leav neither has the rice five colour howev the part sixti four is now treat of and the embrac be the first subject will now be consid now the embrac which indic the mutual love of a man and woman who have come togeth is of four kind viz touch pierc rub press the action in each case is denot by the mean of the word which stand for it 1 when a man under some pretext or other goe in front or alongsid of a woman and touch her bodi with his own it is call the touch embrac 2 when a woman in a

be made with the nail for the ancient author say that as there are innumer degre of skill among men the practic of this art be known to all so there are innumer way of make these mark and as press or mark with the nail is independ of love no one can say with certainti how mani differ kind of mark with the nail do actual exist the reason of this is vatsyayana say that as varieti is necessari in love so love is to be produc by mean of varieti it is on this account that courtezan who are well acquaint with various way and mean becom so desir for if varieti is sought in all the art and amus such as archeri and other how much more should it be sought after in the present case the mark of the nail should not be made on marri women but particular kind of mark may be made on their privat part for the remembr and increas of love there are also some vers on the subject as follow the love of a woman who see the mark of nail on the privat part of her bodi even though they are old and almost worn out becom again fresh and new if there be no mark of nail to remind a person of the passag of love then love is lessen in the same way as when no union take place for a long time even when

influenc the mind of a woman even though it be ever so firm in short noth tend to increas love so much as the effect of mark with the nail and bite footnot footnot 37 from this it would appear that in

should do such thing as are agreeabl to the women of differ countri the women of the central countri ie between the gang and the jumna are nobl in their charact not accustom to disgrac practic and dislik press the nail and bite the women of the balhika countri are gain over by strike the women of avantika are fond of foul pleasur and have not good manner the women of the maharashtra are fond of

as the women of the maharashtra but show their like onli in secret the women of the dravida countri though they are rub and press about at the time of sexual enjoy have a slow fall of semen that is

they are fond of take medicin to make it do so the women of the audhra countri have tender bodi they are fond of enjoy and have a like for voluptu pleasur the women of ganda have tender bodi and speak sweet now suvarnanabha is of opinion that that which is agreeabl to the natur of a particular person is of more consequ than that which is agreeabl to a whole nation and that therefor the peculiar of the countri should not be observ in such case the various pleasur the dress and the sport of one countri are in time borrow by anoth and in such a case these thing must be consid as belong origin to that countri among the thing mention abov viz embrac kiss etc those which increas passion should be done first and those which are onli for amus or varieti should be done afterward there are also some vers on this subject as follow when a man bite a woman forcibl she should angrili do the same to him with doubl forc thus a point should be return with a line of point and a line of point with a broken cloud and if she be excess chafe she should at onc begin a love quarrel with him at such a time she should take hold of her lover by the hair and bend his head down and kiss his lower lip and then be intox with love she should shut her eye and bite him in various place even by day and in a place of public resort when her lover show her ani mark that she may have inflict on his bodi she should smile at the sight of it and turn her face as if she were go to chide him she should show him with an angri look the mark on her own bodi that have been made by him thus if men and women act accord to each other like their love for each other will not be lessen even in one hundr year chapter vi of the differ way of lie down and various kind of congress on the occas of a high congress the

place are the shoulder the head the space between the breast the back the jaghana or middl part of the bodi the side strike is of four kind viz strike with the back of the hand strike with the finger a littl contract strike with the fist strike with the open palm of the hand on account of it caus pain strike give rise to the hiss sound which is of various kind and to the eight kind of cri viz the sound hin the thunder sound the coo sound the weep sound the sound phut the sound phat the sound sut the sound plat besid these there are also word have a mean such as mother and those that are express of prohibit suffici desir of liber pain or prais and to which may be ad sound like those of the dove the cuckoo the green pigeon the parrot the bee the sparrow the flamingo the duck and the quail which are all occasion made use of blow with the fist should be given on the back of the woman while she is sit on the lap of the man and she should give blow in return abus the man as if she were angri and make the coo and the weep sound while the woman is engag in congress the space between the breast should be struck with the back of the hand slowli at first and then proportion to the

woman should be press with the open palm of the hand with some forc until the end of it and then sound like those of the quail or the goos should be made there are also two vers on the subject as follow the characterist of manhood are said to consist of rough and impetuos while weak tender sensibl and an inclin to turn away from unpleas thing are the distinguish mark of womanhood the excit of passion and peculiar of habit may sometim caus contrari result to appear but these do not last long and in the end the natur state is resum the wedg on the bosom the scissor on the head the pierc instrument on the cheek and the pincher on the breast and side may also be taken into consider with the other four mode of strike and thus give eight way altogeth but these four way of strike with instrument are peculiar to the peopl of the southern countri and the mark caus by them are seen on the breast of their women they are local peculiar but vatsyayana is of opinion that the practic of them is pain barbar and base and quit unworthi of imit in the same way anyth that is a local peculiar should not alway be adopt elsewher and even in the place where the practic is preval excess of it should alway be avoid instanc of the danger use of them may be given as follow the king of the panchala kill the courtezan madhavasena by mean of the wedg dure congress king shatakarni shatavahana of the kuntala depriv his great queen malayavati of her life by a pair of scissor and naradeva whose hand was deform blind a danc girl by direct a pierc instrument in a wrong way there are also two vers on the subject as follow about these thing there cannot be either enumer or ani definit rule congress have onc commenc passion alon give birth to all the act of the parti such passion action and amor gesticul or movement which aris on the spur of the moment and dure sexual intercours cannot be defin and are as irregular as dream a hors have onc attain the fifth degre of motion goe on with blind speed regardless of pit ditch and post in his way and in the same manner a love pair becom blind with passion in the heat of congress and go on with great impetuos pay not the least regard to excess for this reason one who is well acquaint with the scienc of love and know his own strength as also the tender impetuos and strength of the young woman should act accord the various mode of enjoy are not for all time or for all person but they should onli be use at the proper time and in the proper countri and place footnot footnot 38 men who are well acquaint with the art of love are well awar how often one woman differ from anoth in her sigh and sound dure the time of congress some women like to be talk to in the most love way other in the most abus way and so on some women enjoy themselv with close eye in silenc other make a great nois over it and some almost faint away the great art is to ascertain what give them the greatest pleasur and what special they like best chapter viii about women act the part of a man and of the work of a man when a woman see that her lover is fatigu by constant congress without have his desir satisfi she should with his permiss lay him down upon his back and give him assist by act his part she may also do this to satisfi the curios of her lover or her own desir of novelti there are two way of do this the first is when dure congress she turn round and get on the top of her lover in such a manner as to continu the congress without obstruct the pleasur of it and the other is when she act the man part from the begin at such a time with flower in her hair hang loos and her smile broken by hard breath she should press upon her lover bosom with her own breast and lower her head frequent should do in return the same action which he use to do befor return his blow and chaf him should say i was laid down by you and fatigu with hard congress i shall now therefor lay you down in return she should then again manifest her own bash her fatigu and her desir of stop the congress in this way she should do the work of a man which we shall present relat whatev is done by a man for give pleasur to a woman is call the work of a man and is as follow while the woman is lie on his bed and is as it were abstract by his convers he should loosen the knot of her under garment and when she begin to disput with him he should overwhelm her with kiss then when his lingam is erect he should touch her with his hand in various place and gentl manipul various part of the bodi if the woman is bash and if it is the first time that they have come togeth the man should place his hand between her thigh which she would probabl keep close togeth and if she is a veri young girl he should first get his hand upon her breast which she would probabl cover with her own hand and under her armpit and on her neck if howev she is a season woman he should do whatev is agreeabl either to him or to her and whatev is fit for the occas after this he should take hold of her hair and hold her chin in his finger for the purpos of kiss her on this if she is a young girl she will becom bash and close her eye ani how he should gather from the action of the woman what thing would be pleas to her dure congress here suvarnanabha say that while a man is do to the woman what he like best dure congress he should alway make a point of press those part of her bodi on which she turn her eye the sign of the enjoy and satisfact of the women are as follow her bodi relax she close her eye she put asid all bash and show increas willing to unit the two organ as

never be done by a learn brahman by a minist that carri on the busi of a state or by a man of good reput becaus though the practic is allow by the shastra there is no reason whi it should be carri on and need onli be practis in particular case as for instanc the tast and the strength and the digest qualiti of the flesh of dog are mention in work on medicin but it doe not therefor follow that it

natur want tender begin and when they are forcibl approach by men with whom they are but slight acquaint they sometim sudden becom hater of sexual connect and sometim even hater of the male sex the man should therefor approach the girl accord to her like and should make use of those devic by which he may be abl to establish himself more and more into her confid these devic are as follow he should embrac her first of all in a way she like most becaus it doe not last for a long time he should embrac her with the upper part of his bodi becaus that is easier and simpler if the girl is grown up or if the man has known her for some time he may embrac her by the light of a lamp but if he is not well acquaint with her or if she is a young girl he should then embrac her in dark when the girl

without make ani sound when she is gain over in this respect he should then make her talk and so that she may be induc to talk he should ask her question about thing of which he know or pretend to know noth and which can be answer in a few word if she doe not speak to him he should not frighten her but should ask her the same thing again and again in a conciliatori manner if she doe not then speak he should urg her to give a repli becaus as ghotakamukha say all girl hear everyth said to them by men but do not themselv sometim say a singl word when she is thus importun the girl should give repli by shake of the head but if she quarrel with the man she should not even do that when she is ask by the man whether she wish for him and whether she like him she should remain silent for a long time and when at last importun to repli should give him a favour answer by a nod of the head if the man is previous acquaint with the girl he should convers with her by mean of a femal friend who may be favour to him and in the confid of both and carri on the convers on both side on such an occas the girl should smile with her head bent down and if the femal friend say more on her part than she was desir to do she should chide her and disput with her the femal friend should say in jest even what she is not desir to say by the girl and add she say so on which the girl should say indistinct and prettili o no i did not say so and she should then smile and throw an occasion glanc toward the man if the girl is familiar with the man she should place near him without say anyth the tambula the ointment or the garland that he may have ask for or she may tie them up in his upper garment while she is engag in this the man should touch her young breast in the sound way of press with the nail and if she prevent him do this he should say to her i will not do it again if you will embrac me and should in this way caus her to embrac him while he is be embrac by her he should pass his hand repeat over and about her bodi by and bye he should place her in his lap and tri more and more to gain her consent and if she will not yield to him he should frighten her by say i shall impress mark of my teeth and nail on your lip and breast and then make similar mark on my own bodi and shall tell my friend that you did them what will you say then in this and other way as fear and confid are creat in the mind of children so should the man gain her over to his wish on the second and third night after her confid has increas still more he should feel the whole of her bodi with his hand and kiss her all over he should also place his hand upon her thigh and shampoo them and if he succeed in this he should then shampoo the joint of her thigh if she tri to prevent him do this he should say to her what harm is there in do it and should persuad her to let him do it after gain this point he should touch her privat part should loosen her girdl and the knot of her dress and turn up her lower

to rival women and at last after have overcom her bash he should begin to enjoy her in a way so as not to frighten her so much about creat confid in the girl and there are moreov some vers on the subject as follow a man act accord to the inclin of a girl should tri and gain her over so that she may love him and place her confid in him a man doe not succeed either by implicit follow the inclin of a girl or by wholli oppos her and he should therefor adopt a middl cours he who know how to make himself belov by women as well as to increas their honour and creat confid in them this man becom an

that whenev it is possibl a man should alway act himself in these matter and it is onli when such is impractic or imposs that femal messeng should be employ as for the say that women who act and talk bold and freeli are to be won by the person effort of the man and that women who do not possess those qualiti are to be got at by femal messeng it is onli a matter of talk now when a man act himself in the matter he should first of all make the acquaint of the woman he love in the follow manner 1st he should arrang to be seen by the woman either on a natur or special opportun a natur opportun is

manifest her love or desir either by sign or by motion of her bodi and is afterward rare or never seen ani where or if a woman is met for the first time the man should get a go between to approach her now the go between have wheedl herself into the confid of the woman by act accord to her disposit should tri to make her hate or despis her husband by hold art convers with her by tell her about medicin for get children by talk to her about other peopl by tale of various kind by stori about the wive of other men and by prais her beauti wisdom generos and good natur and then say to her it is inde a piti that you who are so excel a woman in everi way should be possess of a husband of this kind beauti ladi he is not fit even to serv you the go between should further talk to the woman about the weak of the passion of her husband his jealousi his rogueri his ingratitud his avers to enjoy his dull his mean and all the other fault that he may have and with which she may be acquaint she should particular harp upon that fault or that fail by which the wife may appear to be the most affect if the wife be a deer woman and the husband a hare man then there would be no fault in that direct but in the event of his be a hare man and she a mare woman or eleph woman then this fault should be point out to her gonikaputra is of opinion that when it is the first affair of the woman or when her love has onli been veri secret shown the man should then secur and send to her a go between with whom she may be alreadi acquaint and in whom she confid but to return to our subject the go between should tell the woman about the obedi and love of the man and as her confid and affect increas she should then explain to her the thing to be accomplish in the follow way hear this oh beauti ladi that this man born of a good famili have seen you has gone mad on your account the poor young man who is tender by natur has never been distress in such a way befor and it is high probabl that he will succumb under his present afflict and experi the pain of death if the woman listen with a favour ear then on the follow day the go between have observ mark of good spirit in her face in her eye and in her manner of convers should again convers with her on the subject of the man and should tell her the stori of ahalya59 and indra of sakoontala60 and dushyanti and such other as may be fit for the occas she should also describ to her the strength of the man his talent his skill in the sixti four sort of enjoy mention by babhravya his good look and his liaison with some praiseworthi woman no matter whether this last ever took place or not in addit to this the go between should care note the behaviour of the woman which if favour would be as follow she would address her with a smile look would seat herself close besid her and ask her where have you been what have you been do where did you dine where did you sleep where have you been sit moreov the woman would meet the go between in lone place and tell her stori there would yawn contempl draw long sigh give her present rememb her on occas of festiv dismiss her with a wish to see her again and say to her jest oh well speak woman whi do you speak these bad word to me would discours on the sin of her union with the man would not tell her about ani previous visit or convers that she may have had with him but wish to be ask about these and last would laugh at the man desir but would not reproach him in ani way thus end the behaviour of the woman with the go between when the woman manifest her love in the manner abov describ the go between should increas it by bring to her love token from the man but if the woman be not acquaint with the man person the go between should win her over by extol and prais his good qualiti and by tell stori about his love for her here auddalaka say that when a man or woman are not person acquaint with each other and have not shown each other ani sign of affect the employ of a go between is useless the follow of babhravya on the other hand affirm that even though they be person unacquaint but have shown each other sign of affect there is an occas for the employ of a go between gonikaputra assert that a go between should be employ provid they are acquaint with each other even though no sign of affect may have pass between them vatsyayana howev lay it down that even though

figur of various kind cut in leav togeth with ear ornament and chaplet made of flower contain love letter express of the desir of the man61 and she should caus her to send affection present to the man in return after they have mutual accept each other present then a meet should be arrang between them on the faith of the go between the follow of babhravya say that this meet should take place at the time of go to the templ of a deiti or on occas of fair garden parti theatric perform marriag sacrific festiv and funer as also at the time of go to the river to bath or at time of natur calamities62 fear of robber or hostil invas of the countri gonikaputra is of opinion howev that these meet had better be brought about in the abod of femal friend mendic astrolog and ascet but vatsyayana decid that that place is onli well suit for the purpos which has proper mean of ingress and egress and where arrang have been made to prevent ani accident occurr and when a man who has onc enter the hous

anoth 1 now if the man has left both women of his own accord he should not be resort to on account of the fickl of his mind and his indiffer to the excel of both of them 2 as regard the man who may have been driven away from both women if he has been driven away from the last one becaus the woman could get more money from some other man then he should be resort to for if attach to the first woman he would give her more money through vaniti and emul to spite the other woman but if he has been driven away by the woman on account of his poverti or stingi he should not then be resort to 3 in

consid all these thing she should resort to him or not accord to circumst 5 as regard the man who may have been driven away from the one woman and left the other of his own accord the former woman wish to re unit with him should first ascertain whether he still has ani affect for her and would consequ spend much money upon her or whether be attach to her excel qualiti he did not take delight in

confid in her mind and then take back from her the wealth which she former took from him and final destroy her or last whether he wish first to separ her from her present lover and then to break away from her himself if after consid all these thing she is of opinion that his intent are realli pure and honest she can re unit herself with him but if his mind be at all taint with evil intent he should be avoid 6 in the case of the man who may have been driven away by one woman and be live with anoth if the man make overtur in return to the first one the courtesan should consid well befor she act and while the other woman is engag in attract him to herself she should tri in her turn through keep herself behind the scene to gain him over on the ground of ani of the follow consider viz 1st that he was driven away unjust and for no proper reason and now that he has gone to anoth woman everi effort must be use to bring him back to myself 2nd that if he were onc to convers with me again he would break away from the other woman 3rd that the pride of my present lover would be put down by mean of the former one 4th that he has becom wealthi has secur a higher posit and hold a place of

courtesan is resolv to take up again with a former lover her pithamurda and other servant should tell him that his former expuls from the woman hous was caus by the wicked of her mother that the woman love him just as much as ever at that time but could not help the occurr on account of her defer to her mother will that she hate the union of her present lover and dislik him excess in addit to this they should creat confid in his mind by speak to him of her former love for him and should allud to the mark of that love that she has ever rememb this mark of her love should be connect with some kind of pleasur that may have been practis by him such as his way of kiss her or manner of have connect with her thus end the way of bring about a re union with a former lover when a woman has to choos between two lover one of whom was former unit with her while the other is a stranger the acharya sage are of opinion that the first one is prefer becaus his disposit and charact be alreadi known by previous care observ he can be easili pleas and satisfi but vatsyayana think that a former lover have alreadi spent a great deal of his wealth is not abl or will to give much money again and is not therefor to be reli upon so much as a stranger particular case may howev aris differ from this general rule on account of the differ natur of men there are also vers on the subject as follow re union with a former lover may be desir so as to separ some particular woman from some particular man or some particular man from some particular woman or to have a certain effect upon the present lover when a man is excess attach to a woman he is afraid of her come into contact with other men he doe not then regard or notic her fault and he give her much wealth through fear of her leav him a courtesan should be agreeabl to the man who is attach to her and despis the man who doe not care for her if while she is live with one man a messeng come to her from some other man she may either refus to listen to ani negoti on his part or appoint a fix time for him to visit her but she should not leav the man who may be live with her and who may be attach to her a wise woman should onli renew her connect with a former lover if she is satisfi that good fortun gain love and friendship are like to be the result of such a re union chapter v of differ kind of gain when a courtesan is abl to realiz much money everi day by reason of mani custom she should not confin herself to a singl lover under such circumst she should fix her rate for one night after consid the place the season and the condit of the peopl and have regard to her own good qualiti and good look and after compar her rate with those of other courtesan she can inform her lover and friend and acquaint about these charg if howev she can obtain a great gain from a singl lover she may resort to him alon and live with him like a wife now the sage are of opinion that when a courtesan has the chanc of an equal gain from two lover at the same time a prefer should be given to the one who would give her the kind of thing which she want but vatsyayana say that the prefer should be given to the one who give her gold becaus it cannot be taken back like some other thing it can be easili receiv and is also the mean of procur anyth that may be wish for of such thing as gold silver copper bell metal iron pot furnitur bed upper garment under vestment fragrant substanc vessel made of gourd ghee oil corn cattl and other thing of a like natur the first viz gold is superior to all the other when the same labour is requir to gain ani two lover or when the same kind of thing is to be got from each of them the choic should be made by the advic of a friend or it may be made from their person qualiti or from the sign of good or bad fortun that may be connect with them when there are two lover one of whom is attach to the courtesan and the other is simpli veri generous the sage say that the prefer should be given to the generous lover but vatsyayana is of opinion that the one who is realli attach to the courtesan should be prefer becaus he can be made to be generous even as a miser give money if he becom fond of a woman but a man who is simpli generous cannot be made to love with real attach but among those who are attach to her if there is one who is poor and one who is rich the prefer is of cours to be given to the latter when there are two lover one of whom is generous and the other readi to do ani servic for the courtesan some sage say that the one who is readi to do the servic should be prefer but vatsyayana is of opinion that a man who doe a servic think that he has gain his object when he has done someth onc but a generous man doe not care for what he has given befor even here the choic should be guid by the likelihood of the futur good to be deriv from her union with either of them when one of the two lover is grate and the other liber some sage say that the liber one should be prefer but vatsyayana is of opinion that the former should be chosen becaus liber men are general haughti plain spoken and want in consider toward other even though these liber men have been on friend term for a long time yet if they see ani fault in the courtesan or are told lie about her by some other women they do not care for past servic but leav abrupt on the other hand the grate man doe not at onc break off from her on account of a regard for the pain she may have taken to pleas him in this case also the choic is to be guid with respect to what may happen in futur when an occas for compli with the request of a friend and a chanc of get money come togeth the sage say that the chanc of get money should be prefer but vatsyayana think that the money can be obtain to morrow as well as to day but if the request of a friend be not at onc compli with he may becom disaffect even here in make the choic regard must be paid to futur good fortun on such an occas howev the courtesan might pacifi her friend by pretend to have some work to do and tell him that his request will be compli with next day and in this way secur the chanc of get the money that has been offer her when the chanc of get money and the chanc of avoid some disast come at the same time the sage are of opinion that the chanc of get money should be prefer but vatsyayana say that money has onli a limit import while a disast that is onc avert may never occur again here howev the choic should be guid by the great or small of the disast the gain of the wealthiest and best kind of courtesan are to be spent as follow build templ tank and garden give a thousand cow to differ brahman carri on the worship of the god and celebr festiv in their honour and last perform such vow as may be within their mean the gain of other courtesan are to be spent as follow have a white dress to wear everi day get suffici food and drink to satisfi hunger and thirst eat daili a perfum tambula ie a mixtur of betel nut and betel leav and wear ornament gilt with gold the sage say that these repres the gain of all the middl and lower class of courtesan but vatsyayana is of opinion that their gain cannot be calcul or fix in ani way as these depend on the influenc of the place the custom of the peopl their own appear and mani other thing when a courtesan want to keep some particular man from some other woman or want to get him away from some woman to whom he may be attach or to depriv some woman of the gain realiz by her from him or if she think that she would rais her posit or enjoy some great good fortun or becom desir to all men by unit herself with this man or if she wish to get his assist in avert some misfortun or is realli attach to him and love him or wish to injur somebodi through his mean or has regard to some former favour confer upon her by him or wish to be unit with him mere from desir or ani of the abov reason she should agre to take from him onli a small sum of money in a friend way when a courtesan intend to abandon a particular lover and take up with anoth one or when she has reason to believ that her lover will short leav her and return to his wive or that have squander all his money and becam penniless his guardian or master or father would come and take him away or that her lover is about to lose his posit or last that he is of a veri fickl mind she should under ani of these circumst endeavour to get as much money as she can from him as soon as possibl on the other hand when the courtesan think that her lover is about to receiv valuabl present or get a place of author from the king or be near the time of inherit a fortun or that his ship would soon arriv laden with merchandis or that he has larg stock of corn and other commod or that if anyth was done for him it would not be done in vain or that he is alway true to his word then should she have regard to her futur welfar and live with the man like a wife there are also vers on the subject as follow in consid her present gain and her futur welfar a courtesan should avoid such person as have gain their mean of subsist with veri great difficulti as also those who have becom selfish and hard heart by becom the favourit of king she should make everi endeavour to unit herself with prosper and well to do peopl and with those whom it is danger to avoid or to slight in ani way even at some cost to herself she should becom acquaint with energet and liber mind men who when pleas would give her a larg sum of money even for veri littl servic or for some small thing chapter vi of gain and loss attend gain and loss and doubt as also of the differ kind of courtesan it sometim happen that while gain are be sought for or expect to be realis that loss onli are the result of our effort the caus of these loss are weak of intellect excess love excess pride excess self conceit excess simplic excess confid excess anger careless reckless influenc of evil genius accident circumst the result of these loss are expens incur without ani result destruct of futur good fortun stoppag of gain about to be realiz loss of what is alreadi obtain acquisit of a sour temper becom unaimi to everi bodi injuri to health loss of hair and other accid now gain is of three kind viz gain of wealth gain of religi merit and gain of pleasur and similar loss is of three kind viz loss of wealth loss of religi merit and loss of pleasur at the time when gain are sought for if other gain come along with them these are call attend gain when gain is uncertain the doubt of it be a gain is call a simpl doubt when there is a doubt whether either of two thing will happen or not it is call a mix doubt if while one thing is be done two result take place it is call a combin of two result and if sever result follow from the same action it is call a combin of result on everi side we shall now give exampl of the abov as alreadi state gain is of three kind and loss which is oppos to gain is also of three kind a when by live with a great man a courtesan acquir present wealth and in addit to this becom acquaint with other peopl and thus obtain a chanc of futur fortun and an access of wealth and becom desir to all this is call a gain of wealth attend by other gain b when by live with a man a courtesan simpli get money this is call a gain of wealth not attend by ani other gain c when a courtesan receiv money from other peopl besid her lover the result are the chanc of the loss of futur good from her present lover the chanc of disaffect of a man secur attach to her the hatr of all and the chanc of a union with some low person tend to destroy her futur good this gain is call a gain of wealth attend by loss d when a courtesan at her own expens and without ani result in the shape of gain has connect with a great man or an avarici minist for the sake of divert some misfortun or remov some caus that may be threaten the destruct of a great gain this loss is said to be a loss of wealth attend by gain of the futur good which it may bring about e when a courtesan is kind even at her own expens to a man who is veri stingi or to a man proud of his look or to an ungrat man skill in gain the heart of other without ani good result from these connect to her in the end this loss is call a loss of wealth not attend by ani gain f when a courtesan is kind to ani such man as describ abov but who in addit are favourit of the king and moreov cruel and power without ani good result in the end and with a chanc of her be turn away at ani moment this loss is call a loss of wealth attend by other loss in this way gain and loss and attend gain and loss in religi merit and pleasur may becom known to the reader and combin of all of them may also be made thus end the remark on gain and loss and attend gain and loss in the next place we come to doubt which are again of three kind viz doubt about wealth doubt about religi merit and doubt about pleasur the follow are exampl a when a courtesan is not certain how much a man may give her or spend upon her this is call a doubt about wealth b when a courtesan feel doubt whether she is right in entir abandon a lover from whom she is unabl to get money she have taken all his wealth from him in the first instanc this doubt is call a doubt about religi merit c when a courtesan is unabl to get hold of a lover to her like and is uncertain whether she will deriv ani pleasur from a person surround by his famili or from a low person this is call a doubt about pleasur d when a courtesan is uncertain whether some power but low principl fellow would caus loss to her on account of her not be civil to him this is call a doubt about the loss of wealth e when a courtesan feel doubt whether she would lose religi merit by abandon a man who is attach to her without give him the slightest favour and therebi caus him unhappi in this world and the next76 this doubt is call a doubt about the loss of a religi merit f when a courtesan is uncertain as to whether she might creat disaffect by speak out and reveal her love and thus not get her desir satisfi this is call a doubt about the loss of pleasur thus end the remark on doubt mix doubt a the intercours or connect with a stranger whose disposit is unknown and who may have been introduc by a lover or by one who possess author may be product either of gain or loss and therefor this is call a mix doubt about the gain and loss of wealth b when a courtesan is request by a friend or is impel by piti to have intercours with a learn brahman a religi student a sacrific a devote or an ascet who may have all fallen in love with her and who may be consequ at the point of death by do this she might either gain or lose religi merit and therefor this is call a mix doubt about the gain and loss of religi merit c if a courtesan reli sole upon the report of other peopl ie hearsay about a man and goe to him without ascertain herself whether he possess good qualiti or not she may either gain or lose pleasur in proport as he may be good or bad and therefor this is call a mix doubt about the gain and loss of pleasur uddalika has describ the gain and loss on both side as follow a if when live with a lover a courtesan get both wealth and pleasur from him it is call a gain on both side b when a courtesan live with a lover at her own expens without get ani profit out of it and the lover even take back from her what he may have former given her it is call a loss on both side c when a courtesan is uncertain whether a new acquaint would becom attach to her and moreov if he becam attach to her whether he would give her ani thing it is then call a doubt on both side about gain d when a courtesan is uncertain whether a former enemi if made up by her at her own expens would do her some injuri on account of his grudg against her or if becom attach to her would take away angrili from her ani thing that he may have given to her this is call a doubt on both side about loss babhravya has describ the gain and loss on both side as follow a when a courtesan can get money from a man whom she may go to see and also money from a man whom she may not go to see this is call a gain on both side b when a courtesan has to incur further expens if she goe to see a man and yet run the risk of incur an irremedi loss if she doe not go to see him this is call a loss on both side c when a courtesan is uncertain whether a particular man would give her anyth on her go to see him without incur expens on her part or whether on her neglect him anoth man would give her someth this is call a doubt on both side about gain d when a courtesan is uncertain whether on go at her own expens to see an old enemi he would take back from her what he may have given her or whether by her not go to see him he would caus some disast to fall upon her this is call a doubt on both side about loss by combin the abov the follow six kind of mix result are produc viz a gain on one side and loss on the other b gain on one side and doubt of gain on the other c gain on one side and doubt of loss on the other d loss on one side and doubt of gain on the other e doubt of gain on one side and doubt of loss on the other f doubt of loss on one side and loss on the other a courtesan have consid all the abov thing and taken council with her friend should act so as to acquir gain the chanc of great gain and the ward off of ani great disast religi merit and pleasur should also be form into separ combin like those of wealth and then all should be combin with each other so as to form new combin when a courtesan consort with men she should caus each of them to give her money as well as pleasur at particular time such as the spring festiv etc she should make her mother announc to the various men that on a certain day her daughter would remain with the man who would gratifi such and such a desir of her when young men approach her with delight she should think of what she may accomplish through them the combin of gain and loss on all side are gain on one side and loss on all other loss on one side and gain on all other gain on all side loss on all side a courtesan should also consid doubt about gain and doubt about loss with refer both to wealth religi merit and pleasur thus end the consider of gain loss attend gain attend loss and doubt the differ kind of courtesan are a bawd a femal attend an unchast woman a danc girl a femal

money from them of pleas them of separ themselv from them and of re unit with them they should also take into consider particular gain and loss attend gain and loss and doubt in accord with their sever condit thus end the consider of courtesan there are also two vers on the subject as follow men want pleasur while women want money and therefor this part which treat of the mean of gain wealth should be studi there are some women who seek for love and there are other who seek for money for the former the way of love are told in previous portion of this work while the way of get money as practis by courtesan are describ in this part footnot footnot 76 the soul of men who die with their desir unfulfil are said to go to the world of the mane and not direct to the suprem spirit =end of part vi= part vii about the mean of attract other to yourself chapter i on person adorn on subjug the heart of other and on tonic medicin when a person fail to obtain the object of his desir by ani of the way previous relat he should then have recours to other way of attract other to himself now good look good qualiti youth and liber are the chief and most natur mean of make a person agreeabl in the eye of other but in the absenc of these a man or a woman must have resort to artifici mean or to art and the follow are some recip that may be found use a an ointment made of the tabernamontana

way if a bead made of the seed of the jujub or of the conch shell be enchant by the incant mention in the atharvana veda or by the incant of those well skill in the scienc of magic and tie on the hand it produc the same result as describ abov i when a femal attend arriv at the age of puberti her master should keep her seclud and when men ardent desir her on account of her seclus and on account of the difficulti of approach her he should then bestow her hand on such a person as may endow her with wealth and happi this is a mean of increas the loveli of a person in the eye of other in the same way when the daughter of a courtesan arriv at the age of puberti the mother should get togeth a lot of young men of the same age disposit and knowledg as her daughter and tell them that she would give her in marriag to the person who would give her present of a particular kind after this the daughter should be kept in seclus as far as possibl and the mother should give her in marriag to the man who

and then invit by her first husband to come and see him she should put asid her present gain and go to him for the night such is the mode of temporari marriag among courtesan and of increas their loveli and their valu in the eye of other what has been said about them should also be understood to appli to the daughter of danc women whose mother should give them onli to such person as are like to becom use to them in various way thus end the way of make oneself love in the eye of other a if a man after anoint his lingam with a mixtur of the powder of the white thorn appl the long pepper and

month in a hole made in the trunk of the sisu tree and are then taken out and made up into an ointment and appli to the lingam this is said to serv as the mean of subjug women g if the bone of a camel is dip into the juic of the plant eclipta prostata and then burnt and the black pigment produc from it ash is place in a box also made of the bone of a camel and appli togeth with antimoni to the eye lash with a pencil also made of the bone of a camel then that pigment is said to be veri pure and wholesom for the eye and serv as a mean of subjug other to the person who use it the same effect can
