requir wander around the labyrinth of laboratori and storeroom search for the secret of telephon switch in machin room trace path of wire or relay in subterranean steam tunnel for some it was common

friend had grown up with a specif relationship to the world wherein thing had mean onli if you found out how they work and how would you go about that if not by get your hand on them it was in the basement of build 26 that samson and his friend discov the eam room build 26 was a long glass and steel structur one of mit newer build contrast with the vener pillar structur that front the institut on massachusett avenu in the basement of this build void of person the eam room electron account machineri a room that hous machin which ran like comput not mani peopl in 1959 had even seen a comput let alon touch one samson a wiri cur hair redhead with a way of extend his vowel so that it would seem he was race through list of possibl mean of statement in mid word had view comput on his visit to mit from his hometown of lowel massachusett less than thirti mile from campus this made him a cambridg urchin one of dozen of scienc crazi high schooler in the region who were drawn as if by gravit pull to the cambridg campus he had even tri to rig up his own comput with discard part of old pinbal machin they were the best sourc of logic element he could find logic element the term seem to encapsul what drew peter samson son of a mill machineri repairman to electron the subject made sens when you grow up with an insati curios as to how thing work the delight you find upon discov someth as eleg as circuit logic where all connect have to complet their loop is profound thrill peter samson who earli on appreci the mathemat simplic of these thing could recal see a televis show on boston public tv channel wgbh which gave a rudimentari introduct to program a comput in it own languag it fire his imagin to peter samson a comput was sure like aladdin lamprub it and it would do your bid so he tri to learn more about the field built machin of his own enter scienc project competit and contest and went to the place that peopl of his ilk aspir to mit the repositori of the veri brightest of those weird high school kid with owl like glass and underdevelop pector who dazzl math teacher and flunk pe who dream not of score on prom night but of get to the final of the general electr scienc fair competit mit where he would wander the hallway at two oclock in the morn look for someth interest and where he would inde discov someth that would help draw him deepli into a new form of creativ process and a new life style and would put him into the forefront of a societi envis onli by a few scienc fiction writer of mild disreput he would discov a comput that he could play with the eam room which samson had chanc on was load with larg keypunch machin the size of squat file cabinet no one was protect them the room was staf onli by day when a select group who had attain offici clearanc were privileg enough to submit long manila card to oper who would then use these machin to punch hole in them accord to what data the privileg one want enter on the card a hole in the card would repres some instruct to the comput tell it to put a piec of data somewher or perform a function on a piec of data or move a piec of data from one place to anoth an entir stack of these card made one comput program a program be a seri of instruct which yield some expect result just as the instruct in a recip when precis follow lead to a cake those card would be taken to yet anoth oper upstair who would feed the card into a reader that would note where the hole were and dispatch this inform to the ibm 704 comput on the first floor of build 26 the hulk giant the ibm 704 cost sever million dollar took up an entir room need constant attent from a cadr of profession machin oper and requir special air condit so that the glow vacuum tube insid it would not heat up to data destroy temperatur when the air condit broke downa fair common occurrencesa loud gong would sound and three engin would spring from a nearbi offic to frantic take cover off the machin so it innard wouldnt melt all these peopl in charg of punch card feed them into reader and press button and switch on the machin were what was common call a priesthood and those privileg enough to submit data to those most holi priest were the offici acolyt it was an almost ritualist exchang acolyt oh machin would you accept my offer of inform so you may run my program and perhap give me a comput priest on behalf of the machin we will tri we promis noth as a general rule even these most privileg of acolyt were not allow direct access to the machin itself and they would not be abl to see for hour sometim for day the result of the machin ingest of their batch of card this was someth samson knew and of cours it frustrat the hell out of samson who want to get at the damn machin for this was what life was all about what samson did not know and was delight to discov was that the eam room also had a particular keypunch machin call the 407 not onli could it punch card but it could also read card sort them and print them on list no one seem to be guard these machin which were comput sort of of cours use them would be no picnic one need to actual wire up what was call a plug board a two inch by two inch plastic squar with a mass of hole in it if you put hundr of wire through the hole in a certain order you would get someth that look like a rat nest but would fit into this electromechan machin and alter it person it could do what you want it to do so without ani author whatsoev that is what peter samson set out to do along with a few friend of his from an mit organ with a special interest in model railroad it was a casual unthink step into a scienc fiction futur but that was typic of the way that an odd subcultur was pull itself up by it bootstrap and grow to underground prominenceto becom a cultur that would be the impolit unsanct soul of computerdom it was among the first comput hacker escapad of the tech model railroad club or tmrc peter samson had been a member of the tech model railroad club sinc his first week at mit in the fall of 1958 the first event that enter mit freshmen attend was a tradit welcom lectur the same one that had been given for as long as anyon at mit could rememb look at the person to your left look at the person to your right one of you three will not graduat from the institut the intend effect of the speech was to creat that horrid feel in the back of the collect freshman throat that signal unpreced dread all their live these freshmen had been almost exempt from academ pressur the exempt had been earn by virtu of brillianc now each of them had a person to the right and a person to the left who was just as smart mayb even smarter but to certain student this was no challeng at all to these youngster classmat were perceiv in a sort of friend haze mayb they would be of assist in the consum quest to find out how thing work and then to master them there were enough obstacl to learn alreadywhi bother with stupid thing like brown nose teacher and strive for grade to student like peter samson the quest meant more than the degre sometim after the lectur came freshman midway all the campus organizationsspeci interest group fratern and such set up booth in a larg gymnasium to tri to recruit new member the group that snag peter was the tech model railroad club it member bright eye and crew cut upperclassmen who spoke with the spasmod cadenc of peopl who want word out of the way in a hurri boast a spectacular display of ho gaug train they had in a perman clubroom in build 20 peter samson had long been fascin by train especi subway so he went along on the walk tour to the build a shingl clad temporari structur built dure world war ii the hallway were cavern and even though the clubroom was on the second floor it had the dank dim lit feel of a basement the clubroom was domin by the huge train layout it just about fill the room and if you stood in the littl control area call the notch you could see a littl town a littl industri area a tini work trolley line a papier mach mountain and of cours a lot of train and track the train were meticul craft to resembl their full scale counterpart and they chug along the twist and turn of track with pictur book perfect and then peter samson look underneath the chest high board which held the layout it took his breath away underneath this layout was a more massiv matrix of wire and relaysand crossbar switch than peter samson had ever dream exist there were neat regiment line of switch and ach regular row of dull bronz relay and a long rambl tangl of red blue and yellow wirestwist and twirl like a rainbow color explos of einstein hair it was an incred complic system and peter samson vow to find out how it work the tech model railroad club award it member a key to the clubroom after they log forti hour of work on the layout freshman midway had been on a friday by monday peter samson had his key there were two faction of tmrc some member love the idea of spend their time build and paint replica of certain train with histor and emot valu or creat realist sceneri for the layout this was the knife and paintbrush conting and it subscrib to railroad magazin and book the club for trip on age train line the other faction center on the signal and power subcommitte of the club and it care far more about what went on under the layout this was the system which work someth like a collabor between rube goldberg and wernher von braun and it was constant be improv revamp perfect and sometim gronkedin club jargon screw up sandp peopl were obsess with the way the system work it increas complex how ani chang you made would affect other part and how you could put those relationship between the part to optim use mani of the part for the system had been donat by the western electr colleg gift plan direct from the phone compani the club faculti advisor was also in charg of the campus phone system and had seen to it that sophist phone equip was avail for the model railroad use that equip as a start point the railroad had devis a scheme which enabl sever peopl to control train at onc even if the train were at differ part of the same track use dial appropri from telephon the tmrc engin could specifi which block of track they want control of and run a train from there this was done by use sever type of phone compani relay includ crossbar executor and step switch which let you actual hear the power be transfer from one block to anoth by an other world chunka chunka chunka sound it was the sandp group who devis this fiendish ingeni scheme and it was the sandp group who harbor the kind of restless curios which led them to root around campus build in search of way to get their hand on comput they were lifelong discipl of a hand on imper head of sandp was an upperclassman name bob saunder with ruddi bulbous featur an infecti laugh and a talent for switch gear as a child in chicago he had built a high frequenc transform for a high school project it was his six foot high version of a tesla coil someth devis by an engin in the 1800s which was suppos to send out furious wave of electr power saunder said his coil project manag to blow out televis recept for

computerth exhilar of that experi help him decid to enter mit in his freshman year he earn a reput as one of tmrcs most capabl sandp peopl the sandp peopl were the one who spent saturday go to eli heffron junkyard in somervill scroung for part who would spend hour on their back rest on littl roll chair they call bunki to get underneath tight spot in the switch system who would work through the night make the wholli unauthor connect between the tmrc phone and the east campus technolog was their playground the core member hung out at the club for hour constant improv the system argu about what could be done next develop a jargon of their own that seem incomprehens to outsid who might chanc on these teen age fanat with their check short sleev shirt pencil in their pocket chino pant and alway a bottl of coca cola by their side tmrc purchas it own coke machin for the then forbid sum of 165 at a tariff of five cent a bottl the outlay was replac in three month to facilit sale saunder built a chang machin for coke buyer that was still in use a decad later when a piec of equip wasnt work it was lose when a piec of equip was ruin it was mung mash until no good the two desk in the corner of the room were not call the offic but the orific one who insist on studi for cours was a tool garbag was call cruft and a project undertaken or a product built not sole to fulfil some construct goal but with some wild pleasur taken in mere involv was call a hack this latter term may have been suggest by ancient mit lingo the word hack had long been use to describ the elabor colleg prank that mit student would regular devis such as cover the dome that overlook the campus with reflect foil but as the tmrc peopl use the word there was serious respect impli while someon might call a clever connect between relay a mere hack it would be understood that to qualifi as a hack the feat must be imbu with innov style and technic virtuos even though one might self deprec say he was hack away at the system much as an axe wielder hack at log the artistri with which one hack was recogn to be consider the most product peopl work on signal and power call themselv hacker with great pride within the confin of the clubroom in build 20 and of the tool room where some studi and mani techno bull session took place they had unilater endow themselv with the heroic attribut of iceland legend

what the electromechan counter could do take it to it limit that spring of 1959 a new cours was offer at mit it was the first cours in program a comput that freshmen could take the teacher was a distant man with a wild shock of hair and an equal unruli beardjohn mccarthi a master mathematician mccarthi was a classic absent mind professor stori abound about his habit of sudden answer a question hour sometim even day after it was first pose to him he would approach you in the hallway and with no salut would begin speak in his robot precis diction as if the paus in convers had been onli a fraction of a second and not a week most like his belat respons would be brilliant mccarthi was one of a veri few peopl work in an entir new form of scientif inquiri with comput the volatil and controversi natur of his field of studi was obvious from the veri arrog of the name that mccarthi had bestow upon it artifici intellig this man actual thought that comput could be smart even at such a scienc intens place as mit most peopl consid the thought ridicul they consid comput to be use if somewhat absurd expens tool for number crunch huge calcul and for devis missil defens system as mit largest comput the whirlwind had done for the earli warn sage system but scof at the thought that comput themselv could actual be a scientif field of studi comput scienc did not offici exist at mit in the late fifti and mccarthi and his fellow comput specialist work in the electr engin depart which offer the cours no 641 that kotok samson and a few other trmc member took that spring mccarthi had start a mammoth program on the ibm 704the hulk giantthat would give it the extraordinari abil to play chess to critic of the bud field of artifici intellig this was just one exampl of the bonehead optim of peopl like john mccarthi but mccarthi had a certain vision of what comput could do and play chess was onli the begin all fascin stuff but not the vision that was drive kotok and samson and the other they want to learn how to work the damn machin and while this new program languag call lisp that mccarthi was talk about in 641 was interest it was not near as interest as the act of program or that fantast moment when you got your printout back from the priesthoodword from the sourc itselfand could then spend hour pore over the result of the program what had gone wrong with it how it could be improv the tmrc hacker were devis way to get into closer contact with the ibm 704 which soon was upgrad to a newer model call the 709 by hang out at the comput center in the wee hour of the morn and by get to know the priesthood and by bow and scrape the requisit number of time peopl like kotok were eventu allow to push a few button on the machin and watch the light as it work there were secret to those ibm machin that had been painstak learn by some of the older peopl at mit with access to the 704 and friend among the priesthood amaz a few of these programm grad student work with mccarthi had even written a program that util one of the row of tini light the light would be lit in such an order that it look like a littl ball was be pass from right to left if an oper hit a switch at just the right time the motion of the light could be reversedcomput ping pong this obvious was the kind of thing that youd show off to impress your peer who would then take a look at the actual program you had written and see how it was done to top the program someon els might tri to do the same thing with fewer instructionsa worthi endeavor sinc there was so littl room in the small memori of the comput of those day that not mani instruct could fit into them john mccarthi had onc notic how his graduat student who loiter around the 704 would work over their comput program to get the most out of the fewest instruct and get the program compress so that fewer card would need to be fed to the machin shave off an instruct or two was almost an obsess with them mccarthi compar these student to ski bum they got the same kind of primal thrill from maxim code as fanat skier got from swoosh frantic down a hill so the practic of take a comput program and tri to cut off instruct without affect the outcom came to be call program bum and you would often hear peopl mumbl thing like mayb i can bum a few instruct out and get the octal correct card loader down to three card instead of four mccarthi in 1959 was turn his interest from chess to a new way of talk to the comput the whole new languag call lisp alan kotok and his friend were more than eager to take over the chess project work on the batch process ibm they embark on the gargantuan project of teach the 704 and later the 709 and even after that it replac the 7090 how to play the game of king eventu kotok group becam the largest user of comput time in the entir mit comput center still work with the ibm machin was frustrat there was noth wors than the long wait between the time you hand in your card and the time your result were hand back to you if you had misplac as much as one letter in one instruct the program would crash and you would have to start the whole process over again it went hand in hand with the stifl prolifer of goddamn rule that permeat the atmospher of the comput center most of the rule were design to keep crazi young comput fan like samson and kotok and saunder physic distant from the machin itself the most rigid rule of all was that no one should be abl to actual touch or tamper with the machin itself this of cours was what those signal and power peopl were die to do more than anyth els in the world and the restrict drove them mad one priesta low level sub priest reallyon the late night shift was particular nasti in enforc this rule so samson devis a suitabl reveng while poke around at eli electron junk shop one day he chanc upon an electr board precis like the kind of board hold the clunki vacuum tube which resid insid the ibm one night sometim befor 4 am this particular sub priest step out for a minut when he return samson told him that the machin wasnt work but theyd found the troubleand held up the total smash modul from the old 704 hed gotten at eli the sub priest could hard get the word out w where did you get that samson who had wide green eye that could easili look maniac slowli point to an open place on the machin rack where of cours no board had ever been but the space still look sad bare the sub priest gasp he made face that indic his bowel were about to give out he whimper exhort to the deiti vision no doubt of a million dollar deduct from his paycheck began flash befor him onli after his supervisor a high priest with some understand of the mental of these young wiseguy from the model railroad club came and explain the situat did he calm down he was not the last administr to feel the wrath of a hacker thwart in the quest for access one day a former tmrc member who was now on the mit faculti paid a visit to the clubroom his name was jack denni when he had been an undergradu in the earli 1950s he had work furious underneath the layout denni late had been work a comput which mit had just receiv from lincoln lab a militari develop laboratori affili with the institut the comput was call the tx 0 and it was one of the first transistor run comput in the world lincoln lab had use it specif to test a giant comput call the tx 2 which had a memori so complex that onli with this special built littl brother could it ill be capabl diagnos now that it origin job was over the three million dollar tx 0 had been ship over to the institut on long term loan and appar no one at lincoln lab had mark a calendar with a return date denni ask the sandp peopl at tmrc whether they would like to see it hey you nun would you like to meet the pope the tx 0 was in build 26 in the second floor radio laboratori of electron rle direct abov the first floor comput center which hous the hulk ibm 704 the rle lab resembl the control room of an antiqu spaceship the tx 0 or tixo as it was sometim call was for it time a midget machin sinc it was one of the first comput to use finger size transistor instead of hand size vacuum tube still it took up much of the room along with it fifteen ton of support air condit equip the tx os work were mount on sever tall thin chassi like rug metal bookshelv with tangl wire and neat littl row of tini bottl like contain in which the transistor were insert anoth rack had a solid metal front speckl with grim look gaug face the rack was an l shape consol the control panel of this h g well spaceship with a blue countertop for your elbow and paper on the short arm of the l stood a flexowrit which resembl a typewrit convert for tank warfar it bottom anchor in a militari gray hous abov the top were the control panel boxlik protrus paint an institut yellow on the side of the box which face the user were a few gaug sever line of quarter inch blink light a matrix of steel toggl switch the size of larg grain of rice and best of all an actual cathod ray tube display round and smoke gray the tmrc peopl were awe this machin did not use card the user would first punch in a program onto a long thin paper tape with a flexowrit there were a few extra flexowrit in an adjoin room then sit at the consol feed in the program by run the tape through a reader and be abl to sit there while the program ran if someth went wrong with the program you knew immedi and you could diagnos the problem by use some of the switch or check out which of the light were blink or lit the comput even had an audio output while the program ran a speaker underneath the consol would make a sort of music like a poor tune electr organ whose note would vibrat with a fuzzi ether din the chord on this organ would chang depend on what data the machin was read at ani given microsecond after you were familiar with the tone you could actual hear what part of your program the comput was work on you would have to discern this though over the clack of the flexowrit which could make you think you were in the middl of a machin gun battl even more amaz was that becaus of these interact capabl and also becaus user seem to be allow block of time to use the tx 0 all by themselv you could even modifi a program while sit at the comput a miracl there was no way in hell that kotok saunder samson and the other were go to be kept away from that machin fortun there didnt seem to be the kind of bureaucraci surround the tx 0 that there was around the ibm 704 no cadr of offici priest the technician in charg was a canni white hair scotsman name john mckenzi while he made sure that graduat student and those work on fund project offici sanction usersmaintain access to the machin mckenzi toler the crew of tmrc madmen who began to hang out in the rle lab where the tx 0 stood samson kotok saunder and a freshman name bob wagner soon figur out that the best time of all to hang out in build 26 was at night when no person in his right mind would have sign up for an hour long session on the piec of paper post everi friday besid the air condition in the rle lab the tx 0 as a rule was kept run twenti four hour a daycomput back then were too expens for their time to be wast by leav them idl through the night and besid it was a hairi procedur to get the thing up and run onc it was turn off so the tmrc hacker who soon were refer to themselv as tx 0 hacker chang their life style to accommod the comput they laid claim to what block of time they could and would vultur time with nocturn visit to the lab on the off chanc that someon who was schedul for a 3 am session might not show up oh samson would say delight a minut or so after someon fail to show up at the time design in the logbook make sure it doesnt go to wast it never seem to becaus the hacker were there almost all the time if they werent in the rle lab wait for an open to occur they were in the classroom next to the tmrc clubroom the tool room play a hangman style word game that samson had devis call come next door wait for a call from someon who was near the tx 0 monitor it to see if someon had not shown up for a session the hacker recruit a network of inform to give advanc notic of potenti open at the computerif a research project was not readi with it program in time or a professor was sick the word would be pass to tmrc and the hacker would appear at the tx 0 breathless and readi to jam into the space behind the consol though jack denni was theoret in charg of the oper denni was teach cours at the time and prefer to spend the rest of his time actual write code for the machin denni play the role of benevol godfath to the hacker he would give them a brief hand on introduct to the machin point them in certain direct be amus at their wild program ventur he had littl tast for administr though and was just as happi to let john mckenzi run thing mckenzi earli on recogn that the interact natur of the tx 0 was inspir a new form of comput program and the hacker were it pioneer so he did not lay down too mani edict the atmospher was loos enough in 1959 to accommod the straysscienc mad peopl whose curios burn like a hunger who like peter samson would be explor the unchart maze of laboratori at mit the nois of the air condit the audio output and the drill hammer flexowrit would lure these wander whod poke their head into the lab like kitten peer into basket of yarn one of those wander was an outsid name peter deutsch even befor discov the tx 0 deutsch had develop a fascin for comput it began one day when he pick up a manual that someon had discard a manual for an obscur form of comput languag for do calcul someth about the orderli of the comput instruct appeal to him he would later describ the feel as the same kind of eerili transcend recognit that an artist experi when he discov the medium that is absolut right for him this is where i belong deutsch tri write a small program and sign up for time under the name of one of the priest ran it on a comput within week he had attain a strike profici in program he was onli twelv year old he was a shi kid strong in math and unsur of most everyth els he was uncomfort overweight defici in sport but an intellectu star perform his father was a professor at mit and peter use that as his entre to explor the lab it was inevit that he would be drawn to the tx 0 he first wander into the small kluge room a kluge is a piec of ineleg construct equip that seem to defi logic by work proper where three off line flexowrit were avail for punch program onto paper tape which would later be fed into the tx 0 someon was busi punch in a tape peter watch for a while then began bombard the poor soul with question about that weird look littl comput in the next room then peter went up to the tx 0 itself examin it close note how it differ from other comput it was smaller had a crt display and other neat toy he decid right then to act as if he had a perfect right to be there he got hold of a manual and soon was startl peopl by spout actual make sens comput talk and eventu was allow to sign up for night and weekend session and to write his own program mckenzi worri that someon might accus him of run some sort of summer camp with this short pant littl kid bare tall enough to stick his head over the tx os consol stare at the code that an offici sanction user perhap some self import graduat student would be hammer into the flexowrit and say in his squeaki preadolesc voic someth like your problem is that this credit is wrong over here you need this other instruct over there and the self import grad student would go crazywho is this littl wormand start scream at him to go out and play somewher invari though peter deutsch comment would turn out to be correct deutsch would also brazen announc that he was go to write better program than the one current avail and he would go and do it samson kotok and the other hacker accept peter deutsch by virtu of his comput knowledg he was worthi of equal treatment deutsch was not such a favorit with the offici sanction user especi when he sat behind them readi to spring into action when they made a mistak on the flexowrit these offici sanction user appear at the tx 0 with the regular of commut the program they ran were statist analys cross correl simul of an interior of the nucleus of a cell applic that was fine for user but it was sort of a wast in the mind of the hacker what hacker had in mind was get behind the consol of the tx 0 much in the same way as get in behind the throttl of a plane or as peter samson a classic music fan put it comput with the tx 0 was like play a music instrument an absurd expens music instrument upon which you could improvis compos and like the beatnik in harvard squar a mile away wail like a banshe with total creativ abandon one thing that enabl them to do this was the program system devis by jack denni and anoth professor tom stockman when the tx 0 arriv at mit it had been strip down sinc it day at lincoln lab the memori had been reduc consider to 4096 word of eighteen bit each a bit is a binari digit either a one or zero these binari number are the onli thing comput understand a seri of binari number is call a word and the tx 0 had almost no softwar so jack denni even befor he introduc the tmrc peopl to the tx 0 had been write system programsth softwar to help user util the machin the first thing denni work on was an assembl this was someth that translat assembl languagewhich use three letter symbol abbrevi that repres instruct to the machineinto machin languag which consist of the binari number 0 and 1 the tx 0 had a rather limit assembl languag sinc it design allow onli two bit of each eighteen bit word to be use for instruct to the comput onli four instruct could be use each possibl two bit variation00 0 1 10 and 11repres an instruct everyth the comput did could be broken down to the execut of one of those four instruct it took one instruct to add two number but a seri of perhap twenti instruct to multipli two number stare at a long list of comput command written as binari numbersfor exampl 10011001100001 could make you into a babbl mental case in a matter of minut but the same command in assembl languag might look like this add y after load the comput with the assembl that denni wrote you could write program in this simpler symbol form and wait smug while the comput did the translat into binari for you then youd feed that binari object code back into the comput the valu of this was incalcul it enabl programm to write in someth that look like code rather than an endless dizzi seri of one and zero the other program that denni work on with stockman was someth even newera debugg the tx 0 came with a debug program call ut 3 which enabl you to talk to the comput while it was run by type command direct into the flexowrit but it had terribl problem for one thing it onli accept type in code that use the octal numer system octal is a base eight number system as oppos to binari which is base two and arabicour which is base ten and it is a difficult system to use so denni and stockman decid to write someth better than ut 3 which would enabl user to use the symbol easier to work with assembl languag this came to be call flit and it allow user to actual find program bug dure a session fix them and keep the program run denni would explain that flit stood for flexowrit interrog tape but clear the name real origin was the insect spray with that brand name flit was a quantum leap forward sinc it liber programm to actual do origin compos on the machinejust like musician compos on their music instrument with the use of the debugg which took up one third of the 4096 word of the tx os memori hacker were free to creat a new more dare style of program and what did these hacker program do well sometim it didnt matter much at all what they did peter samson hack the night away on a program that would instant convert arab number to roman numer and jack denni after admir the skill with which samson had accomplish this feat said my god whi would anyon want to do such a thing but denni knew whi there was ampl justif in the feel of power and accomplish samson got when he fed in the paper tape monitor the light and switch and saw what were onc plain old blackboard arab number come back as the numer the roman had hack with in fact it was jack denni who suggest to samson that there were consider use for the tx os abil to send nois to the audio speaker while there were no built in control for pitch amplitud or tone charact there was a way to control the speakersound would be emit depend on the state of the fourteenth bit in the eighteen bit word the tx 0 had in it accumul in a given microsecond the sound was on or off depend on whether bit fourteen was a one or zero so samson set about write program that vari the binari number in that slot in differ way to produc differ pitch at that time onli a few peopl in the countri had been experi with use a comput to output ani kind of music and the method they had been use requir massiv comput befor the machin would so much as utter a note samson who react with impati to those who warn he was attempt the imposs want a comput play music right away so he learn to control that one bit in the accumul so adept that he could command it with the author of charli parker on the saxophon in a later version of this music compil samson rig it so that if you made an error in your program syntax the flexowrit would switch to a red ribbon and print to err is human to forgiv divin when outsid heard the melodi of johann sebastian bach in a singl voic monophon squar wave no harmoni they were univers unfaz big deal three million dollar for this giant hunk of machineri and whi shouldnt it do at least as much as a five dollar toy piano it was no use to explain to these outsid that peter samson had virtual bypass the process by which music had been made for eon music had alway been made by direct creat vibrat that were sound what happen in samson program was that a load of number bit of inform fed into a comput compris a code in which the music resid you could spend hour stare at the code and not be abl to divin where the music was it onli becam music while million of blind brief exchang of data were take place in the accumul sit in one of the metal wire and silicon rack that compris the tx 0 samson had ask the comput which had no appar knowledg of how to use a voic to lift itself in songand the tx 0 had compli so it was that a comput program was not onli metaphor a music compositionit was liter a music composit it look likeand wasth same kind of program which yield complex arithmet comput and statist analys these digit that samson had jam into the comput were a univers languag which could produc anythinga bach fugu or an anti aircraft system samson did not say ani of this to the outsid who were unimpress by his feat nor did the hacker themselv discuss thisit is not even clear that they analyz the phenomenon in such cosmic term peter samson did it and his colleagu appreci it becaus it was obvious a neat hack that was justif enough to hacker like bob saundersbald plump and merri discipl of the tx 0 presid of tmrcs sandp group student of system it was a perfect exist saunder had grown up in the suburb of chicago and for as long as he could rememb the work of electr and telephon circuitri had fascin him befor begin mit saunder had land a dream summer job work for the phone compani instal central offic equip he would spend eight bliss hour with solder iron and plier in hand work in the bowel of various system an idyl broken by lunch hour spent in deep studi of phone compani manual it was the phone compani equip underneath the tmrc layout that had convinc saunder to becom activ in the model railroad club saunder be an upperclassman had come to the tx 0 later in his colleg career than kotok and samson he had use the breath space to actual lay the foundat for a social life which includ courtship of and eventu marriag to marg french who had done some non hack comput work for a research project still the tx 0 was the center of his colleg career and he share the common hacker experi of see his grade suffer from miss class it didnt bother him much becaus he knew that his real educ was occur in room 240 of build 26 behind the tixo consol year later he would describ himself and the other as an elit group other peopl were off studi spend their day up on four floor build make obnoxi vapor or off in the physic lab throw particl at thing or whatev it is they do and we were simpli not pay attent to what other folk were do becaus we had no interest in it they were studi what they were studi and we were studi what we were studi and the fact that much of it was not on the offici approv curriculum was by and larg immateri the hacker came out at night it was the onli way to take full advantag of the crucial off hour of the tx 0 dure the day saunder would usual manag to make an appear in a class or two then some time spent perform basic maintenanceth like eat and go to the bathroom he might see marg for a while but eventu he would filter over to build 26 he would go over some of the program of the night befor print on the nine and a half inch wide paper that the flexowrit use he would annot and modifi the list to updat the code to whatev he consid the next stage of oper mayb then he would move over to the model railroad club and hed swap his program with someon check simultan for good idea and potenti bug then back to build 26 to the kluge room next to the tx 0 to find an off line flexowrit on which to updat his code all the while hed be check to see if someon had cancel a one hour session on the machin his own session was schedul at someth like two or three in the morn hed wait in the kluge room or play some bridg back at the railroad club until the time came sit at the consol face the metal rack that held the comput transistor each transistor repres a locat that either held or did not hold a bit of memori saunder would set up the flexowrit which would greet him with the word walrus this was someth samson had hack in honor of lewi carrol poem with the line the time has come the walrus said saunder might chuckl at that as he went into the drawer for the paper tape which held the assembl program and fed that into the tape reader now the comput would be readi to assembl his program so hed take the flexowrit tape hed been work on and send that into the comput hed watch the light go on as the comput switch his code from sourc the symbol assembl languag to object code binari which the comput would punch out into anoth paper tape sinc that tape was in the object code that the tx 0 understood hed feed it in hope that the program would run magnific there would most probabl be a few fellow hacker kibitz behind him laugh and joke and drink coke and eat some junk food theyd extract from the machin downstair saunder prefer the lemon jelli wedg that the other call lemon gunki but at four in the morn anyth tast good they would all watch as the program began to run the light go on the whine from the speaker hum in high or low regist depend on what was in bit 14 in the accumul and the first thing hed see on the crt display after the program had been assembl and run was that the program had crash so hed reach into the drawer for the tape with the flit debugg and feed that into the comput the comput would then be a debug machin and hed send the program back in now he could start tri to find out where thing had gone wrong and mayb if he was lucki hed find out and chang thing by put in some command by flick some of the switch on the consol in precis order or hammer in some code on the flexowrit onc thing got runningand it was alway incred satisfi when someth work when hed made that room of transistor and wire and metal and electr all meld togeth to creat a precis output that hed devisedh tri to add the next advanc to it when the hour was oversomeon alreadi itch to get on the machin after himsaund would be readi to spend the next few hour figur out what the heck had made the program go belli up the peak hour itself was tremend intens but dure the hour befor and even dure the hour afterward a hacker attain a state of pure concentr when you program a comput you had to be awar of where all the thousand of bit of inform were go from one instruct to the next and be abl to predictand exploitth effect of all that movement when you had all that inform glu to your cerebr be it was almost as if your own mind had merg into the environ of the comput sometim it took hour to build up to the point where your thought could contain that total pictur and when you did get to that point it was such a shame to wast it that you tri to sustain it by marathon burst altern work on the comput or pore over the code that you wrote on one of the off line flexowrit in the kluge room you would sustain that concentr by wrap around to the next day inevit that frame of mind spill over to what random shard of exist the hacker had outsid of comput the knife and paintbrush conting at tmrc were not pleas at all by the infiltr of tixo mania into the club they saw it as a sort of trojan hors for a switch in the club focus from railroad to comput and if you attend one of the club meet held everi tuesday at five fifteen you could see the concern the hacker would exploit everi possibl thread of parliamentari procedur to creat a meet as convolut as the program they were hack on the tx 0 motion were made to make motion to make motion and object rule out of order as if they were so mani comput error a note in the minut of the meet on novemb 24 1959 suggest that we frown on certain member who would do the club a lot more good by do more sandp ing and less read robert rule of order samson was one of the worst offend and at one point an exasper tmrc member made a motion to purchas a cork for samson oral diarrhea hack parliamentari procedur was one thing but the logic mind frame requir for program spill over into more commonplac activ you could ask a hacker a question and sens his mental accumul process bit until he came up with a precis answer to the question you ask marg saunder would drive to the safeway everi saturday morn in the volkswagen and upon her return ask her husband would you like to help me bring in the groceri bob saunder would repli no stun marg would drag in the groceri herself after the same thing occur a few time she explod hurl curs at him and demand to know whi he said no to her question that a stupid question to ask he said of cours i wont like to help you bring in the groceri if you ask me if ill help you bring them in that anoth matter it was as if marg had submit a program into the tx 0 and the program as program do when the syntax is improp had crash it was not until she debug her question that bob saunder would allow it to run success on his own mental comput chapter 2 the hacker ethic someth new was coalesc around the tx 0 a new way of life with a philosophi an ethic and a dream there was no one moment when it start to dawn on the tx 0 hacker that by devot their technic abil to comput with a devot rare seen outsid of monasteri they were the vanguard of a dare symbiosi between man and machin with a fervor like that of young hot rodder fixat on soup up engin they came to take their almost uniqu surround for grant even as the element of a cultur were form as legend began to accru as their masteri of program start to surpass ani previous record level of skill the dozen or so hacker were reluct to acknowledg that their tini societi on intim term with the tx 0 had been slowli and implicit piec togeth a bodi of concept belief and more the precept of this revolutionari hacker ethic were not so much debat and discuss as silent agre upon no manifesto were issu no missionari tri to gather convert the comput did the convert and those who seem to follow the hacker ethic most faith were peopl like samson saunder and kotok whose live befor mit seem to be mere prelud to that moment when they fulfil themselv behind the consol of the tx 0 later there would come hacker who took the implicit ethic even more serious than the tx 0 hacker did hacker like the legendari greenblatt or gosper though it would be some year yet befor the tenet of hacker would be explicit delin still even in the day of the tx 0 the plank of the platform were in place the hacker ethic access to computersand anyth which might teach you someth about the way the world worksshould be unlimit and total alway yield to the hand on imper hacker believ that essenti lesson can be learn about the systemsabout the worldfrom take thing apart see how they work and use this knowledg to creat new and even more interest thing they resent ani person physic barrier or law that tri to keep them from do this this is especi true when a hacker want to fix someth that from his point of view is broken or need improv imperfect system infuri hacker whose primal instinct is to debug them this is one reason whi hacker general hate drive carsth system of random program red light and odd laid out one way street caus delay which are so goddamn unnecessari that the impuls is to rearrang sign open up traffic light control box redesign the entir system in a perfect hacker world anyon piss off enough to open up a control box near a traffic light and take it apart to make it work better should be perfect welcom to make the attempt rule which prevent you from take matter like that into your own hand are too ridicul to even consid abid by this attitud help the model railroad club start on an extrem inform basi someth call the midnight requisit committe when tmrc need a set of diod or some extra relay to build some new featur into the system a few sandp peopl would wait until dark and find their way into the place where those thing were kept none of the hacker who were as a rule scrupul honest in other matter seem to equat this with steal a will blind all inform should be free if you dont have access to the inform you need to improv thing how can you fix them a free exchang of inform particular when the inform was in the form of a comput program allow for greater overal creativ when you were work on a machin like the tx 0 which came with almost no softwar everyon would furious write system program to make program easiertool to make tool kept in the drawer by the consol for easi access by anyon use the machin this prevent the dread time wast ritual of reinvent the wheel instead of everybodi write his own version of the same program the best version would be avail to everyon and everyon would be free to delv into the code and improv on that a world stud with featur full program bum to the minimum debug to perfect the belief sometim taken uncondit that inform should be free was a direct tribut to the way a splendid comput or comput program worksth binari bit move in the most straightforward logic path necessari to do their complex job what was a comput but someth which benefit from a free flow of inform if say the accumul found itself unabl to get inform from the input/output i/o devic like the tape reader or the switch the whole system would collaps in the hacker viewpoint ani system could benefit from that easi flow of inform mistrust authoritypromot decentr the best way to promot this free exchang of inform is to have an open system someth which present no boundari between a hacker and a piec of inform or an item of equip that he need in his quest for knowledg improv and time on line the last thing you need is a bureaucraci bureaucraci whether corpor govern or univers are flaw system danger in that they cannot accommod the exploratori impuls of true hacker bureaucrat hide behind arbitrari rule as oppos to the logic algorithm by which machin and comput program oper they invok those rule to consolid power and perceiv the construct impuls of hacker as a threat the epitom of the bureaucrat world was to be found at a veri larg compani call intern busi machinesibm the reason it comput were batch process hulk giant was onli partial becaus of vacuum tube technolog the real reason was that ibm was a clumsi hulk compani which did not understand the hack impuls if ibm had it way so the tmrc hacker thought the world would be batch process laid out on those annoy littl punch card and onli the most privileg of priest would be permit to actual interact with the comput all you had to do was look at someon in the ibm world and note the button down white shirt the neat pin black tie the hair care held in place and the tray of punch card in hand you could wander into the comput center where the 704 the 709 and later the 7090 were storedth best ibm had to offerand see the stifl orderli down to the rope off area beyond which non author peopl could not ventur and you could compar that to the extrem inform atmospher around the tx 0 where grungi cloth were the norm and almost anyon could wander in now ibm had done and would continu to do mani thing to advanc comput by it sheer size and mighti influenc it had made comput a perman part of life in america to mani peopl the word ibm and comput were virtual synonym ibm machin were reliabl workhors worthi of the trust that businessmen and scientist invest in them this was due in part to ibm conserv approach it would not make the most technolog advanc machin but would reli on proven concept and care aggress market as ibm domin of the comput field was establish the compani becam an empir unto itself secret and smug what realli drove the hacker crazi was the attitud of the ibm priest and sub priest who seem to think that ibm had the onli real comput and the rest were all trash you couldnt talk to those peoplethey were beyond convinc they were batch process peopl and it show not onli in their prefer of machin but in their idea about the way a comput center and a world should be run those peopl could never understand the obvious superior of a decentr system with no one give order a system where peopl could follow their interest and if along the way they discov a flaw in the system they could embark on ambiti surgeri no need to get a requisit form just a need to get someth done this antibureaucrat bent coincid neat with the person of mani of the hacker who sinc childhood had grown accustom to build scienc project while the rest of their classmat were bang their head togeth and learn social skill on the field of sport these young adult who were onc outcast found the comput a fantast equal experienc a feel accord to peter samson like you open the door and walk through this grand new univers onc they pass through that door and sat behind the consol of a million dollar comput hacker had power so it was natur to distrust ani forc which might tri to limit the extent of that power hacker should be judg by their hack not bogus criteria such as degre age race or posit the readi accept of twelv year old peter deutsch in the tx 0 communiti though not by non hacker graduat student was a good exampl likewis peopl who trot in with seem impress credenti were not taken serious until they prove themselv at the consol of a comput this meritocrat trait was not necessarili root in the inher good of hacker heartsit was main that hacker care less about someon superfici characterist than they did about his potenti to advanc the general state of hack to creat new program to admir to talk about that new featur in the system you can creat art and beauti on a comput samson music program was an exampl but to hacker the art of the program did not resid in the pleas sound eman from the on line speaker the code of the program held a beauti of it own samson though was particular obscur in refus to add comment to his sourc code explain what he was do at a given time one well distribut program samson wrote went on for hundr of assembl languag instruct with onli one comment besid an instruct which contain the number 1750 the comment was ripjsb and peopl rack their brain about it mean until someon figur out that 1750 was the year bach die and that samson had written an abbrevi for rest in peac johann sebastian bach a certain esthet of program style had emerg becaus of the limit memori space of the tx 0 a handicap that extend to all comput of that era hacker came to deepli appreci innov techniqu which allow program to do complic task with veri few instruct the shorter a program was the more space you had left for other program and the faster a program ran sometim when you didnt need speed or space much and you werent think about art and beauti youd hack togeth an ugli program attack the problem with brute forc method well we can do this by ad twenti number samson might say to himself and it quicker to write instruct to do that than to think out a loop in the begin and the end to do the same job in seven or eight instruct but the latter program might be admir by fellow hacker and some program were bum to the fewest line so art that the author peer would look at it and almost melt with awe sometim program bum becam competit a macho contest to prove oneself so much in command of the system that one could recogn eleg shortcut to shave off an instruct or two or better yet rethink the whole problem and devis a new algorithm which would save a whole block of instruct an algorithm is a specif procedur which one can appli to solv a complex comput problem it is sort of a mathemat skeleton key this could most emphat be done by approach the problem from an offbeat angl that no one had ever thought of befor but that in retrospect made total sens there was definit an artist impuls resid in those who could util this genius from mar techniqu black magic visionari qualiti which enabl them to discard the stale outlook of the best mind on earth and come up with a total unexpect new algorithm this happen with the decim print routin program this was a subroutin program within a program that you could sometim integr into mani differ programsto translat binari number that the comput gave you into regular decim number in saunder word this problem becam the pawn ass of programmingif you could write a decim print routin which work you knew enough about the comput to call yourself a programm of sort and if you wrote a great decim print routin you might be abl to call yourself a hacker more than a competit the ultim bum of the decim print routin becam a sort of hacker holi grail various version of decim print routin had been around for some month if you were be deliber stupid about it or if you were a genuin moronan out and out loserit might take you a hundr instruct to get the comput to convert machin languag to decim but ani hacker worth his salt could do it in less and final by take the best of the program bum an instruct here and there the routin was diminish to about fifti instruct after that thing got serious peopl would work for hour seek a way to do the same thing in fewer line of code it becam more than a competit it was a quest for all the effort expend no one seem to be abl to crack the fifti line barrier the question aros whether it was even possibl to do it in less was there a point beyond which a program could not be bum among the peopl puzzl with this dilemma was a fellow name jenson a tall silent hacker from main who would sit quiet in the kluge room and scribbl on printout with the calm demeanor of a backwoodsman whittl jenson was alway look for way to compress his program in time and spacehi code was a complet bizarr sequenc of intermingl boolean and arithmet function often caus sever differ comput to occur in differ section of the same eighteen bit word amaz thing magic stunt befor jenson there had been general agreement that the onli logic algorithm for a decim print routin would have the machin repeat subtract use a tabl of the power of ten to keep the number in proper digit column jenson somehow figur that a power of ten tabl wasnt necessari he came up with an algorithm that was abl to convert the digit in a revers order but by some digit sleight of hand print them out in the proper order there was a complex mathemat justif to it that was clear to the other hacker onli when they saw jenson program post on a bulletin board his way of tell them that he had taken the decim print routin to it limit forti six instruct peopl would stare at the code and their jaw would drop marg saunder rememb the hacker be unusu quiet for day afterward we knew that was the end of it bob saunder later said that was nirvana comput can chang your life for the better this belief was subt manifest rare would a hacker tri to impos a view of the myriad advantag of the comput way of knowledg to an outsid yet this premis domin the everyday behavior of the tx 0 hacker as well as the generat of hacker that came after them sure the comput had chang their live enrich their live given their live focus made their live adventur it had made them master of a certain slice of fate peter samson later said we did it twenti five to thirti percent for the sake of do it becaus it was someth we could do and do well and sixti percent for the sake of have someth which was in it metaphor way aliv our offspr which would do thing on it own when we were finish that the great thing about program the magic appeal it has onc you fix a behavior problem a comput or program has it fix forev and it is exact an imag of what you meant like aladdin lamp you could get it to do your bid sure everyon could benefit from experienc this power sure everyon could benefit from a world base on the hacker ethic this was the implicit belief of the hacker and the hacker irrever extend the convent point of view of what comput could and should dolead the world to a new way of look and interact with comput this was not easili done even at such an advanc institut as mit some professor consid a manic affin for comput as frivol even dement tmrc hacker bob wagner onc had to explain to an engin professor what a comput was wagner experienc this clash of comput versus anti comput even more vivid when he took a numer analysi class in which the professor requir each student to do homework use rattl clunki electromechan calcul kotok was in the same class and both of them were appal at the prospect of work with those lo tech machin whi should we they ask when weve got this comput so wagner began work on a comput program that would emul the behavior of a calcul the idea was outrag to some it was a misappropri of valuabl machin time accord to the standard think on comput their time was too precious that one should onli attempt thing which took maximum advantag of the comput thing that otherwis would take room of mathematician day of mindless calcul hacker felt otherwis anyth that seem interest or fun was fodder for computingand use interact comput with no one look over your shoulder and demand clearanc for your specif project you could act on that belief after two or three month of tangl with intricaci of float point arithmet necessari to allow the program to know where to place the decim point on a machin that had no simpl method to perform elementari multipl wagner had written three thousand line of code that did the job he had made a ridicul expens comput perform the function of a calcul that cost a thousand time less to honor this ironi he call the program expens desk calcul and proud did the homework for his class on it his gradezero you use a comput the professor told him this cant be right wagner didnt even bother to explain how could he convey to his teacher that the comput was make realiti out of what were onc incred possibl or that anoth hacker had even written a program call expens typewrit that convert the tx 0 to someth you could write text on could process your write in string of charact and print it out on the flexowritercould you imagin a professor accept a classwork report written by the comput how could that professorhow could in fact anyon who hadnt been immers in this unchart man machin universeunderstand how wagner and his fellow hacker were routin use the comput to simul accord to wagner strang situat which one could scarc envis otherwis the professor would learn in time as would everyon that the world open up by the comput was a limitless one if anyon need further proof you could cite the project that kotok was work on in the comput center the chess program that beard al professor uncl john mccarthi as he was becom known to his hacker student had begun on the ibm 704 even though kotok and the sever other hacker help him on the program had onli contempt for the ibm batch process mental that pervad the machin and the peopl around it they had manag to scroung some late night time to use it interact and had been engag in an inform battl with the system programm on the 704 to see which group would be known as the biggest consum of comput time the lead would bounc back and forth and the white shirt and black tie 704 peopl were impress enough to actual let kotok and his group touch the button and switch on the 704 rare sensual contact with a vaunt ibm beast kotok role in bring the chess program to life was indic of what was to becom the hacker role in artifici intellig a heavi head like mccarthi or like his colleagu marvin minski would begin a project or wonder aloud whether someth might be possibl and the hacker if it interest them would set about do it the chess program had been start use fortran one of the earli comput languag comput languag look more like english than assembl languag are easier to write with and do more thing with fewer instruct howev each time an instruct is given in a comput languag like fortran the comput must first translat that command into it own binari languag a program call a compil doe this and the compil take up time to do it job as well as occupi valuabl space within the comput in effect use a comput languag put you an extra step away from direct contact with the comput and hacker general prefer assembl or as they call it machin languag to less eleg higher level languag like fortran kotok though recogn that becaus of the huge amount of number that would have to be crunch in a chess program part of the program would have to be done in fortran and part in assembl they hack it part by part with move generat basic data structur and all kind of innov algorithm for strategi after feed the machin the rule for move each piec they gave it some paramet by which to evalu it posit consid various move and make the move which would advanc it to the most advantag situat kotok kept at it for year the program grow as mit kept upgrad it ibm comput and one memor night a few hacker gather to see the program make some of it first move in a real game it open was quit respect but after eight or so exchang there was real troubl with the comput about to be checkmat everybodi wonder how the comput would react it too a while everyon knew that dure those paus the comput was actual think if your idea of think includ mechan consid various move evalu them reject most and use a predefin set of paramet to ultim make a choic final the comput move a pawn two squar forwardilleg jump over anoth piec a bug but a clever oneit got the comput out of check mayb the program was figur out some new algorithm with which to conquer chess at other univers professor were make public proclam that comput would never be abl to beat a human be in chess hacker knew better they would be the one who would guid comput to greater height than anyon expect and the hacker by fruit meaning associ with the comput would be foremost among the beneficiari but they would not be the onli beneficiari everyon could gain someth by the use of think comput in an intellectu autom world and wouldnt everyon benefit even more by approach the world with the same inquisit intens skeptic toward bureaucraci open to creativ unselfish in share accomplish urg to make improv and desir to build as those who follow the hacker ethic by accept other on the same unprejud basi by which comput accept anyon who enter code into a flexowrit wouldnt we benefit if we learn from comput the mean of creat a perfect system if everyon could interact with comput with the same innoc product creativ impuls that hacker did the hacker ethic might spread through societi like a benevol rippl and comput would inde chang the world for the better in the monast confin of the massachusett institut of technolog peopl had the freedom to live out this dreamth hacker dream no one dare suggest that the dream might spread instead peopl set about build right there at mit a hacker xanadu the like of which might never be duplic hacker hero of the comput revolut by steven levi c1984
