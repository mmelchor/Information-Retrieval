began earnest i shall esteem it a favour not for the world my dear vicomt money is the one anxieti which seldom caus me a second thought my habit of life is simpl and my onli ambit my profess but to go back to the happi chanc of our meet may i inquir without indiscret the name of the young ladi whom you rescu oh come come honour where honour is due i am no more respons for the rescu than yourself the young ladi is a miss grey live with her aunt in temporari lodg in essex street off the strand i have a suspicion sir that the name may be as temporari as her lodg and that i am fortun in appli to one who can give me reliabl inform to this howev the vicomt onli bow somewhat stiffli and be unwil that ani contretemp should aris to mar so promis an acquaintancethough the lord onli know what umbrag ani one could take from my remarki made my adieux the vicomt most oblig offer me his servic should i wish to pass over to franc but of these i could not as yet avail myself as it was necessari i should know of ladi jane intent more definit so with my acknowledg the interview end chapter ii i discov a new interest in life on my way back to soho i turn over matter with interest i had but littl difficulti in place the vicomt he was one of those clear simpl soul veri charm at time in woman but less accept in the man of the world no one can admir puriti of mind in a woman more than myself but i have no hesit in state that at time i find it posit disconcert when display in too obvious a degre by a man in woman it is to be desir abov all thing and woman is so far superior to man in the manipul of the more delic qualiti that she seldom err in her conceal and when she reveal she doe so at the most opportun moment and so effect that though it be no more than a glimps it suffic and these reflect brought me natur to miss grey inde in fanci i had never been away from her sinc we met the vicomt manner absolut confirm me in my belief that the name was assum now if a man doe not wish to tell you the truth and the occas be import he has just one of two altern the one is to tell a lie with such assur and bear that it carri convict with it but egad if he wont do that then the onli other is to run you through the vicomt not have been readi for either i was so far in his confid that i knew miss grey was an assum name and i shrewd suspect from the familiar of her manner with him that their mutual relat might be closer than he care to admita suspicion i resolv to put to the touch accord the next day i made as care a toilet as my curs disguis would admit of and took my way to essex street give my name to the man at the door for the lodg were genteel beyond the ordinari which advanc me in my surmis as to the fair one condit i was usher into a draw room which would have been much better for a littl more light than was permit to enter through the drawn curtain in a few moment the door open and an elder ladi enter whom i conjectur to be the aunt madam i said bow low it was my good fortun to be of some slight servic to your niec yesterday and i have ventur to call and inquir if the shock has prove at all serious my name madam is tut tut boy none of your air and grace with me your name is hughi maxwel and mani the time ive skelp you into good manner come here and kiss your old cousin you scamp and without wait for me to compli with her invit she threw her arm about me and discompos me sad enough with an unexpect outburst of weep when she had recov somewhat we settl down to explan question from her and answer from me until at length she was satisfi on all my movement then came my turn and i began with a definit object in view but care guard my advanc when she cut my finess short now hughi stop your fiddl faddl and ask me who my niec is you stupid blockhead dont you know your curios is peek out at everi corner of your eye my niec is margaret nairn a relat of lord nairn no one would count her so save a highland they are from the far north not the perth peopl but dont interrupt her mother and i were school mate and friend somewhat more than a hundr year ago i have had the girl with me in edinburgh and pari and when i found she was doom to be buri aliv with her father in their lone old hous in the highland and neither woman nor protector about i took her the child of my oldest friend to my care and at no time have i been more thank than now when the whole countri is set by the ear we are in london masquerad as mistress grey and her niec as her onli brother archi an offic in the french servic is mix up in this unfortun affair and it is probabl onli a matter of time until he get into troubl and will need everi effort i may be abl to put forth in his behalf no you have not come across him for he was on some secret mission and it is possibl he may not have set foot in scotland at all we can but wait and see now that your curios is satisfi doubtless you are long to see the young ladi herself but let me warn you master hughi i will have none of your philand margaret is as dear to me as if she were my own daughter born and i may as well tell you at onc i have plan for her futur with which i will brook no interfer may i ask cousin

futur intent a pang my cousin was a woman and as such was privileg to chang her mind as often as she chose and i was still young enough not to be worri by the thought that some day i might not be the one call upon to step into her comfort shoe as for the vicomt he must play for his own hand so i await with impati the appear of my fair supplant she was much younger than i had suppos not more than sixteen but if i had been mistaken in her age i had not over estim her beauti her hair was realli the same rich amber colour that had awaken my admir her forehead was broad and low her eye between hazel and gray with clear well mark brow her nose straight and regular and her mouth though not small was beauti shape with the least droop at the corner which made her express winsom in the extrem her face was a littl angular as yet but the line were good and her slight point chin was broken by the merest shadow of a dimpl she was taller than most women and if her figur had not round out to it full proport her bear was nobl and her carriag grace difficult as it is for me to give even this cold inventori of her charm the sweet witcheri of her manner the fall of her voic the win grace that

with a composur i fain would have assum myself but it was imposs the supper at ladi jane was gay enough even the vicomt contribut his modicum of entertain no doubt stimul thereto by the thought of my near departur and sure when a man may give pleasur by his go as well as by his come he is in a posit to be envi i sang jacobit song that even with an express that would have carri convict to the duke of cumberland himself and when i took my departur with the vicomt after midnight i left a verit hot bed of sedit behind my companion though outward civil took my littl pleasantri with so ill a grace that i was in a measur prepar for his word at our part befor the coach offic chevali you are a man of mani charm part i trust you will long be spare to exercis them in quarter where they may fail to

so radic a reason for keep the peac between us with these thought and other german to them i while away the time until the coach was readi and at the dead hour of two in the morn we roll out of london on our way to huntingdon where we arriv at eight the follow even i put up at the bell which was comfort enough and made shift to employ my time through the long week befor me in some manner that would

fontenoy or make a leg at mar i doubt it nor is it strang that a man with no more vaniti than myself should find some littl vexat at the pervers of ladi jane in fasten this ridicul upon me that it was intent i could not doubt from her letter for she ralli me upon it at everi turn she could drag in howev i had the consol that i was to join her forthwith at harwich and my journey across the countri over bad road with a pair of wretch nag gave me more materi discomfort to rail at and by these mean i brought myself to a frame of mind that i could at least imagin ladi jane enjoy of her childish jest when i reach newmarket i found to my disgust it was imposs to go forward again that night but was on the road bright and earli the next morn howev it was even befor i was set down at a decent

befor half an hour is over ill pink the soul out of you oh lord sir have a care what you do he shriek in terror and befor i could intercept him he had thrown open the door into the adjoin room where three offic sat at their wine befor the fire captain galway your honour i am undon for uphold the law save me save me damn you for a whine hound what do you mean by rush in like this roar the offic address who i mark wore a naval uniform dure the babel of explan which follow from the terrifi creatur i was by no mean easi in my mind for i could not but think the frigat was station there for a

trudg toward the town i found the inn where ladi jane and margaret lodg without difficulti and on my inquiri for them the land lord said if you are the servant my ladi has been expect let me tell you you have been within an ace of lose your place for you are a day late and but for the wind she would have sail this morn you are to go to your room at onc and then you wait on her and i for one dont envi you your recept take your thing and come this way the thought of be so near friend banish ani petti annoy i might have felt at this treatment inde i could but so admir ladi jane clever that i enter into the jest and inquir what manner of person my new mistress might be master master tis a god merci she was not born a man or it might have been ill hold with her the honest creatur return with much decis and i at onc place him as a man of fair judgment in my room i found the suit of bottl green liveri ladi jane had promis laid out for me so i soon made my transform complet and present myself at the door my guid had point out my cousin voic in answer to my discreet signal on the panel bade me enter and my welcom was a merri one how i made them laugh over my appear with what satisfact did i turn the tabl on ladi jane by the landlord estim of her charact when she attempt to resum her quizz over mr simpkin but it was when i came to the relat of my adventur with captain galway that i met a verit triumph to ladi jane it afford a new mark for her wit and she profess to be vast amus at my groundless alarm but to margaret who was much distress by ladi jane leviti twas all tragedi of the most serious descript illustr how i made them laugh over my appear the measur taken for her brother safeti had prove entir effectu and it was clear that margaret credit me sole with his releas which was now assur though i honest believ the duke signatur would have been onli so much worthless paper had i not suggest the vicomt servic be this as it may i did not hold i was bound to combat with her sens of gratitud for heaven know i have so often suffer under an over suffici of undeserv censur that a littl overflow of approb was most welcom we hope to be off earli the next morn but ala on our awaken the wind was as unfavour as befor and there were no sign of a chang it was an anxious day for all of us it was clear enough the duke of newcastl had suspect me and though it was possibl he did not realis my import it was quit probabl he would have ladi jane follow close watch for the presenc of captain fitzgerald as he chose to style me the proxim of the triumphant and her over hospit command with his pri friend mr hargreav was never out of my mind and it was with no small uneasi i learn the governor of the town had been unceas in his attent to the two ladi true this may have meant noth but pure civil but the purest civil may prove as embarrass as the commonest intrus when one has anyth to conceal confound the man he press his ill time courtesi upon us twenti time a day and i could not but grow apprehens when i mark the scarc conceal curios with which he regard me had i been a slave in a barracoon my point could not have been gone over more care and had i been both deaf and dumb my qualiti could not have been discuss with more open never befor had i realis that even a lackey might resent hear himself discuss like an anim at a fair and ladi jane took a pervers delight in provok the governor critiqu when i was within earshot our morn walk in his garden will serv as an ensampl has your fellow ani experi of travel the governor would ask stop in his walk and eye me as if he were at a court martial or is he as useless as the rest of his kind ive no doubt hell prove stupid enough when we get where we realli need him she would answer coolli bend over some favourit flower tis realli shame the lie recommend one friend give servant nowaday he look stupid enough to prove honest growl the governor but if he were put through a few week drill with my sergeant cane behind those fat calv of his twould smarten him up a bit what love gueldr rose exclaim margaret enthusiast and straightway fell to prais one flower after anoth with such rapid and success that even ladi jane ingenu could find no opportun to lead the governor back to the tortur again howev i had my reveng for ladi jane herself was unpleas startl that same day as we sate at dinner in our room and the governor chose to pay us anoth visit without warn there was a frantic scurri for a few moment as we remov all trace of my place and his excel must have had a suspici train of thought run through his head as he wait for me to unlock the door this i did with unmov counten and ladi jane made the excus of be somewhat en deshabill as the room was over warm with the fire and it pass without further remark though i could see he eye me from time to time as i stood behind her chair i wait on them i flatter myself quit as perfect as the most high train servantfor the tabl is a point to which i have alway devot much attent and my knowledg stood me in good stead now whatev his suspicion were he did not dare to make them known ladi jane was a person of too recognis a posit not to make it high inconveni for ani one who might interfer with her without due justif and the next day we sail without hinder upon our arriv at the hagu the first letter we receiv was one from the vicomt to margaret assur her of her brother safeti and inform her it was common report in london that princ charl had escap to the contin in the train of ladi jane drummond so we knew to a certainti the governor had mistaken me for the princ and inform the court of his suspicion whether the mistak was flatter to me or not i cannot fair judg so far as the princ stood moral or intellectu he was beneath my contempt but physic my impress is that he was handsomeat least he had a fine carriag and bear it is most difficult to judg ani man in his posit all my train and educ and that of my ancestor for generat befor me had been such that i have scarc been abl to look on a king save with a feel close akin to rever so with these reserv i allow the dubious compliment to pass but whatev i might think there was no doubt but the circumst had rais me mani degre in margaret estim and this also i owe to the unwit servic of the vicomt who had success help me on to near everi advanc in her affect from the hagu we journey by easi stage to pari where ladi jane found suitabl lodg for herself and margaret in the rue dauphin while i found a humbl one better fit to my purs in the rue du petit bourbon i at onc made applic to join my old regiment but to my chagrin i was onli put off from month to month and insist on an answer i was curt inform there was no captainci vacant and i must remain satisfi with the small pension the king was pleas to give me as offic in the scottish expedit or accept a subaltern posit when the vicomt arriv by the end of may he resum his posit in the royal guard and his even visit to ladi jane or rather to margaret about the middl of the summer he succeed in obtain an authent copi of the act of indemn which was studi with the greatest interest by us all the

fit introduct to my place of banishmentlouisbourg a pretenti and cost fortif but miser situat and fall to decay for want of the most necessari repair there it was shut in on the one hand by the monoton sea wild and threaten with it ice and snow and storm in winter sad and depress with it mourn fog in summerand on the other by an unbroken wilder of rock and firsthat i ate out my heart in bitter year after year my onli allevi be the rare letter which i receiv from margaret but which i scarc could answer though my retic onli brought forth a fuller express of the unwav affect of her generous soul dear as this indulg in a cherish affect was to me i brought myself to renounc it for i held i was bound to this for more than one reason now that i had entir broken with my past i recognis that perhap i should have done so sooner was it not folli to suppos that a girl such as margaret would not follow her generous fanci when propinqu was ad to inclin ala that such admir decis are onli so readili consent to when the occas for delinqu is no longer possibl then too my posit toward ladi jane was a delic one she had clear indic to me her intent as to the dispos of her fortun a hope or even a content correspond was imposs to one in my situat and to enter into ani truth detail of the miseri of my surround might well appear even in her kind judgment but an impli appeal to her generos for this it was that i gradual cut down my letter year by year until i entir ceas from all intercours and live my lone life as best i might for fellow exil i had near an hundr discont gentlemen rule over a homesick soldieri two or three unfortun gentlewomen a few greedi and dishonest offici and a hand of wretch townspeopl whose prosper was never foster in time of peac nor their safeti consid in time of war at last through the friendship of the comt de raimond governor of the island i obtain a tardi promot to the rank of lieuten in the regiment of artoi under m de st julhien and the appoint as king interpret on which i was heartili congratul by my comrad who had long piti my undeserv ill fortun until then i had made but littl effort to better my condit but my advanc as well as the increas in my pay arous me i took fresh heart in and my appear and began to mix somewhat in such societi as our forlorn situat afford in madam de drucour wife of our command i found a grand dame de par le mond who command the admir and respect of all our offic and the devot of the soldieri and townspeopl in madam prevost the most charm littl canadian wife of the commissarya creatur with the carriag of a lackey and the soul of a dri salteri discov a heart full of tender sympathi die of ennui her husband unpopular was such that but few of the offic would enter his door and inde he was so fierc a cerberus in regard to his unfortun wife that he made ani attempt at allevi of her unhappi condit wellnigh imposs howev through my acquaint with a m de sarenn a canadian partisan offic who stood high in his favour he saw fit to allow my visit and i will put up with his want of breed to offer such attent as i might to his prison for so in truth she was sarenn was attract enough in so far as his outward appear went but like most of his countrymenthat is the canadianswa want in all those extern which are essenti to a gentleman he was courag but a braggart he was well born but had no breed he was open and friend but i fear trucul and his sens of honour was not abov the univers dishonesti which disgrac and wreck his unfortun countri i had suspect his intimaci with prevost had some less honour foundat than a piti admir for his unfortun wife and i was confirm in this by his propos in my quarter one even that i should hand over to him some blank sign by st julhien on the commissari for store etc which i was to requisit as requir may i ask to what use you intend to put them i said more to sound him than for inform for this was one of the most favour form of pecul in the coloni oh none that you will ever know of chevali and i should think an addit to your inadequ pay would not come amiss he ad art without even an effort to veil his knaveri the whole disgrac pettifog scheme disgust me but becaus he was a much younger man than i and i believ might be in prevost power i refrain from my natur indign and pass over the person affront i spake to him with all the consider of a friend i shew him the path which he was tread and point out the inevit disgrac which must attend such a cours and most of all the wretch mean of so contempt a crime but to my astonish he was inclin to excus and cloak his wrong do sir said i noth is further from my like than an artifici moral but i would avoid even the appear of be cheapli vicious do not weigh out the largest possibl measur of dishonesti to the smallest possibl quantum of correct if you must depart from that path of virtu toward which we should all direct our best endeavour do so in a manner that will at least command the admir of gentlemen and the lenienc of a divin be who may consid the frailti of the natur man but never the tortuous conclus of his compromis intellect he was appar sensibl of my kind advic but i soon discov that he not onli disregard it but was endeavour to do me an ill turn with the commissari by direct his warp and jealous suspicion toward my innoc attent to his wife the

english lad should be allow to share my quarter with me i set my servant to work arrang for his comfort and we sate in my littl garden i die with curios to hear what lucki chanc had blown him hither where is your mother kit i ask at this his eye fill and his lip trembl and for some moment he could not repli dure which i was unabl to suppress a selfish hope that perchanc my time of probat had end mother is lost he answer at last but let me start fair i was pleas to mark the boy spake with an easi address for i hate the taint of servil abov all thing ever sinc i had grown up i have been beg her to let me get to sea and at length she yield in part to my entreati and in part to the wish of some member of the societi who had settl in boston in the provinc of massachusett and agre to come out to them for me anyth answer that would give me my wish and i did not see that it matter whether she was among methodist in england or among methodist in america you are right my lad i imagin they would make the world much of a like wherev they might be he answer noth to my observ but went on at length all our prepar were complet and we left in june last in a wretch old craft call the african chief so ill found that she was dismast and disabl in the first gale we met with we were captur or rather rescu three day later by this veri ship i have just come in and the hulk was rerig and sent back to franc a prize with her unfortun crew and passeng as prison from this fate my mother and i were preserv through the kind of a french ladi who took compass on mother as the onli woman on board and offer to take her as her wait woman and i was allow to accompani her anyth was better than the certainti of a prison in franc what was the ladi name kit i may know her pon my word sir i am asham to say i dont know myself there were no other of her condit on board and she was address by everi one simpli as madam and i never thought of ask my mother never mind go on we were treat with everi kind and madam show everi conceiv consider for my poor mother while i made friend with all on board and soon learn enough french to find my way about ship madam and my poor mother found the length of the voyag tedious to a degre but i love everi hour of it we unfortun ran short of water as our cask had so strain dure a heavi gale we encount they lost all or most of their content besid this mischief the gale drove us so far out of our cours to the north that our captain determin to run into the baie des chaleur for a fresh suppli of water this we did and there found it in abund and after the boat had begun to pass backward and forward and we were convinc there was no danger madam and mother were allow to have their wish and leav the ship for a rambl on shore at first they stay within sight but gradual gain courag they stray away unnot by ani of us for some time when they were miss an instant search was made and we start through the wood halloo and fire our piec but without result at length some of the sailor who had been in those part befor discov a place where they said indian had late camp we soon found further trace that confirm this and at last a small gray tippet which i knew to be mother and we were no longer in doubt i was wild to keep at the search but the other persuad me it was useless to do so that these savag wander over the whole countri and would certain carri their prison to some post where they would claim a reward especi if they thought they were english which might well be the case and in ani event there was no danger of their live as these savag never illtreat white women except in attack anxious as i was i could not but agre that they were right and so said no more but now i am content to remain here as i have a better chanc of hear news than if exchang for some french prison as we were hope all the way out although i had not the same confid as the boy i encourag him in his hope and in turn told him of my own do sinc i had left their roof in london my whole exist now took on a differ aspect my duti were in no degre oner and kit the dear boy so won everi heart that he was look upon as a guest of the whole garrison rather than a prison no restrict were place upon his movement and we roam over the whole countri with our fowl piec or angl and mani a fine string of trout did we present to madam de drucour and other friend we explor the countri from louisbourg to mire and there we fell in with sarenn and his follow with whom kit was delight beyond measur and inde there was much in the canadian to attract those who did not look beyond the extern he fair enchant the boy with his tale of savag life his exhibit of his wild follow and his skill in woodcraft and the chase and i soon felt that kit was revolv some plan for discov the whereabout of his mother through his aid this was the one flaw in my happi if i had not wish for her death i had at least hope never to hear of her again and inde there seem but littl likelihood of it in this remot quarter but everi inquiri on the part of kit gave me fresh uneasi this he was quick to perceiv but as i had never given him an inkl of the reason he put my hold to him down to the like of a solitari exil for one of his own kind sarenn too saw my fond for the lad and took a pleasur in attract him from me on everi possibl excus but it was not until a dinner given by m de drucour at the new year that i saw how far his petti cruelti could go with an air of assum genial he said to the command m de drucour befor i start on my expedit to morrow i am tempt to ask for a volunt in the english lad christoph he is anxious to go and i shall be pleas to have him but monsieur you can hard have him without me for i am respons to m de drucour for his safe keep i broke in with a chill fear at my heart that my one treasur in the world would be imperil in such treacher hand m de maxwel seem over fond of this prison sneer m prevost who was an unwelcom guest but could not well be left out on an offici occas a too lenient jailer may be even more danger than his prison at time he went on and i saw that further discuss might onli precipit matter when i stood in so delic a posit for a

of applaus as to frenchmen in particular i have known some who were so danger with the pen that i would inde hesit to trust them with the sword now as prevost was hate and dread for noth more than his lie report to the minist at home and as no man in ani posit at the tabl had escap his venom my salli was again greet not onli with applaus but also with a roar of stentorian laughter the whole affair end in noth more serious than the hot word and laughter for sarenn though a braggart was not evil temper at least toward me for prevost i care not a maravedi and would have spit him like a smoke

jean missionari to the indian though the priest spake with confid i judg he had no small difficulti in persuad the savag to part with us for there was much discuss and appar grumbl on the part of the chief but at length the obstacl whatev it was was overcom and the priest announc we were free to depart my cano is small for four peopl and would be too heavi when we begin the ascent of the

need have no fear andr is to be trust in all thing these matter be settl we were made spectat to sure the strangest sight my eye had ever look upon andr brought forth a small fold tabl and the priest still in his rusti soutan recit the holi offic of the mass to the kneel savag under the shade of the great pine and onli the rippl of the water broke the paus in the servic to my astonish the indian recit the venit but this was the extent of their knowledg apart from the pater noster the confiteor and some of the respons illustr the priest recit the holi offic of the mass when the servic was end we breakfast heartili and as soon as the priest prepar were made we embark with oh such differ heart from yesterday now that our anxieti was at rest i had time to observ the priest more close though his figur was slight it move to the dip of his paddl like that of a man vigor in all exercis his long thin hand were full of strength and his face though worn and burn to almost as dark a colour as that of an indian was that of a man who must have been handsom in his youth at his age i could not even guess beyond that he look old with his scanti beard and long white hair which fell almost to his shoulder we sat face to face as he paddl in the stern of the cano and i marvel at the wild grandeur of the river and forest which i had bare mark befor it is beautifuly veri beauti he said present

as he spake befor we part for the night i ask by what name we might address him le pere jean he answer that is not difficult to rememb i said smile which is import my daughter for it has to serv me from gasp to michilimacinac there is but littl danger of confus in the name of missionari he ad sad the labour are few when we left him i was glad to find that even luci strict view were not proof against his simpl good i had fear the veri fact of his priest offic would have prejud her for i knew her sect made littl of much the older religion held sacr but in speak of him afterward she simpli said the lord is wiser than we he know what vessel to choos for his servic we were so tire and there was such a sens of secur in our new keep that we were asleep befor we knew but dure the night i fell into a strang dream which so distress me that i awok with tear stream down my face what it was i could not clear gather but with the awaken came my sorrow afresh and i lay stare up into the black with wide open eye present i heard luci soft whisper dear heart what is the matter luci whi are you awak christoph she answer i know my boy is in sore troubl on my account and ala he has not my faith to support him luci i whisper after a paus i have been selfish in my own troubl i have not rememb your whi should you mistress she said simpli you have been good to me beyond what one in my condit has

suffer a common sorrow in our sever from those most dear to us and i long to take her in my arm and tell her all my pain had she been a mere servant i might have done so if onli for the comfort of cri togeth but she was too near my own class and yet not quit of it to permit me to take this solac so we talk quiet for a space and then fell onc more to sleep chapter xiv i am direct into a new path the follow morn when we resum our quiet way in the cano le pere jean ask well my daughter did ani light come to you through the dark no my father but i have found a littl quiet that is much now i shall ask you to listen to me patient for i may say much with which you will not agre but you will trust me that i onli say that which i know to be best we have everi reason to believ a serious descent will be made on louisbourg in the spring so that apart from ani other reason your presenc in a town which will in all probabl suffer a bombard would be unwis and undesir in the last degre you have no idea of what war actual mean it is a horror that would haunt you to your die day but my father in that case i should at least be by his side that in itself would mean everyth to us both that is a point i had not intend to touch on my daughter i know the world i know that men banish to such exil as that in which m de maxwel has live chang much with the year think how you have chang yourself in happier surround than he has known think what new connect he may have form did you never think that he oh my father what would you tell me do you know m de maxwel i have never been in louisbourg he answer somewhat cold as if my earnest had hurt him but you do not mean that he may be marri he may be it would sure not be unnatur it might not in anoth man but in him it would be imposs he is not as other men may i inquir my daughter if he ever ask you in marriag no my father i told you how he was situat besid my guardian then wish me to marri anoth and you would not i did not i answer with some littl hauteur for i held this was besid the matter and a subject on which even he had no right to question me well that can make but littl differ now he said after a short paus what doe make the differ is that louisbourg is an imposs for you at the present your best cours is to go on to quebec i shall give you letter to m de montcalm who is so old and intim a friend that i may ask him ani favour he will see that you have passag in the first fit vessel for franc in order that you may not be subject to embarrass surmis i hold your best plan is to continu to style yourself mme de st just in fact that has now becom a necess onc in franc you can with the influenc at your commandfor i will see that m de montcalm further your desireprocur the recal of m de maxwel in the spring and so realis the dream which has now led you so far astray do not think i am blame you overmuch he ad quick you have been led astray becaus you could not see as the world see your heart and motiv were pure were generous but none the less are you subject to those rule which govern so rigor the class to which you belong whose veri exist depend on their observ in a romanc the world would no doubt have wept over your perplex but in real life it would crush you becaus you have sin against the onli code it acknowledg your puriti and faith would count for noth believ me my child i know it and it way so it was decid and at onc i began to plan with new hope for the desir of my heart and such was the chang it wrought in me that the whole world took on a new interest to my eye for the first time i realis the

like imprison wall with great sombr pine now open and radiant with the gold and scarlet of the mapl marshal in order by the white lanc of the slender birch at time luci and i were allow to walk along the reach of level sand to reliev the strain on the paddler where the river ran swift and strong and when we at length gain the great stretch of the lake call matapediac like the river my heart was full of the beauti and charm about me the span o life nae lang eneugh nor deep eneugh the sea nor braid eneugh this weari warld to part my love frae me i sang in my heart for was it not all so wonder so beyond all plan this way of love it might be long it might be weari but it would lead aright in the end when the head of the lake was reach the cano were lift from the water that of the strang

quebec at the meti the strang indian left us and return to join their fellow late one afternoon le pere jean ran the cano inshor and noth loath we left her in charg of andr to follow the priest up the high bank and take our way on foot under the great pine a low breez was move almost silent among the tree bring an unwont fresh we could verili tast soon we mark the screen of undergrowth which hid

be somewhat uncertain now as the english who winter at halifax are at sea again but there is time enough to decid the whole summer is befor us and all this without a word without a look of reproach how my heart went out to him for his forbear at length i ask the question which was alway with me mon pere is there ani news from louisbourg noth that is hope a more formid fleet than ever befor has left england we cannot expect ani succour from franc and louisbourg is probabl invest by this time if the enemi have made good their land befor anoth month the matter will be push to an issu and it will be against us unless the place can be reliev where the expect relief was to come from i did not dare to ask as i could not doubt but that m de sarenn was an import factor in the plan le pere jean had manifold duti to perform dure his short stay impati coupl were marri children were baptis and mani an anxious heart reliev of the burthen which it had born alon through the long imprison of the winter he did not suffer me to remain idl either for he gather the children about him and show me how to instruct them in the element of our faith here is your work he said smile you have your educ and sympathi on the one hand and on the other are these littl black and brown headsbergeron tremblay gauthier and so onto be fill with some measur of the grace which god intend for each of them it will be a comfort to me to think of them in your hand while i am sent on my master busi often into path not of my own choos do not on ani account be tempt to leav here until i come or send for you even if m de sarenn should appear be under no apprehens for all you need do is to tell mme dufour and it will be a delight to her to balk his plan as there is no love lost between these island and the peopl of the main land i will do my best mon pere when may i look for your return i cannot tell perhap in a month or so but do not let that disturb you for even if i am prevent i will sure send you word what to do seek your quiet in your daili task and your comfort in prayer so he took his way leav me in such content as was possibl had i dare i would have question him about the letter but i could not bring myself to acknowledg this humili even to him i felt it so keen that i no longer wonder my tormentor had felt himself free to make ani propos when it was but to one whom he believ to be the discard wife of anoth and i found a new miseri in vain imagin of what had been written to call forth so heartless a repli i would comfort myself at one moment by think it was not intend for me onli to be met by the altern of hugh be marri to anoth turn which way i might i could frame no explan which brought ani comfort if the letter were for me then had no man ever betray love more cruelli if for anoth then i had thrown away my life my work with the children was the greatest boon which could have been grant me it kept me sane and healthi and my heart went out to the littl ignor soul so full of life and affect it was no task it was a welcom labour of love and the children saw and felt it as such on their side their littl feet were never too weari nor their littl hand too tire to respond to ani servic i might ask of them but despit their love and the unfail kind of mme dufour it was imposs to escap from my pain my daili refug was the altar of the littl church where night and morn often in compani of some other lone woman anxious for the safeti of son or husband far at sea i laid bare my soul in an agoni of supplic for the safeti of the one dear to me abov all other and i found support too in the thought of the devot priest pursu his lone way consecr his life and effort for other most of whom made no return for they knew not the great of his sacrific the rumour that reach us dure the next two month brought no assuag to our fear and when le pere jean came toward the middl of august men women and children gather on the beach to welcom him his white worn face and weari bear told his messag befor he spake a word and my heart fail me at the sight with his unfail consider he turn to me the moment he saw my distress le chevali de maxwel is safe he escap the night the capitul was sign he whisper and then turn with his news toward the anxious peopl like one afar off i heard him tell of the long sieg of the hardship endur the courag display the surrend of the ruin fortress and the remov of the garrison to the ship of war but in the selfish of love my heart was too full of gratitud to have understand for aught els when the stori was end and the eager question answer he turn to me again and invit me to follow we took our way toward the church you are anxious to hear more he said gentl let me tell you all i know m de maxwel left the town onli after the capitul was reluct agre to by m de drucour who with all his offic had protest against it and would will have held out even beyond hope he ran the gantlet of the batteri the whole length of the harbour in safeti he was at miramichi onli two day befor i arriv there and took command of some canadian in charg of a number of english prison to lead them to quebec so you may comfort yourself with the thought of his safeti and that your prayer have been answer what will happen now mon pere that is imposs to say except that the english will certain push everi advantag they have gain and unless substanti help come from without the outlook is desper did no help come to louisbourg mon pere none he answer and the one word sank into my heart like a knell he part from me at the church door and i wander down to the beach alon the loss of louisbourg as even i could see might mean the loss of canada and in the priest eye at least it loss was due not so much to the weak of the garrison as to the failur of the relief and this relief could have come onli by the man who had withstood his command hold out a shame condit as the price of his obedi whether le pere jean was right or wrong i could not judg but i sure knew he could but lay the sourc of this dishonour to the wil act of the woman he had rescu and befriend in her hour of need the news of the gallant defenc of carillon went far to offset the disast of louisbourg but not to allay our anxieti and septemb was a tri month for us all but gabriel visit us twice and was unshaken in his confid time enough to cri out when we are beaten madam we have held them back at carillon and will do so again if need be they have been beaten in the upper countri befor this and they will be clever inde if they can come up the river they did so onc befor gabriel une foi nest pas coutum madam pilot cannot be pick up like peas i expect word from le pere jean everi day and await it with conflict feel i was most anxious to know the truth about hugh and yet to meet him was past my desir if he were realli marri should that prove the case then i would use my utmost effort to return to franc without his know i had ever been in the countri should he discov it then i must bear the humili as best i might but i could not bring myself to go away and perhap wreck my futur as well as his through a misunderstand i felt i had gone too far had suffer too much to throw it all away when the truth was within my reach in the begin of octob gabriel came with the expect letter from le pere jean mme de sarenn and angeliqu had gone on to quebec to spend the winter there and i was expect to join them whenev it might be conveni i took affection farewel of my good friend mme dufour and the infant popul of the parish and set forth with gabriel we made a grand run of it and were in full view of the town befor the sun had quit set i had seen no place except perhap edinburgh with which i could compar it and quebec gain in the comparison gabriel saw my admir and was delight look at it well madam it is the gate of the finest countri le bon dieu ever creat and we hold the key no man need have a faint heart when he can look on quebec see the littl fort there on the top of the cape it was made to signal a king ship onli see the chateau where it stand it look like the governor himself see the steepl of the cathedr of the jesuit of the recollet see the convent and the hospit it is like the holi citi of god and then talk if one can of it fall into the hand of les goddam and les bostonnai bah it is imposs if not what is the use of go to church on sunday truli he had everi excus for his pride and when i look on the majest river bar by the mighti cliff with it glitter crown of roof and spire overlook the beauti sweep of the st charl i felt that his outburst was more of a declar than a boast i disembark with a light heart and guid by gabriel climb the steep ascent to the haut vill at the head of which stood the sarenn hous there to receiv a welcom from mme de sarenn and angeliqu for which none but a daughter and a sister might look chapter xx at quebec when our first greet were over i ask eager for luci she is not with us at the moment my dear said mme de sarenn but we look for news of her soon now where is she i ask dread to discov the hand of m de sarenn in the matter when you left with le pere jean she was much distress for she had not the same relianc on his assur of your safeti as we and at first insist that you would never have will gone without her but after a while she seem to be content i did not know until angeliqu told me later that she was possess with the idea of her son be in quebec or i might have persuad her of it folli but i knew noth of it and thought she was quit content to await your

who was kind to me and i will pray for each one everi night luci it is as i thought said mme de sarenn poor soul i am more distress at the thought of her unrest than for her safeti for our peopl are veri good particular to ani one they see is not of strong mind she had some money angeliqu tell me i have sent her descript to the differ convent where they are like to know of ani one in want and in

thought of this innoc betray of my presenc to hugh i could hard find courag to repli and it was fortun that my answer serv as a cover to my confus m de montcalm i have never heard from or written to my brother sinc he accept his english commiss i said in a trembl voic pardon madam i had forgotten when i spoke just as we forget monsieur that our marguerit is not one of us by birth as she is in heart cri angeliqu enthusiast slip her arm about me this shew me more than ani other happen how precari my posit was for though neither angeliqu nor her mother nor m de montcalm would now mention my

shall never urg you again to talk of ball and rout and game as necess when the peopl are starv within our veri wall what wonder is it our husband and brother and son say these faineant care naught what becom of the countri or the peopl so long as they gain some littl distinct which may entitl them to an earli return and an empti decor they have neither piti nor faith nor the slightest interest in the caus for which they are fight if m de vaudreuil whom they pretend to despis were permit to take the field himself with a few thousand good canadian behind him we would hear a differ stori think you if my son had been permit to reach louisbourg it would have fallen no a thousand time no and it is the same elsewher who repuls the english charg at carillon the canadian who bring everi import piec of news of the enemi some despis canadian who know how to fight and how to handl themselv in the wood canadian and onli canadian and these are the men they affect to despis and it is canadian

your do among a cliqu i despis from top to bottom and the indign old ladi stop worn out for veri lack of breath while angeliqu made a littl laugh grimac at me and fled the indict was sever but there was much truth in it at the same time the condit of the peopl was pitiabl in the extrem provis were at ruinous price the wretch paper money was almost worthless and even the offic were beggar by their necessari expens at the open of the new year the intend was invad by a crowd of desper women clamour for relief and the address of m bigot in rid himself of his unwelcom visitor was laugh at as a joke wors than this no attempt was made to lessen or even hide the gaieti that went on play was as high and as ruinous as ever and the town was all agog over the report of a ball to be given with unusu splendour by the intend on twelfth night it was true that he made a daili distribut of food at his door that he spake pleasant and reassur word to the suffer peopl that he even permit the respect dress among them to enter and view his guest from the galleri of his ball room but this did but serv to intensifi the bitter and indign of those who stood apart from him and his follow it would be unjust to brand m de montcalm and perhap other as will particip in these excess on account of their posit their presenc at all formal entertain was a necess and certain the town offer no distract of

impuls flash across me to enter and learn the worst but i shrank appal at the thought of expos myself to further humili in my seek for some escap i even question if i had heard aright it seem imposs that there should not be some explan that there was not some horribl mistak and a fierc anger swept over me at the injustic of it all had i wast the love of my youthth love of my lifeon a man whom i had endow with everi nobl qualiti of which i could conceiv to find that he was onli of the same common clay as other whose advanc i had ignor becaus i had set him so high in my anger i put him beneath all other becaus as a silli girl i had been blind by my own delus and as a foolish woman i had gone on dream the dream of a girl the thought too of luci have been so close to me all these month and of how near i had confid in her stung me like a blow and this was the end i had wast everi affect of my natur in blind worship of the idol which now lay shatter at the first blow i had wander with

thought by so do he could bend me to his will whi had i never look at this with the same eye the same brain i had use in other matter in other matter i had conduct myself as a reason woman should but in this the weightiest affair in my life had i wander without sane thought without ani guid save impuls so unreason that they could scarc have even sway my judgment in other thing then my anger have pass i saw the whole incred folli of my life and alon and in bitter miseri i trod the valley of humili until with weari soul and soften heart i knelt and pray for deliver when i return to the hous the effort to meet and talk with other did much to restor me to myself angeliqu i could see was great excit and it was a pain to think that what to me was a bitter degrad and the wreck of all my hope could possibl be look upon by a young and innoc girl as a piec of curious surmis perhap to be laugh over and specul upon without a thought of the miseri it entail in my room that night i reason out my whole posit calm from the begin and with a chill fear i saw myself confront by a new humili had i not in my infatu misconstru everi littl kind on the part of hugh everi express of sympathi and of ordinari courtesi nay everi smile and look and word into a languag which exist onli in my credul imagin had he ever spoken a singl word of love to me had he not even refus to answer my girlish appeal to him at our part was it then possibl that i was not onli in a fals posit now but that i had throughout been play that most contempt of all rolesth infatu woman who imagin herself belov by one indiffer to her i was overwhelm with shame at the thought still turn it as i might i could not see that it admit of ani other conclus yet ignomini as it all was it must be face for it was imposs that i should go on lament or live in the miseri of constant self reproach if i had had the courag to defi the world in my quixot endeavour to right the suppos wrong of anoth should i not put forth some measur of the same courag to protect myself becaus i had met with a disast humbl to my self respect and pride sure i was not forc to proclaim my own defeat to the world and thus add ridicul to humili cost what it might i determin to put forth everi endeavour to prevent hugh even suspect the true motiv of my presenc in canada until the time should come when i might return in safeti it cost me an effort to return to luci i had almost a dislik to see her again but my pride came to my support and when i went i saw i had exagger the difficulti for i found a differ creatur await me whatev suffer i had gone through it was clear this poor soul had gain some great relief and my selfish was not proof against her content she had forgotten that i had been besid her when hugh had enter the great of his revel whatev it had been had swept away all smaller thing and she lay there with a new light in her face but as quiet and self contain as befor had she spoken i could not have born it my courag in respect to hugh was not immedi put to the proof as he had been order off to montreal there to join m de levi as aid de camp and i had both time and freedom for decis much to angeliqu delight i now accompani her to all the ball and junket that went on for i had noth further to fear and ala noth to hope m de montcalm and the other receiv me with warm welcom and made a small ovat over my appear i

put but at this rebuff but turn toward the other and went on angrili of cours a woman has no right to an opinion in the face of such an author as m joann but i am sure so patriot a brother will be interest in such a sister letter and that the authent news she may send from quebec cannot fail to be of interest to his superior it may be the part of an affection sister ambiti for her brother advanc but hard that of a friend to be encourag by us there that is what i believ and if you other are too blind to see behind a pretti face and a disconsol manner so much the wors for us all marguerit my dear there wasnt a man in the room who didnt protest against her ungener suspicion i was proud of them all but none of the women said a word and the spite littl creatur stuck to her

enough i could not but feel the effect of such a report nor fail to recognis there was oftentim a gall restraint on my appear which was onli aggrav by the too evid effort of my champion toward it dissip but all such social jealousi and plot were scatter by the approach of spring when an unend activ pervad all class throughout the coloni the arriv of the first ship was look for with anxieti as they would bring the messag of peac or renew hostil which to me meant either escap or a continu of my difficulti it was m joann who brought me the news well madam it seem it is to be war but instead

too wearili even at my own distanc to wish for ani nearer approach i stood with angeliqu one even in the garden of the hotel dieu and even here the engin had erect a batteri overhang the steep cliff

the hospit stood in the valley of the st charl somewhat less than a mile from the town with the river sweep in a great bend on the one side and the steep height at the end of which the town stood rise on the other we were cut off from ani view of the st lawrenc but the sight of the bridg of boat with it hornwork across the tongu of land enclos by the sweep of the river and the wall of the town crown the height kept us in touch with the struggl go on between us and the english who still held the st lawrenc with it opposit shore the convent itself was a pile of grey stone build form a

height of quebec christoph was at onc examin by m arnoux the surgeon who oblig came at angeliqu request and befor long he met us to report that his patient was in no danger his wound was dress and a night sleep would go far to put him on his feet again he could be seen without even fatigu on the morrow i left word with the sister in charg that she should tell him i was in the convent and would

and i never thought of the other danger at all i was so happi when i fell into english hand and was allow to enlist in boston and in fraser highland too not in a coloni regiment and when we found

confus and i never doubt for a moment i should find her here the next day the surgeon pronounc him out of all possibl danger and ad signific if his mother is to see him it is best it should be at onc thereupon i obtain the necessari permiss and never have i seen greater joy in a face than in luci when i usher christoph into her room that same even as i sate besid her though she lay quiet and compos i notic a grave chang had come over her and call one of the sister who had had much experi she at onc said the end was near with the permiss of the superior i went for christoph and led him white and awestruck to the bedsid of his mother she ask that i would not leaveif it be not a troubl to you madam the poor thing plead pitifullyand i remain besid them christoph she said with an effort

in russia seek eager some mean of return to us though i was persuad he had desert me when he return and was will to acknowledg me as his wife i was harden into a heartless woman believ myself separ by what i ignor call god grace from him and the world to which he belong in my pride i refus to let him come into our live though he implor me to let him make such restitut as was in his power he behav as few men would have done for the sake of the old love he bore with me and accept my conditionsthat he would never mention our marriag and would never come between you and me he let you go away from his side in louisbourg though his heart was yearn for you becaus his honour a qualiti which i pretend not to understand forbad him to forget his promis to me he was alway good to me far beyond my

you see him tell him from me tell hughbut here i silent withdrew leav the mother to whisper her last messag of contrit to the boy kneel besid her bed piti as was poor luci stori i could gather but littl comfort from it it seem to me that in marri out of his own class hugh had commit so grave a fault that whatev follow in the way of misunderstand was but to be expect he had been kind forbear larger mind than she had known she had not even realis the sens of honour which had made her a wife and not a mistress it had gone the way of all mistak and produc noth but bitter and regret from it i could gather no excus no justif of his conduct toward me he had allow my affect to grow up and centr in him without a warn i could understand of the heart break which confront me and i could not see that his oblig toward her who had cast his love asid was more sacr than to her to whom it was all in all we laid luci to rest in the garden of the hospitalwithout the rite of the church it is true but not without both prayer and tear and then took up the daili round of duti onc more christoph be no longer a patient was order off to the town as a prison but i sent with him a note to m joann which secur him generous treatment through the month of august the wound continu to come in and though our troop were starv as they stood behind their line of defenc they were one and all hope of the result

recal in an instant they were besid us a sergeant and six men all highland i was about to speak again but befor i could do so margaret step up to the sergeant and take him by the sleev whisper a few word in his ear he thereupon gave some instruct in gaelic to his men who close round me and the priest and move off a few pace with her they spake earnest togeth for a littl what she said i do not

help you must both follow us into the town he gave his order briefli and blow out the lanthorn took margaret by the arm support her as one might a wound man and so we set off it was evid the quick wit sergeant possess that invalu qualif of the success soldier the readi to carri out as well as to devis a plan for in handl the lanthorn he had never onc allow the light to fall on margaret and by his happi pretenc of her be wound he avoid the awkward necess of hand over the command to her as his superior that he would do his best to shelter her from ani scrutini or question was evid and i was too thank for the result to puzzl over the probabl mean by which it was attain as like as not by the veri simpl expedi of tell the trutha wonder efficaci measur at time when you know your man a quick hard scrambl brought us down to the level of the palai we pass the intend black and desert and so on toward the foot of the cote du palai when we reach the gate the sergeant halt us the sign and countersign were given whereupon the wicket was open pass his arm about margaret who lean upon him heavili the sergeant skil interpos himself between her and the offic in charg and gave his report neil murray sergeant 78th six men two prison and one of our own wound and on we march up the slipperi hill without a moment unnecessari delay as soon as we were beyond sight of the gate our pace was slacken and now that all immedi danger of discoveri for margaret was at an end i fell to wonder at the extraordinari chanc which again brought me face to face with her who had prove the turn point in my life littl by littl i piec out the puzzl and the more i brought it togeth the more i wonder but in a vagu disjoint fashion that led to no solut my confus thought were interrupt by our parti halt in front of the convent of the ursulin where to my relief i saw the sergeant lead margaret round toward the side entranc may i ask where you are take us i said when we again began our march put the question more to set my mind work again than out of curios where els would we be go but to the general and where has he found quarter in this stone heap you have made a fine mess of thing with your batter i said for the evid of their fire on the town was surpris have we not he exclaim with true soldier pride but there will be a corner or two here and there that was out of our reach it was a god merci for ourselv that we didnt have our will of the whole town or there mani a poor fellow would have made a bad winter of it i dare say you found it bad enough as it was eh neil you may say that sir there been a deal to put up with for both high and low but here we will be at the general as he spake we drew up befor a hous in the rue st loui and were usher into an anteroom where we were left under guard while our conductor depart to make his report i was not permit to speak with my fellow prison and so went back to my wonder it was margaretthat is mme de st justwho had befriend luci on shipboard and protect her sinc what a marvel happen that these two women of all other in the world should have thus been thrown togeth that she now knew of my relat toward luci i could not doubt and though i had prefer it might have come about otherwis i bitter reflect that an estim of my charact was no longer of suprem import to her now she was a marri woman though i had been do my utmost all these year of exil to school myself to a frame of mind in which i might look upon her as unapproach for me now that i found an insurmount barrier exist not of my own rais with the inconsist of mankind i straight rebel against it what a climax to everi ironi of fate to find myself free and she whom i had so hopeless love anoth yet what did the priest mean when he said he had been tri to keep me from her i look across the room at his impass face and felt i would give much for five minut alon with him then an explan would be forthcom in some shape from this coil i was arous by the entranc of an offic to summon us into the presenc of the general and for the first time i consid my person situat not that i had anyth to fear for in those day war was a profess and an offic was treat as a gentleman by his oppon onc activ hostil ceas or were even suspend but the consequ of my captur would certain mean for me the loss of ani advantag i might otherwis have gain from our success now my name would figur in no despatch unless as miss a bitter disappoint when i had so slowli and pain gain someth of a posit but i had no time to reason it out befor we had cross the threshold of the general room he was a clear featur bright eye man of thirti five or forti visibl harass with the hard fortun of the day but he did not allow his preoccup to affect his bear toward us reverend sir he said address the priest i take it for grant you are a non combat but as it has fallen to your lot to be brought within our line you must perforc remain a prison if you will satisfi me as to your name

is jean mari gaston de caldegu vicomt de trincardel but for year i have born none other than le pere jean missionari to the indian that is perfect satisfactori sir i shall be pleas to allow you parol within the wall onli restrict you from approach those part of the town where our defenc are now place i shall give you an order for quarter at the ursulin though doubtless the good ladi would readili receiv you even without my introduct as he spake he accompani the priest to the door where he gave his instruct to an aid in wait he then turn to me and extend his hand chevali we have alreadi had the pleasur of some slight correspond i have to thank your excel for as great a courtesi as one man can shew toward anoth when i wrote i ventur to mention my acquaint with your excel brother lord elibank

to be gain by undu conceal and his consider spare me ani embarrass when our interview end he thank me veri handsom and regret he could not offer me the hospit of his own roof but provid for me in the ursulin grant me the same parol as the priest you will find among your countrymen an odd rebel here and there kirkconnel but i reli on you to stir up no fresh treason with white cockad or bonni char or ani other of the old shibboleth have no anxieti on that score your excel i have had too rude an awaken ever to fall a dream again the burnt child and i bow and left in compani with the offic told off to see to my recept the general unlook for sympathi had gone far to restor me to my natur bear for the moment it is flatter to ani man to be receiv by his militari superior as a social equal and heaven forbid that i should pretend to a suscept less than the ordinari i was great pleas therefor by his recognit and to my admir of his soldier qualiti was now ad a warm appreci of his interest in me and my fortun but no person gratif could long blind me to the miseri of my real posit chanc inclin and i think i may honest add principl had kept my affect disengag and my heart whole without ani reason expect of ever realis my life desir and now i had stumbl upon it onli to find it inexor withheld from me and everi avenu to it attain close could i have gone on to the end without actual meet with margaret i could have born it with the silent endur which had support me so far and had in larg measur becom a habit but now everi regret everi passion long everi haunt memori which time had lull into seem slumber awok to wring my heart at the veri moment when i believ the bitter to have pass forev the first to welcom me at the convent was my son kit heaven how tall and well look the boy had grown and with what feel did i take him in my arm he return my embrac with equal affect and when we settl down spake of his mother death with much natur feel poor luci she had had a narrow life of it with the except of the year we had live togeth what a light heart merri littl soul she then was she had no educ in the general sens but was possess of so live a sympathi that she enter into all that appeal to me with an enjoy and an appreci that no mere learn could have suppli she may have lack the bear and carriag of a great ladi but what stateli of manner can rival the pretti soft of a gentl girl wholli in love she was not strict beauti but she had the charm of constant liveli and her unfail content and merriment more than made up for ani irregular in featur this was the woman i had left and i have alreadi told what she was when i return it was not so much her natur that was at fault poor thing as the atrophi of soul result from an ungener form of religion i cannot but think it safer for both man and woman to continu in those religion which have receiv the sanction of author than take up with ani new ventur no matter what superior offer of salvat they may hold out and the first step toward this danger ground i believ to be that pernici habit of idl specul on subject too sacr for open discuss which might well be left to their ordain guardian and not to the curious guess of simpl and unsophist mind kit had much inform to give touch other in whom i was interest of mme de st just he spake as i would have expect with the warmest admir and gratitud but after he had inform me that she was an inmat of the same convent in which we were i turn the convers toward her brother who i learn was wound suffici to be under the surgeon care and was pleas to gather that master kit had made a respect show for himself in the rescu of his captain that mademoisell de sarenn was much concern in nairn condit i was glad to hear as such an interest could not fail to be of servic when she should learn of her brother fate of which i took care to make no mention as i had no desir to figur as the bearer of what must to her prove pain tide your captain is fortun to engag the sympathi of so

not so mani year ago and i do not know that he was deeper in the affair than i that i am not a veri ardent rebel i will confess but i have grown too old in rebellion to shift my charact readili besid i fanci i am more of a frenchman than an englishman or even a scotchman and the worst of such a transmogrif is that one grow use to it and chang becom wellnigh imposs but you have chosen wise my boy i wouldnt have you differ for the world it is not for myself i speak i am think of you sir god bless you kit i would rather have those word from you than a free pardon and now good night or rather good day you have your duti befor you and i must get some sleep and i embrac the generous boy with a full heart the next afternoon i set out to look over the town and mark the effect of the english fire dure the bombard and could not but admir how destruct it had been nor withhold my approv of the effort the garrison had put forth dure the past winter to repair the result of their own handiwork as i wander round the cape i caught sight of le pere jean lean against the parapet of la batteri du clerg gloomili survey the dismal prospect of a river full of drift ice and a desol and half frozen countri beyond he turn as i approach and greet me with a return of the manner that was onc habitu with him i was glad to hear you found friend last night chevali thank you yes i found friend both new and old i answer glanc at him curious but he had turn toward the river again and wave his hand outward this is all emblemat of our fortress i fear dissolut he said wearili one might descant on the promis of spring and the renew of hope but in realiti i gather as littl from the prospect as you do i return and side by side we lean over the parapet and continu to indulg our cheerless specul in silenc chevali said the priest sudden but in his usual tone and without chang his posit perhap i owe you a more formal apolog than was possibl last night but when i found that mademoisell nairn mme de st just i correct it is scarc worth while to keep up that fiction between us he said as if waiv the most ordinari form in the world and in some manner i check the cri of astonish that was on my lip and remain silent while he continu when i found mademoisell nairn in your compani i too hastili assum that it was by design on your part i was so bewild by this unconsci revel that i could make no repli but fortun he did not mark my agit and went on as though speak to himself right or wrong i have been the mean of keep her from you thus far and if i have sin in so do i must bear the consequ as he spake he turn and face me but by this i had recov command of myself and saw that his thin face was flush and drawn with suffer let me go on he said with decis i owe an explan to myself as well as to you just what he said i cannot clear recal the revel he had made was so astound had so complet chang the whole complexion of my outlook that my brain could scarc apprehend the import of his word i onli realis that margaret was no longer beyond my reach the rest matter not one whit when he ceas speak i briefli expos what had been my posit throughout without reserv or argument leav it to him to draw his own conclus chevali cri the priest heartili as i end i feel that ani apolog would be frivol in the face of what you have told me but i can assur you no man was ever more satisfi to find himself in the wrong than i i take that as more than ani apolog i return as sincer but to return to sarenn what use did he make of my letter he attempt such a use that the outcom of your meet with him is fulli justifi it was justifi as it was i object i do not fight on trifl do you mean he tri to persuad margaret that it refer to her he did and though i was enabl to save her from person danger i could do noth to reliev the distress he had wrought by these mean the hound it would have been a satisfact to have known this when i met him rememb though it is entir owe to the loyalti of his mother and sister that her posit here has been possibl that is true but i see as clear that her recept by them was onli possibl through your answer for her i owe you everyth you owe me much he said quiet as if to himself and at the simpl word of self abneg my heart ach at the thought of the pain i had involuntarili caus i am sorri for ani famili that hold so black a sheep as sarenn i said to break the awkward paus that follow his famili need know noth beyond that he die on the field of battl a much more desir fate than he was like to meet with in franc had he live for believ me inform has gone forward that will insur the trial and i trust the punish of everi pecul who has help to ruin this miser coloni no matter which way the present crisi may turn now that we have confid in each other may i ask whi you never let me know of your presenc in canada to be frank i had no desir to awaken old associ so far as i knew the past was a book that had been read and done with noth was to be gain by reopen it under the same condit and i had no reason to suppos they could be alter rememb it is onli now my eye have been open and i see the error of my warp and ignor judgment we have travel a long road chevali to meet in friendship and i am glad we can so meet at last i alway regret when my feel toward an honour man cannot go beyond mere like gaston i cri i never receiv so handsom a compliment in all my life chapter xxviii i make a fals move i can make no pretenc to marshal the train of thought that swept through my brain when the priest took his way and left me to myself engross as i was with my own affair i could not but specul on the curious chanc that had driven him into a life of renunci and me to one of exil at the same time and for the same caus and that now brought us togeth befor the woman we both love i use the word advis and without ani reflect on his integr but it would be an insult to my intellig could i look on his face worn by suffer and emot and mark the tone of his voic and most confirmatori of all the jealous care with which he avoid ani mention of her name and not acknowledg the presenc there of the gentlest passion that ever refin the soul of man he had found abund opportun for self denial and sacrific in the career he had chosen but i doubt if he had found either peac or entir resign dure his interview with general murray and especi dure his familiar talk with me i had caught a dozen reflect of his old bear and manner and i could not believ he had laid asid all human long and emot howev he might refus to recognis them when he dof the outward habit of his class for the soutan and shovel hat of the jesuit it were childish to think so thus occupi i sate heedless of the hour that went by until chill by the chang of the day to even as i move slowli toward my quarter the onli result of the hour of solitari thought that remain by me was that margaret was unmarri and that she had come out to meet with me and for this alon that same even i paid my respect to the superior la mere do la nativit a well bred woman who should have grace the world rather than a convent and to her i proffer my request that i might be allow to wait upon mme de st just most certain monsieur if it be her desir she is a guest to whom we owe much if you will permit i will send and inquir in a few moment the sister sent return with word that mme de st just would see the chevali de maxwel at eleven the next morn veri well monsieur you may then meet her here in the parlour ad the superior pleasant and i bow my thank and withdrew i spent the night in great unrest invent imaginari difficulti when i overthrew those which realli exist pictur the expect interview in a thousand form frame and refram everi appeal i should make and so wore out the night in a fever of consum anticip i was thank i had been captur while on staff duti for i had ever made it a practic to dress myself with the most scrupul attent when go into action so that death himself might not find me unpreparedand thank to this i was now enabl to make a fit appear the feel that i was outward prepar went far to reassur me and when the time came for my meet i had banish my uneasi apprehens of the night and recov my habitu confid my sole anxieti was lest i should fail in convey an adequ impress of my appreci of her sacrific and undertak for my sake but when i saw her everi doubt fled i do not know how she was dress beyond that it serv but to heighten her queen beauti which rare as i rememb it had now grown and develop beyond all my faint concept her amber hair had deepen into the richest auburn it colour was undisguis by powder and it abund undistort by the art of the hair dresser her eye were steadi and clear and truth everi line of her face had round out the promis of her youth and her shape and carriag were divin she move like a goddess margaret i said as i advanc toward her forget all the open i had so care rehears i can scarc believ i am awak it seem incred i should speak face to face with you here it is inde a strang meet she return the word were noth but they were spoken in a tone of perfect quiet and control without ani trace of the emot that broke my voic and dissip my self possess it is a meet for which i have dream but tri not to hope i said with much feel and i had live for noth els she return with unfalt voic and the same absenc of emot then margaret it has come at last i cri joyous the temporari cloud pass as she spake no it has not she said with the coldest decis and with that incongru of thought which spring upon us at the most inopportun moment i wonder if everi woman for whom i care was to chang her whole natur the moment i left her side i rememb luci and now here was margaret whom i had known as the embodi of impuls affect fenc with a cool that enforc my admir i saw she had fulli prepar herself and instant i resolv to chang my ground margaret i said fall back on the most unstudi tone at my command it was onli yesterday i learn from gaston the true reason of your presenc here we have both suffer too cruelli from the accid of the past to risk ani misunderstand now for the want of perfect open between us that is what i desir abov all thing in the world she answer then let us begin at the begin whi was it you never let me know of your plan i do not hold that ani explan is due on my part she repli still in the same tone of self possess rememb i did not seek this interview and i do not see that you have ani right to question me on matter which concern onli myself great heaven margaret can anyth concern you and not touch me onc i believ it could not i am older now how can you speak thus cold i cri shock at her incred calm if there is anyth i can do or say for heaven sake demand it you cannot know

somewhat move whi did you never tell me of her how could i there was noth dishonour about it a thing doe not need to be dishonour to be ruinous the dishonour would have been in my speak when i was pledg to silenc was it more honour think you to allow a young girl to live in a world of mock affect and to expos her to what i have gone through but did i ever by word or sign make the slightest move to engag your affect after i discov the truth pardon me if i say that question could onli serv to embarrass a child i will answer it by anoth doe a man need to speak to declar his love no by heaven he doe not margaret i cri throw all defenc to the wind it speak in everi tone of his voic in everi glanc of his eye and i would be a hypocrit beneath contempt were i to pretend i did not alway love you i love you from the moment i first saw you a girl befor templ bar and i will love you god help me till i die if this be the case then had i not a higher claim on you than ani woman live were you not bound to protect me against my ignor of such a barrier absenc and i had hope forget would prove your best protect i repli with happi inspir the implic is skil she said quiet without a trace of the emot i expect from my allus but no mistak on my part can serv to lessen your want of good faith toward me do you think a woman would have consid ani point of person honour where the life of one dearest to her hung on her sacrific it is quit beyond my poor power to judg of what a woman might do i repli with a sudden rash indiscret i find i have but littl knowledg of women or the motiv which sway them then there is but littl to be gain by continu this convers she return with a state bow and swept out of the room leav me to curs the folli that had betray me into so fals a move and with this bitter morsel for reflect i sought my solitari room noth in the world short of actual dishonour can caus a man of sensibl keener suffer than the knowledg that he has made a fool of himself this i had done to the top of my bent whi had i not apprehend the effect point of attack from the outset and instead of attempt ani defenc thrown myself on her compass and generos whi had i not but it were futil to reiter the charg i brought against my own folli what was the support on which she reli if her brotherthen i regret from the bottom of my heart i had miss the occas of squar that account of which he had spoken if a man at all it was he for the woman who had so discomfit me was heart whole i could swear a defiant modesti rang in everi note of her voic possibl the convent that fallaci sanctuari for disappoint but if i knew anyth of her sex she was the last to whom such a retreat could bring satisfact heaven it was a coil involv enough to drive a man wellnigh distract dinner and the intercours it entail did much to restor me to my ordinari bear and when kit sought me in the afternoon with a polit request from his captain that i would wait upon him when at leisur i had quit recov noth could have fallen out more to my like i was anxious to discov his caus of quarrel with me and if possibl to arriv at some solut of margaret attitud so i follow kit to his room at onc nairn i

favour mark by the general and also by our colonel let me see he is a son of old lovat is he not that he is and in more way than one if he be like his saint father he will have a longer memori for his
