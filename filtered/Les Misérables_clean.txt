arrog in a poor priest to ride an anim which was use by jesus christ i have done so from necess i assur you and not from vaniti in the cours of these trip he was kind and indulg and talk rather than preach he never went far in search of his argument and his exampl he quot to the inhabit of one district the exampl of a neighbor district in the canton where they were harsh to the poor he said look at the peopl of briancon they have confer on the poor on widow and orphan the right to have their meadow mown three day in advanc of everi one els they rebuild their hous for them gratuit when they are ruin therefor it is a countri which is bless by god for a whole centuri there has not been a singl murder among them in villag which were greedi for profit and harvest he said look at the peopl of

have taken the pictur down to dust the bishop had discov these particular written in whitish ink on a littl squar of paper yellow by time and attach to the back of the portrait of the abb of grand champ with four wafer at his window he had an antiqu curtain of a coars woollen stuff which final becam so old that in order to avoid the expens of a new one madam magloir was forc to take a larg seam in the veri middl of it this seam took the form of a cross the bishop often call attent to it how delight that is he said all the room in the hous without except those on the ground floor as well as those on the first floor were white wash which is a fashion in barrack and hospit howev in their latter year madam magloir discov beneath the paper which had been wash over paint ornament the apart of mademoisell baptistin as we shall see further on befor becom a hospit this hous had been the ancient parliament hous of the bourgeoi henc this decor the chamber were pave in red brick which were wash everi week with straw mat in front of all the bed altogeth this dwell which was attend to by the two women was exquisit clean from top to bottom this was the sole luxuri which the bishop permit he said that take noth from the poor it must be confess howev that he still retain from his former possess six silver knive and fork and a soup ladl which madam magloir contempl everi day with delight as they glisten splendid upon the coars linen cloth and sinc we are now paint the bishop of d as he was in realiti we must add that he had said more than onc i find it difficult to renounc eat from silver dish to this silverwar must be ad two larg candlestick of massiv silver which he had inherit from a great aunt these candlestick held two wax candl and usual figur on the bishop chimney piec when he had ani one to dinner madam magloir light the two candl and set the candlestick on the tabl in the bishop own chamber at the head of his bed there was a small cupboard in which madam magloir lock up the six silver knive and fork and the big spoon everi night but it is necessari to add that the key was never remov the garden which had been rather spoil by the ugli build which we have mention was compos of four alley in cross form radiat from a tank anoth walk made the circuit of the garden and skirt the white wall which enclos it these alley left behind them four squar plot rim with box in three of these madam magloir cultiv veget in the fourth the bishop had plant some flower here and there stood a few fruit tree madam magloir had onc remark with a sort of gentl malic monseigneur you who turn everyth to account have nevertheless one useless plot it would be better to grow salad there than bouquet madam magloir retort the bishop you are mistaken the beauti is as use as the use he ad after a paus more so perhap this plot consist of three or four bed occupi the bishop almost as much as did his book he like to pass an hour or two there trim hoe and make hole here and there in the earth into which he drop seed he was not as hostil to insect as a garden could have wish to see him moreov he made no pretens to botani he ignor group and consist he made not the slightest effort to decid between tournefort and the natur method he took part neither with the bud against the cotyledon nor with jussieu against linnaeus he did not studi plant he love flower he respect learn men great he respect the ignor still more and without ever fail in these two respect he water his flower bed everi summer even with a tin water pot paint green the hous had not a singl door which could be lock the door of the dine room which as we have said open direct on the cathedr squar had former been ornament with lock and bolt like the door of a prison the bishop had had all this ironwork remov and this door was never fasten either by night or by day with anyth except the latch all that the first passerbi had to do at ani hour was to give it a push at first the two women had been veri much tri by this door which was never fasten but monsieur de d had said to them have bolt put on your room if that will pleas you they had end by share his confid or by at least act as though they share it madam magloir alon had fright from time to time as for the bishop his thought can be found explain or at least indic in the three line which he wrote on the margin of a bibl this is the shade of differ the door of the physician should never be shut the door of the priest should alway be open on anoth book entitl philosophi of the medic scienc he had written this other note am not i a physician like them i also have my patient and then too i have some whom i call my unfortun again he wrote do not inquir the name of him who ask a shelter of you the veri man who is embarrass by his name is the one who need shelter it chanc that a worthi cure i know not whether it was the cure of couloubroux or the cure of pompierri took it into his head to ask him one day probabl at the instig of madam magloir whether monsieur was sure that he was not commit an indiscret to a certain extent in leav his door unfasten day and night at the merci of ani one who should choos to enter and whether in short he did not fear lest some misfortun might occur in a hous so littl guard the bishop touch his shoulder with gentl graviti and said to him nisi dominus custodierit domum in vanum vigil qui custodiunt eam unless the lord guard the hous in vain do they watch who guard it then he spoke of someth els he was fond of say there is a braveri of the priest as well as the braveri of a colonel of dragoonson he ad our must be tranquil chapter viicravatt it is here that a fact fall natur into place which we must not omit becaus it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of a man the

had been a terribl man how did it happen that such a man had not been brought befor a provost court on the return of the legitim princ they need not have cut off his head if you pleas clemenc must be exercis agre but a good banish for life an exampl in short etc besid he was an atheist like all the rest of those peopl gossip of the gees about the vultur was g a vultur after all yes if he were to be judg by the element of feroc in this solitud of his as he had not vote for the death of the king he had not been includ in the decre of exil and had been abl to remain in franc he dwelt at a distanc of three quarter of an hour from the citi far from ani hamlet far from ani road in some hidden turn of a veri wild valley no one knew exact where he had there it was said a sort of field a hole a lair there were no neighbor not even passer by sinc he had dwelt in that valley the path which led thither had disappear under a growth of grass the local was spoken of as though it had been the dwell of a hangman nevertheless the bishop medit on the subject and from time to time he gaze at the horizon at a point where a clump of tree mark the valley of the former member of the convent and he said there is a soul yonder which is lone and he ad deep in his own mind i owe him a visit but let us avow it this idea which seem natur at the first blush appear to him after a moment reflect as strang imposs and almost repuls for at bottom he share the general impress and the old member of the convent inspir him without his be clear conscious of the fact himself with that sentiment which border on hate and which is so well express by the word estrang still should the scab of the sheep caus the shepherd to recoil no but what a sheep the good bishop was perplex sometim he set out in

wretch was die that paralysi was gain on him and that he would not live over nightthank god some ad the bishop took his staff put on his cloak on account of his too threadbar cassock as we have mention and becaus of the even breez which was sure to rise soon and set out the sun was set and had almost touch the horizon when the bishop arriv at the excommun spot with a certain beat of the heart he recogn the fact that he was near the lair he strode over a ditch leap a hedg made his way through a fenc of dead bough enter a neglect paddock took a few step with a good deal of bold and sudden at the extrem of the wast land and behind lofti brambl he caught sight of the cavern it was a veri low hut poor small and clean with a vine nail against the outsid near the door in an old wheel chair the arm chair of the peasant there was a white hair man smile at the sun near the seat man stood a young boy the shepherd lad he was offer the old man a jar of milk while the bishop was watch him the old man spoke thank you he said i need noth and his smile quit the sun to rest upon the child the bishop step forward at the sound which he made in walk the old man turn his head and his face express the sum total of the surpris which a man can still feel after a long life this is the first time sinc i have been here said he that ani one has enter here who are you sir the bishop answer my

that moment one has one capric i should have like to last until the dawn but i know that i shall hard live three hour it will be night then what doe it matter after all die is a simpl affair one has no need of the light for that so be it i shall die by starlight the old man turn to the shepherd lad go to thi bed thou wert awak all last night thou art tire the child enter the hut the old man follow him with his eye and ad as though speak to himself i shall die while he sleep the two slumber may be good neighbor the bishop was not touch as it seem that he should have been he did not think he discern god in this manner of die let us say the whole for these petti contradict of great heart must be indic like the rest he who on occas was so fond of laugh at his grace was rather shock at not be address as monseigneur and he was almost tempt to retort citizen he was assail by a fanci for peevish familiar common enough to doctor and priest but which was not habitu with him this man after all this member of the convent this repres of the peopl had been one of the power one of the earth for the first time in his life probabl the bishop felt in a mood to be sever meanwhil the

there if the infinit had no person person would be without limit it would not be infinit in other word it would not exist there is then an i that i of the infinit is god the die man had pronounc these last word in a loud voic and with the shiver of ecstasi as though he beheld some one when he had spoken his eye close the effort had exhaust him it was evid that he had just live through in a moment the few hour which had been left to him that which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in death the suprem moment was approach the bishop understood this time press it was as a priest that he had come from extrem cold he had pass by degre to extrem emot he gaze at those close eye he took that wrinkl age and ice cold hand in his and bent over the die man this hour is the hour of god do you not think that it would be regrett if we had met in vain the conventionari open his eye again a graviti mingl with gloom was imprint on his counten bishop said he with a slow which probabl aros more

am eighti six year old i am on the point of death what is it that you have come to ask of me your bless said the bishop and he knelt down when the bishop rais his head again the face of the conventionari had becom august he had just expir the bishop return home deepli absorb in thought which cannot be known to us he pass the whole night in prayer on the follow morn some bold and curious person attempt to speak to him about member of the convent g he content himself with point heavenward from that moment he redoubl his tender and brother feel toward all children and suffer ani allus to that old wretch of a g caus him to fall into a singular preoccup no one could say that the passag of that soul befor his and the reflect of that grand conscienc upon his did not count for someth in his approach to perfect this pastor visit natur furnish an occas for a murmur of comment in all the littl local coteri was the bedsid of such a die man as that the proper place for a bishop there was evid no convers to be expect all those revolutionist are backslid then whi go there what was there to be seen there he must have been veri curious inde to see a soul carri off by the devil one day a

lucki that those who despis it in a cap rever it in a hat chapter xia restrict we should incur a great risk of deceiv ourselv were we to conclud from this that monseigneur welcom was a philosoph bishop or a patriot cure his meet which may almost be design as his union with conventionari g left behind it in his mind a sort of astonish which render him still more gentl that is all although monseigneur bienvenu was far from be a politician this is perhap the place to indic veri briefli what his attitud was in the event of that epoch suppos that monseigneur bienvenu ever dream of have an attitud let us then go back a few year some time after the elev of m myriel to the episcop the emperor had made him a baron of the empir in compani with mani other bishop the arrest of the pope took place as everi one know on the night of the 5th to the 6th of juli 1809 on this occas m myriel was summon by napoleon to the synod of the bishop of franc and itali conven at pari this synod was held at notr dame and assembl for the first time on the 15th of june 1811 under the presid of cardin fesch m myriel was one of the nineti five bishop who attend it but he was present onli at one sit and at three or four privat confer bishop of a mountain dioces live so veri close to natur in rustic and depriv it appear that he import among these emin personag idea which alter the temperatur of the assembl he veri soon return to d he was interrog as to this speedi return and he repli i embarrass them the outsid air penetr to them through me i produc on them the effect of an open door on anoth occas he said what would you have those gentlemen are princ i am onli a poor peasant bishop the fact is that he displeas them among other strang thing it is said that he chanc to remark one even when he found himself at the hous of one of his most notabl colleagu what beauti clock what beauti carpet what beauti liveri they must be a great troubl i would not have all those superflu cri incess in my ear there are peopl who are hungri there are peopl who are cold there are poor peopl there are poor peopl let us remark by the way that the hatr of luxuri is not an intellig hatr this hatr would involv the hatr of the art nevertheless in churchmen luxuri is wrong except in connect with represent and ceremoni it seem to reveal habit which have veri littl that is charit about them an opul priest is a contradict the priest must keep close to the poor now can one come in contact incess night and day with all this distress all these misfortun and this poverti without have about one own person a littl of that miseri like the dust of labor is it possibl to imagin a man near a brazier who is not warm can one imagin a workman who is work near a furnac and who has neither a sing hair nor blacken nail nor a drop of sweat nor a speck of ash on his face the first proof of chariti in the priest in the bishop especi is poverti this is no doubt what the bishop of d thought it must not be suppos howev that he share what we call the idea of the centuri on certain delic point he took veri littl part in the theolog quarrel of the moment and maintain silenc on question in which church and state were implic but if he had been strong press it seem that he would have been found to be an ultramontan rather than a gallican sinc we are make a portrait and sinc we do not wish to conceal anyth we are forc to add that he was glacial toward napoleon in his declin begin with 1813 he gave in his adher to or applaud all hostil manifest he refus to see him as he pass through on his return from the island of elba and he abstain from order public prayer for the emperor in his dioces dure the hundr day besid his sister mademoisell baptistin he had two brother one a general the other a prefect he wrote to both with toler frequenc he was harsh for a time toward the former becaus hold a command in provenc at the epoch of the disembark at cann the general had put himself at the head of twelv hundr men and had pursu the emperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is desir of allow to escap his correspond with the other brother the ex prefect a fine worthi man who live in retir at pari rue cassett remain more affection thus monseigneur bienvenu also had his hour of parti spirit his hour of bitter his cloud the shadow of the passion of the moment travers this grand and gentl spirit occupi with etern thing certain such a man would have done well not to entertain ani polit opinion let there be no mistak as to our mean we are not confound what is call polit opinion with the grand aspir for progress with the sublim faith patriot democrat human which in our day should be the veri foundat of everi generous intellect without go deepli into question which are onli indirect connect with the subject of this book we will simpli say this it would have been well if monseigneur bienvenu had not been a royalist and if his glanc had never been for a singl instant turn away from that seren contempl in which is distinct discern abov the fiction and the hatr of this world abov the stormi vicissitud of human thing the beam of those three pure radianc truth justic and chariti while admit that it was not for a polit offic that god creat monseigneur welcom we should have understood and admir his protest in the name of right and liberti his proud opposit his just but peril resist to the all power napoleon but that which pleas us in peopl who are rise pleas us less in the case of peopl who are fall we onli love the fray so long as there is danger and in ani case the combat of the first hour have alon the right to be the extermin of the last he who has not been a stubborn accus in prosper should hold his peac in the face of ruin the denunci of success is the onli legitim execution of the fall as for us when provid interven and strike we let it work 1812 commenc to disarm us in 1813 the coward breach of silenc of that taciturn legisl bodi embolden by catastroph possess onli trait which arous indign and it was a crime to applaud in 1814 in the presenc of those marshal who betray in the presenc of that senat which pass from one dunghil to anoth insult after

at their sinist approach when waterloo could be dim discern open befor napoleon the mourn acclam of the armi and the peopl to the condemn of destini had noth laughabl in it and after make all allow

bishop sent for him reprov him gentl and appoint him beadl in the cathedr in the cours of nine year monseigneur bienvenu had by dint of holi deed and gentl manner fill the town of dwith a sort of

we feel ourselv in no mood but respect the conscienc of the just man should be accept on his word moreov certain natur be given we admit the possibl develop of all beauti of human virtu in a belief that differ from our own what did he think of this dogma or of that mysteri these secret of the inner tribun of the conscienc are known onli to the tomb where soul enter nake the point on which we are certain is that the difficulti of faith never resolv themselv into hypocrisi in his case no decay is possibl to the diamond he believ to the extent of his power credo in patrem he often exclaim moreov he drew from good work that amount of satisfact which suffic to the conscienc and which whisper to a man thou art with god the point which we consid it our duti to note is that outsid of and beyond his faith as it were the bishop possess an excess of love it was in that quarter quia multum amavitbecaus he love muchthat he was regard as vulner by serious men grave person and reason peopl favorit locut of our sad world where egot take it word of command from pedantri what was this excess of love it was a seren benevol which overflow men as we have alreadi point out and which on occas extend even to thing he live without disdain he was indulg toward god creation everi man even the best has within him a thoughtless harsh which he reserv for anim the bishop of d had none of that harsh which is peculiar to mani priest nevertheless he did not go as far as the brahmin but he seem to have weigh this say of ecclesiast who knoweth whither the soul of the anim goeth hideous of aspect deform of instinct troubl him not and did not arous his indign he was touch almost soften by them it seem as though he went thought away to seek beyond the bound of life which is appar the caus the explan or

were peculiar to saint franci dassisi and of marcus aurelius one day he sprain his ankl in his effort to avoid step on an ant thus live this just man sometim he fell asleep in his garden and then there was noth more vener possibl monseigneur bienvenu had former been if the stori anent his youth and even in regard to his manhood were to be believ a passion and possibl a violent man his univers suaviti was less an instinct of natur than the result of a grand convict which had filter into his heart through the medium of life and had trickl there slowli thought by thought for in a charact as

appear to be more than sixti he was not tall he was rather plump and in order to combat this tendenc he was fond of take long stroll on foot his step was firm and his form was but slight bent a detail from which we do not pretend to draw ani conclus gregori xvi at the age of eighti held himself erect and smile which did not prevent him from be a bad bishop monseigneur welcom had what the peopl term a fine head but so amiabl was he that they forgot that it was fine when he convers with that infantil gayeti which was one of his charm and of which we have alreadi spoken peopl felt at their eas with him and joy seem to radiat from his whole person his fresh and ruddi complexion his veri white teeth all of which he had preserv and which were display by his smile gave him that open and easi air which caus the remark to be made of a man hes a good fellow and of an old man he is a fine man that it will be recal was the effect which he produc upon napoleon on the first encount and to one who saw him for the first time he was noth in fact but a fine man but if one remain near him for a few hour and beheld him in the least degre pensiv the fine man becam gradual transfigur and took on some

quit full to the brim of good word and good deed nevertheless it was not complet if cold or raini weather prevent his pass an hour or two in his garden befor go to bed and after the two women had retir it seem to be a sort of rite with him to prepar himself for slumber by medit in the presenc of the grand spectacl of the nocturn heaven sometim if the two old women were not asleep they heard him pace slowli along the walk at a veri advanc hour of the night he was there alon commune with himself peac ador compar the seren of his heart with the seren of the ether move amid the dark by the

spirit he felt someth take it flight from him and someth descend into him mysteri exchang of the abyss of the soul with the abyss of the univers he thought of the grandeur and presenc of god of the

enabl him to ador god in his most divin work in turn doe not this comprehend all in fact and what is there left to desir beyond it a littl garden in which to walk and immens in which to dream at one feet that which can be cultiv and pluck over head that which one can studi and medit upon some flower on earth and all the star in the sky chapter xivwhat he thought one last word sinc this sort of detail might particular at the present moment and to use an express now in fashion give to the bishop of d a certain pantheist physiognomi and induc the belief either to his credit or discredit that he entertain one of those person philosophi which are peculiar to our centuri which sometim spring up in solitari spirit and there take on a form and grow until they usurp the place of religion we insist upon it that not one of those person who knew monseigneur welcom would have thought himself author to think anyth of the sort that which enlighten this man was his heart his wisdom was made of the light which come from there no system mani work abstrus specul contain vertigo no there is noth to indic that he risk his mind in apocalyps the apostl may be dare but the bishop must be timid he would probabl have felt a scrupl at sound too far in advanc certain problem which are in a manner reserv for terribl great mind there is a sacr horror beneath the porch of the enigma those gloomi open

love too much and if it is a heresi to pray beyond the text saint theresa and saint jerom would be heret he inclin toward all that groan and all that expiat the univers appear to him like an immens

upon the cloth symmetr arrang befor the three person seat at the tabl chapter ivdetail concern the chees dairi of pontarli now in order to convey an idea of what pass at that tabl we cannot do better

no longer ani relat one had onli one arm i work they have in the countri of pontarli whither you are go monsieur valjean a truli patriarch and truli charm industri my sister it is their chees dairi which they call fruitier then my brother while urg the man to eat explain to him with great minut what these fruitier of pontarli were that they were divid into two class the big barn which belong to the rich and where there are forti or fifti cow which produc from seven to eight thousand chees each summer and the associ fruitier which belong to the poor these are the peasant of mid mountain who hold their cow in common and share the proceed they engag the servic of a chees maker whom they call the grurin the grurin receiv the milk of the associ three time a day and mark the quantiti on a

interspers his word with grace attent to me he recur frequent to that comfort trade of grurin as though he wish the man to understand without advis him direct and harsh that this would afford him a refug one thing struck me this man was what i have told you well neither dure supper nor dure the entir even did my brother utter a singl word with the except of a few word about jesus when he enter which could remind the man of what he was nor of what my brother was to all appear it was an occas for preach him a littl sermon and of impress the bishop on the convict so that a mark of the passag might remain behind this might have appear to ani one els who had this unfortun man in his hand to afford a chanc to nourish his soul as well as his bodi and to bestow upon him some reproach season with moral and advic or a littl commiser with an exhort to conduct himself better in the futur my brother did not even ask him from what countri he came nor what was his histori for in his histori there is a fault and my brother seem to avoid everyth which could remind him of it to such a point did he carri it that at one time when my brother was speak of the mountain of pontarli who exercis a gentl labor near heaven and who he ad are happi becaus they are innoc he stop short fear lest in this remark there might have escap him someth which might wound the man by dint of reflect i think i have comprehend what was pass in my brother heart he was think no doubt that this man whose name is jean valjean had his misfortun onli too vivid present in his mind that the best thing was to divert him from it and to make him believ if onli momentarili that he was a person like ani other by treat him just in his ordinari way is not this inde to understand chariti well is there not dear madam someth truli evangel in this delicaci which abstain from sermon from moral from allus and is not the truest piti when a man has a sore point not to touch it at all it has seem to me that this might have been my brother privat thought in ani case what i can say is that if he entertain all these idea he gave no sign of them from begin to end even to me he was the same as he is everi even and he sup with this jean valjean with the same air and in the same manner in which he would have sup with m gedeon le provost or with the curat of the parish toward the end when he had reach the fig there came a knock at the door it was mother gerbaud with her littl one in her arm my brother kiss the child on the brow and borrow fifteen sous which i had about me to give to mother gerbaud the man was not pay much heed to anyth then he was no longer talk and he seem veri much fatigu after poor old gerbaud had taken her departur my brother said grace then he turn to the man and said to him you must be in great need of your bed madam magloir clear the tabl veri prompt i understood that we must retir in order to allow this travel to go to sleep and we both went up stair nevertheless i sent madam magloir down a moment later to carri to the man bed a goat skin from the black forest which was in my room the night are frigid and that keep one warm it is a piti that this skin is old all the hair is fall out my brother bought it while he was in germani at tottlingen near the sourc of the danub as well as the littl ivori handl knife which i use at tabl madam magloir return immedi we said our prayer in the draw room where we hang up the linen and then we each retir to our own chamber without say a word to each other chapter vtranquil after bid his sister good night monseigneur bienvenu took one of the two silver candlestick from the tabl hand the other to his guest and said to him monsieur i will conduct you to your room the man follow him as might have been observ from what has been said abov the hous was so arrang that in order to pass into the oratori where the alcov was situat or to get out of it it was necessari to travers the bishop bedroom at the moment when he was cross this apart madam magloir was put away the silverwar in the cupboard near the head of the bed this was her last care everi even befor she went to bed the bishop instal his guest in the alcov a fresh white bed had been prepar there the man set the candl down on a small tabl well said the bishop may you pass a good night to morrow morn befor you set out you shall drink a cup of warm milk from our cow thank monsieur labb said the man hard had he pronounc these word full of peac when all of a sudden and without transit he made a strang movement which would have frozen the two saint women with horror had they wit it even at this day it is difficult for us to explain what inspir him at that moment did he intend to convey a warn or to throw out a menac was he simpli obey a sort of instinct impuls which was obscur even to himself he turn abrupt to the old man fold his arm and bend upon his host a savag gaze he exclaim in a hoars voic ah realli you lodg me in your hous close to yourself like this he broke off and ad with a laugh in which there lurk someth monstrous have you realli reflect well how do you know that i have not been an assassin the bishop repli that is the concern of the good god then grave and move his lip like one who is pray or talk to himself he rais two finger of his right hand and bestow his benedict on the man who did not bow and without turn his head or look behind him he return to his bedroom when the alcov was in use a larg serg curtain drawn from wall to wall conceal the altar the bishop knelt befor this curtain as he pass and said a brief prayer a moment later he was in his garden walk medit contempl his heart and soul wholli absorb in those grand and mysteri thing which god show at night to the eye which remain open as for the man he was actual so fatigu that he did not even profit by the nice white sheet snuf out his candl with his nostril after the manner of convict he drop all dress as he was upon the bed where he immedi fell

clock tower of what had been their villag forgot them the boundari line of what had been their field forgot them after a few year resid in the galley jean valjean himself forgot them in that heart where there had been a wound there was a scar that is all onli onc dure all the time which he spent at toulon did he hear his sister mention this happen i think toward the end of the fourth year of his captiv i know not through what channel the news reach him some one who had known them in their own countri had seen his sister she was in pari she live in a poor street rear saint sulpic in the

what was told to jean valjean they talk to him about it for one day it was a moment a flash as though a window had sudden been open upon the destini of those thing whom he had love then all close again he heard noth more forev noth from them ever reach him again he never beheld them he never met them again and in the continu of this mourn histori they will not be met with ani more toward the end of this fourth year jean valjean turn to escap arriv his comrad assist him as is the custom in that sad place he escap he wander for two day in the field at liberti if be at liberti is to be hunt

miss at roll call the cannon were fire and at night the patrol found him hidden under the keel of a vessel in process of construct he resist the galley guard who seiz him escap and rebellion this case provid for by a special code was punish by an addit of five year two of them in the doubl chain thirteen year in the tenth year his turn came round again he again profit by it he succeed no better three year for this fresh attempt sixteen year final i think it was dure his thirteenth year he made a last attempt and onli succeed in get retaken at the end of four hour of absenc three year for those four hour nineteen year in octob 1815 he was releas he had enter there in 1796 for have broken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread room for a brief parenthesi this is the second time dure his studi on the penal question and damnat by law that the author of this book has come across the theft of a loaf of bread as the point of departur for the disast of a destini claud gueux had stolen a loaf jean valjean had stolen a loaf english statist prove the fact that four theft out of five in london have hunger for their immedi caus jean valjean had enter the galley sob and shudder he emerg impass he had enter in despair he emerg gloomi what had taken place in that soul chapter viith interior of despair let us tri to say it it is necessari that societi should look at these thing becaus it is itself which creat them he was as we have said an ignor man but he was not a fool the light of natur was ignit in him unhappi which also possess a clear of vision of it own augment the small amount of daylight which exist in this mind beneath the cudgel beneath the chain in the cell in hardship beneath the burn sun of the galley upon the plank bed of the convict he withdrew into his own conscious and medit he constitut himself the tribun he began by put himself on trial he recogn the fact that he was not an innoc man unjust punish he admit that he had commit an extrem and blameworthi act that that loaf of bread would probabl not have been refus to him had he ask for it that in ani case it would have been better to wait until he could get it through compass or through work that it is not an unanswer argument to say can one wait when one is hungri that in the first place it is veri rare for ani one to die of hunger liter and next that fortun or unfortun man is so constitut that he can suffer long and much both moral and physic without die that it is therefor necessari to have patienc that that would even have been better for those poor littl children that it had been an act of mad for him a miser unfortun wretch to take societi at larg violent by the collar and to imagin that one can escap from miseri through theft that that is in ani case a poor door through which to escap from miseri through which infami enter in short that he was in the wrong then he ask himself whether he had been the onli one in fault in his fatal histori whether it was not a serious thing that he a labor out of work that he an industri man should have lack bread and whether the fault onc commit and confess the chastis had not been feroci and disproport whether there had not been more abus on the part of the law in respect to the penalti than there had been on the part of the culprit in respect to his fault whether there had not been an excess of weight in one balanc of the scale in the one which contain expiat whether the over weight of the penalti was not equival to the annihil of the crime and did not result in revers the situat of replac the fault of the delinqu by the fault of the repress of convert the guilti man into the victim and the debtor into the creditor and of rang the law definit on the side of the man who had violat it whether this penalti complic by success aggrav for attempt at escap had not end in becom a sort of outrag perpetr by the stronger upon the feebler a crime of societi against the individu a crime which was be commit afresh everi day a crime which had last nineteen year he ask himself whether human societi could have the right to forc it member to suffer equal in one case for it own unreason lack of foresight and in the other case for it pitiless foresight and to seiz a poor man forev between a defect and an excess a default of work and an excess of punish whether it was not outrag for societi to treat thus precis those of it member who were the least well endow in the divis of good made by chanc and consequ the most deserv of consider these question put and answer he judg societi and condemn it he condemn it to his hatr he made it respons for the fate which he was suffer and he said to himself that it might be that one day he should not hesit to call it to account he declar to himself that there was no equilibrium between the harm which he had caus and the harm which was be done to him he final arriv at the conclus that his punish was not in truth unjust but that it most assur was iniquit anger may be both foolish and absurd one can be irrit wrong one is exasper onli when there is some show of right on one side at bottom jean valjean felt himself exasper and besid human societi had done him noth but harm he had never seen anyth of it save that angri face which it call justic and which it show to those whom it strike men had onli touch him to bruis him everi contact with them had been a blow never sinc his infanc sinc the day of his mother of his sister had he ever encount a friend word and a kind glanc from suffer to suffer he had gradual arriv at the convict that life is a war and that in this war he was the conquer he had no other weapon than his hate he resolv to whet it in the galley and to bear it away with him when he depart there was at toulon a school for the convict kept by the ignorantin friar where the most necessari branch were taught to those of the unfortun men who had a mind for them he was of the number who had a mind he went to school at the age of forti and learn to read to write to cipher he felt that to fortifi his intellig was to fortifi his hate in certain case educ and enlighten can serv to eke out evil this is a sad thing to say after have judg societi which had caus his unhappi he judg provid which had made societi and he condemn it also thus dure nineteen year of tortur and slaveri this soul mount and at the same time fell light enter it on one side and dark on the other jean valjean had not as we have seen an evil natur he was still good when he arriv at the galley he there condemn societi and felt that he was becom wick he there condemn provid and was conscious that he was becom impious it is difficult not to indulg in medit at this point doe human natur thus chang utter and from top to bottom can the man creat good by god be render wick by man can the soul be complet made over by fate and becom evil fate be evil can the heart becom misshapen and contract incur deform and infirm under the oppress of a disproportion unhappi as the vertebr column beneath too low a vault is there not in everi human soul was there not in the soul of jean valjean in particular a first spark a divin element incorrupt in this world immort in the other which good can develop fan ignit and make to glow with splendor and which evil can never wholli extinguish grave and obscur question to the last of which everi physiologist would probabl have respond no and that without hesit had he beheld at toulon dure the hour of repos which were for jean valjean hour of reveri this gloomi galley slave seat with fold arm upon the bar of some capstan with the end of his chain thrust into his pocket to prevent it drag serious silent and thought a pariah of the law which regard the man with wrath condemn by civil and regard heaven with sever certainlyand we make no attempt to dissimul the factth observ physiologist would have beheld an irremedi miseri he would perchanc have piti this sick man of the law make but he would not have even essay ani treatment he would have turn asid his gaze from the cavern of which he would have caught a glimps within this soul and like dant at the portal of hell he would have effac from this exist the word which the finger of god has nevertheless inscrib upon the brow of everi manhop was this state of his soul which we have attempt to analyz as perfect clear to jean valjean as we have tri to render it for those who read us did jean valjean distinct perceiv after their format and had he seen distinct dure the process of their format all the element of which his moral miseri was compos had this rough and unlett man gather a perfect clear percept of the success of idea through which he had by degre mount and descend to the lugubri aspect which had for so mani year form the inner horizon of his spirit was he conscious of all that pass within him and of all that was work there that is someth which we do not presum to state it is someth which we do not even believ there was too much ignor in jean valjean even after his misfortun to prevent much vagu from still linger there at time he did not right know himself what he felt jean valjean was in the shadow he suffer in the shadow he hate in the shadow one might have said that he hate in advanc of himself he dwelt habitu in this shadow feel his way like a blind man and a dreamer onli at interv there sudden came to him from without and from within an access of wrath a surcharg of suffer a livid and rapid flash which illumin his whole soul and caus to appear abrupt all around him in front behind amid the gleam of a fright light the hideous precipic and the sombr perspect of his destini the flash pass the night close in again and where was he he no longer knew the peculiar of pain of this natur in which that which is pitilessthat is to say that which is brutalizingpredomin is to transform a man littl by littl by a sort of stupid transfigur into a wild beast sometim into a feroci beast jean valjean success and obstin attempt at escap would alon suffic to prove this strang work of the law upon the human soul jean valjean would have renew these attempt utter useless and foolish as they were as often as the opportun had present itself without reflect for an instant on the result nor on the experi which he had alreadi gone through he escap impetu like the wolf who find his cage open instinct said to him flee reason would have said remain but in the presenc of so violent a temptat reason vanish noth remain but instinct the beast alon act when he was recaptur the fresh sever inflict on him onli serv to render him still more wild one detail which we must not omit is that he possess a physic strength which was not approach by a singl one of the denizen of the galley at work at pay out a cabl or wind up a capstan jean valjean was worth four men he sometim lift and sustain enorm weight on his back and when the occas demand it he replac that implement which is call a jack screw and was former call orgueil pride whenc we may remark in pass is deriv the name of the rue montorgueil near the hall fishmarket in pari his comrad had nicknam him jean the jack screw onc when they were repair the balconi of the town hall at

stop the moon had risen he sent his gaze into the distanc and shout for the last time littl gervai littl gervai littl gervai his shout die away in the mist without even awaken an echo he murmur yet onc more littl gervai but in a feebl and almost inarticul voic it was his last effort his leg gave way abrupt under him as though an invis power had sudden overwhelm him with the weight of his evil conscienc he fell exhaust on a larg stone his fist clench in his hair and his face on his knee and he cri i am a wretch then his heart burst and he began to cri it was the first time that he had wept in nineteen year when jean valjean left the bishop hous he was as we have seen quit thrown out of everyth that had been his thought hitherto he could not yield to the evid of what was go on within him he harden himself against the angel action and the gentl word of the old man you have promis me to becom an honest man i buy your soul i take it away from the spirit of pervers i give it to the good god this recur to his mind unceas to this celesti kind he oppos pride which is the fortress of evil within us he was indistinct conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatest assault and the most formid attack which had move him yet that his obduraci was final settl if he resist this clemenc that if he yield he should be oblig to renounc that hatr with which the action of other men had fill his soul through so mani year and which pleas him that this time it was necessari to conquer or to be conquer and that a struggl a coloss and final struggl had been begun between his vicious and the good of that man in the presenc of these light he proceed like a man who is intox as he walk thus with haggard eye did he have a distinct percept of what might result to him from his adventur at d did he understand all those mysteri murmur which warn or importun the spirit at certain moment of life did a voic whisper in his ear that he had just pass the solemn hour of his destini that there no longer remain a middl cours for him that if he were not henceforth the best of men he would be the worst that it behoov him now so to speak to mount higher than the bishop or fall lower than the convict that if he wish to becom good be must becom an angel that if he wish to remain evil he must becom a monster here again some question must be put which we have alreadi put to ourselv elsewher did he catch some shadow of all this in his thought in a confus way misfortun certain as we have said doe form the educ of the intellig nevertheless it is doubt whether jean valjean was in a condit to disentangl all that we have here indic if these idea occur to him he but caught glimps of rather than saw them and they onli succeed in throw him into an unutter and almost pain state of emot on emerg from that black and deform thing which is call the galley the bishop had hurt his soul as too vivid a light would have hurt his eye on emerg from the dark the futur life the possibl life which offer itself to him henceforth all pure and radiant fill him with tremor and anxieti he no longer knew where he realli was like an owl who should sudden see the sun rise the convict had been dazzl and blind as it were by virtu that which was certain that which he did not doubt was that he was no longer the same man that everyth about him was chang that it was no longer in his power to make it as though the bishop had not spoken to him and had not touch him in this state of mind he had encount littl gervai and had rob him of his forti sous whi he certain could not have explain it was this the last effect and the suprem effort as it were of the evil thought which he had brought away from the galleysa remnant of impuls a result of what is call in static acquir forc it was that and it was also perhap even less than that let us say it simpli it was not he who stole it was not the man it was the beast who by habit and instinct had simpli place his foot upon that money while the intellig was struggl amid so mani novel and hitherto unheard of thought beset it when intellig re awaken and beheld that action of the brute jean valjean recoil with anguish and utter a cri of terror illustr awaken 1b2 11 awaken it was becausestrang phenomenon and one which was possibl onli in the situat in which he found himselfin steal the money from that child he had done a thing of which he was no longer capabl howev that may be this last evil action had a decis effect on him it abrupt travers that chao which he bore in his mind and dispers it place on one side the thick obscur and on the other the light and act on his soul in the state in which it then was as certain chemic reagent act upon a troubl mixtur by precipit one element and clarifi the other first of all even befor examin himself and reflect all bewild like one who seek to save himself he tri to find the child in order to return his money to him then when he recogn the fact that this was imposs he halt in despair at the moment when he exclaim i am a wretch he had just perceiv what he was and he was alreadi separ from himself to such a degre that he seem to himself to be no longer anyth more than a phantom and as if he had there befor him in flesh and blood the hideous galley convict jean valjean cudgel in hand his blous on his hip his knapsack fill with stolen object on his back with his resolut and gloomi visag with his thought fill with abomin project excess of unhappi had as we have remark made him in some sort a visionari this then was in the natur of a vision he actual saw that jean valjean that sinist face befor him he had almost reach the point of ask himself who that man was and he was horrifi by him his brain was go through one of those violent and yet perfect calm moment in which reveri is so profound that it absorb realiti one no longer behold the object which one has befor one and one see as though apart from one self the figur which one has in one own mind thus he contempl himself so to speak face to face and at the same time athwart this hallucin he perceiv in a mysteri depth a sort of light which he at first took for a torch on scrutin this light which appear to his conscienc with more attent he recogn the fact that it possess a human form and that this torch was the bishop his conscienc weigh in turn these two men thus place befor itth bishop and jean valjean noth less than the first was requir to soften the second by one of those singular effect which are peculiar to this sort of ecstasi in proport as his reveri continu as the bishop grew great and resplend in his eye so did jean valjean grow less and vanish after a certain time he was no longer anyth more than a shade all at onc he disappear the bishop alon remain he fill the whole soul of this wretch man with a magnific radianc jean valjean wept for a long time he wept burn tear he sob with more weak than a woman with more fright than a child as he wept daylight penetr more and more clear into his soul an extraordinari light a light at onc ravish and terribl his past life his first fault his long expiat his extern brutish his intern hard his dismiss to liberti rejoic in manifold plan of vengeanc what had happen to him at the bishop the last thing that he had done that theft of forti sous from a child a crime all the more coward and all the more monstrous sinc it had come after the bishop pardonal this recur to his mind and appear clear to him but with a clear which he had never hitherto wit he examin his life and it seem horribl to him his soul and it seem fright to him in the meantim a gentl light rest over this life and this soul it seem to him that he beheld satan by the light of paradis how mani hour did he weep thus what did he do after he had wept

pace back and forth as though some one were walk in the room abov him he listen more attent and recogn m madelein step this struck him as strang usual there was no nois in m madelein chamber until he rose in the morn a moment later the cashier heard a nois which resembl that of a cupboard be open and then shut again then a piec of furnitur was disarrang then a paus ensu then the step began again the cashier sat up in bed quit awak now and stare and through his window pane he saw the reddish gleam of a light window reflect on the opposit wall from the direct of the ray it could onli come from the window of m madelein chamber the reflect waver as though it came rather from a fire which had been light than from a candl the shadow of the window frame was not shown which indic that the window was wide open the fact that this window was open in such cold weather was surpris the cashier fell asleep again an hour or two later he wake again the same step was still pass slowli and regular back and forth overhead the reflect was still visibl on the wall but now it was pale and peac like the reflect of a lamp or of a candl the window was still open this is what had taken place in m madelein room chapter iiia tempest in a skull the reader has no doubt alreadi divin that m madelein is no other than jean valjean we have alreadi gaze into the depth of this conscienc the moment has now come when we must take anoth look into it we do so not without emot and trepid there is noth more terribl in exist than this sort of contempl the eye of the spirit can nowher find more dazzl brillianc and more shadow than in man it can fix itself on no other thing which is more formid more complic more mysteri and more infinit there is a spectacl more grand than the sea it is heaven there is a spectacl more grand than heaven it is the inmost recess of the soul to make the poem of the human conscienc were it onli with refer to a singl man were it onli in connect with the basest of men would be to blend all epic into one superior and definit epic conscienc is the chao of chimera of lust and of temptat the furnac of dream the lair of idea of which we are asham it is the pandemonium of sophism it is the battlefield of the passion penetr at certain hour past the livid face of a human be who is engag in reflect and look behind gaze into that soul gaze into that obscur there beneath that extern silenc battl of giant like those record in homer are in progress skirmish of dragon and hydra and swarm of phantom as in milton visionari circl as in dant what a solemn thing is this infin which everi man bear within him and which he measur with despair against the capric of his brain and the action of his life alighieri one day met with a sinist look door befor which he hesit here is one befor us upon whose threshold we hesit let us enter nevertheless we have but littl to add to what the reader alreadi know of what had happen to jean valjean after the adventur with littl gervai from that moment forth he was as we have seen a total differ man what the bishop had wish to make of him that he carri out it was more than a transform it was a transfigur he succeed in disappear sold the bishop silver reserv onli the candlestick as a souvenir crept from town to town travers franc came to m sur m conceiv the idea which we have mention accomplish what we have relat succeed in render himself safe from seizur and inaccess and thenceforth establish at m sur m happi in feel his conscienc sadden by the past and the first half of his exist beli by the last he live in peac reassur and hope have henceforth onli two thoughtsto conceal his name and to sanctifi his life to escap men and to return to god these two thought were so close intertwin in his mind that they form but a singl one there both were equal absorb and imper and rule his slightest action in general they conspir to regul the conduct of his life they turn him toward the gloom they render him kind and simpl they counsel him to the same thing sometim howev they conflict in that case as the reader will rememb the man whom all the countri of m sur m call m madelein did not hesit to sacrific the first to the secondhi secur to his virtu thus in spite of all his reserv and all his prudenc he had preserv the bishop candlestick worn mourn for him summon and interrog all the littl savoyard who pass that way collect inform regard the famili at faveroll and save old fauchelev life despit the disquiet insinu of javert it seem as we have alreadi remark as though he thought follow the exampl of all those who have been wise holi and just that his first duti was not toward himself at the same time it must be confess noth just like this had yet present itself never had the two idea which govern the unhappi man whose suffer we are narrat engag in so serious a struggl he understood this confus but profound at the veri first word pronounc by javert when the latter enter his studi at the moment when that name which he had buri beneath so mani layer was so strang articul he was struck with stupor and as though intox with the sinist eccentr of his destini and through this stupor he felt that shudder which preced great shock he bent like an oak at the approach of a storm like a soldier at the approach of an assault he felt shadow fill with thunder and lightn descend upon his head as he listen to javert the first thought which occur to him was to go to run and denounc himself to take that champmathieu out of prison and place himself there this was as pain and as poignant as an incis in the live flesh then it pass away and he said to himself we will see we will see he repress this first generous instinct and recoil befor heroism it would be beauti no doubt after the bishop holi word after so mani year of repent and abneg in the midst of a penit admir begun if this man had not flinch for an instant even in the presenc of so terribl a conjectur but had continu to walk with the same step toward this yawn precipic at the bottom of which lay heaven that would have been beauti but it was not thus we must render an account of the thing which went on in this soul and we can onli tell what there was there he was carri away at first by the instinct of self preserv he ralli all his idea in hast stifl his emot took into consider javert presenc that great danger postpon all decis with the firm of terror shook off thought as to what he had to do and resum his calm as a warrior pick up his buckler he remain in this state dure the rest of the day a whirlwind within a profound tranquil without he took no preserv measur as they may be call everyth was still confus and jostl togeth in his brain his troubl was so great that he could not perceiv the form of a singl idea distinct and he could have told noth about himself except that he had receiv a great blow he repair to fantin bed of suffer as usual and prolong his visit through a kind instinct tell himself that he must behav thus and recommend her well to the sister in case he should be oblig to be absent himself he had a vagu feel that he might be oblig to go to arra and without have the least in the world made up his mind to this trip he said to himself that be as he was beyond the shadow of ani suspicion there could be noth out of the way in be a wit to what was to take place and he engag the tilburi from scaufflair in order to be prepar in ani event he dine with a good deal of appetit on return to his room he commune with himself he examin the situat and found it unpreced so unpreced that in the midst of his reveri he rose from his chair move by some inexplic impuls of anxieti and bolt his door he fear lest someth more should enter he was barricad himself against possibl a moment later he extinguish his light it embarrass him it seem to him as though he might be seen by whom ala that on which he desir to close the door had alreadi enter that which he desir to blind was stare him in the facehi conscienc his conscienc that is to say god nevertheless he delud himself at first he had a feel of secur and of solitud the bolt onc drawn he thought himself impregn the candl extinguish he felt himself invis then he took possess of himself he set his elbow on the tabl lean his head on his hand and began to medit in the dark where do i stand am not i dream what have i heard is it realli true that i have seen that javert and that he spoke to me in that manner who can that champmathieu be so he resembl me is it possibl when i reflect that yesterday i was so tranquil and so far from suspect anyth what was i do yesterday at this hour what is there in this incid what will the end be what is to be done this was the torment in which he found himself his brain had lost it power of retain idea they pass like wave and he clutch his brow in both hand to arrest them noth but anguish extric itself from this tumult which overwhelm his will and his reason and from which he sought to draw proof and resolut his head was burn he went to the window and threw it wide open there were no star in the sky he return and seat himself at the tabl the first hour pass in this manner gradual howev vagu outlin began to take form and to fix themselv in his medit and he was abl to catch a glimps with precis of the realitynot the whole situat but some of the detail he began by recogn the fact that critic and extraordinari as was this situat he was complet master of it this onli caus an increas of his stupor independ of the sever and religi aim which he had assign to his action all that he had made up to that day had been noth but a hole in which to buri his name that which he had alway fear most of all in his hour of self communion dure his sleepless night was to ever hear that name pronounc he had said to himself that that would be the end of all thing for him that on the day when that name made it reappear it would caus his new life to vanish from about him andwho knowsperhap even his new soul within him also he shudder at the veri thought that this was possibl assur if ani one had said to him at such moment that the hour would come when that name would ring in his ear when the hideous word jean valjean would sudden emerg from the dark and rise in front of him when that formid light capabl of dissip the mysteri in which he had envelop himself would sudden blaze forth abov his head and that that name would not menac him that that light would but produc an obscur more dens that this rent veil would but increas the mysteri that this earthquak would solidifi his edific that this prodigi incid would have no other result so far as he was concern if so it seem good to him than that of render his exist at onc clearer and more impenetr and that out of his confront with the phantom of jean valjean the good and worthi citizen monsieur madelein would emerg more honor more peac and more respect than everif ani one had told him that he would have toss his head and regard the word as those of a madman well all this was precis what had just come to pass all that accumul of imposs was a fact and god had permit these wild fanci to becom real thing his reveri continu to grow clearer he came more and more to an understand of his posit it seem to him that he had but just wake up from some inexplic dream and that he found himself slip down a decliv in the middl of the night erect shiver hold back all in vain on the veri brink of the abyss he distinct perceiv in the dark a stranger a man unknown to him whom destini had mistaken for him and whom she was thrust into the gulf in his stead in order that the gulf might close onc more it was necessari that some one himself or that other man should fall into it he had onli let thing take their cours the light becam complet and he acknowledg this to himself that his place was empti in the galley that do what he would it was still await him that the theft from littl gervai had led him back to it that this vacant place would await him and draw him on until he fill it that this was inevit and fatal and then he said to himself that at this moment he had a substitut that it appear that a certain champmathieu had that ill luck and that as regard himself be present in the galley in the person of that champmathieu present in societi under the name of m madelein he had noth more to fear provid that he did not prevent men from seal over the head of that champmathieu this stone of infami which like the stone of the sepulchr fall onc never to rise again all this was so strang and so violent that there sudden took place in him that indescrib movement which no man feel more than two or three time in the cours of his life a sort of convuls of the conscienc which stir up all that there is doubt in the heart which is compos of ironi of joy and of despair and which may be call an outburst of inward laughter he hastili relight his candl well what then he said to himself what am i afraid of what is there in all that for me to think about i am safe all is over i had but one part open door through which my past might invad my life and behold that door is wall up forev that javert who has been annoy me so long that terribl instinct which seem to have divin me which had divin megood god and which follow me everywher that fright hunt dog alway make a point at me is thrown off the scent engag elsewher absolut turn from the trail henceforth he is satisfi he will leav me in peac he has his jean valjean who know it is even probabl that he will wish to leav town and all this has been brought about without ani aid from me and i count for noth in it ah but where is the misfortun in this upon my honor peopl would think to see me that some catastroph had happen to me after all if it doe bring harm to some one that is not my fault in the least it is provid which has done it all it is becaus it wish it so to be evid have i the right to disarrang what it has arrang what do i ask now whi should i meddl it doe not concern me what i am not satisfi but what more do i want the goal to which i have aspir for so mani year the dream of my night the object of my prayer to heavensecurityi have now attain it is god who will it i can do noth against the will of god and whi doe god will it in order that i may continu what i have begun that i may do good that i may one day be a grand and encourag exampl that it may be said at last that a littl happi has been attach to the penanc which i have undergon and to that virtu to which i have return realli i do not understand whi i was afraid a littl while ago to enter the hous of that good cure and to ask his advic this is evid what he would have said to me it is settl let thing take their cours let the good god do as he like thus did he address himself in the depth of his own conscienc bend over what may be call his own abyss he rose from his chair and began to pace the room come said he let us think no more about it my resolv is taken but he felt no joy quit the revers one can no more prevent thought from recur to an idea than one can the sea from return to the shore the sailor call it the tide the guilti man call it remors god upheav the soul as he doe the ocean after the expir of a few moment do what he would he resum the gloomi dialogu in which it was he who spoke and he who listen say that which he would have prefer to ignor and listen to that which he would have prefer not to hear yield to that mysteri power which said to him think as it said to anoth condemn man two thousand year ago march on befor proceed further and in order to make ourselv fulli understood let us insist upon one necessari observ it is certain that peopl do talk to themselv there is no live be who has not done it it may even be said that the word is never a more magnific mysteri than when it goe from thought to conscienc within a man and when it return from conscienc to thought it is in this sens onli that the word so often employ in this chapter he said he exclaim must be understood one speak to one self talk to one self exclaim to one self without break the extern silenc there is a great tumult everyth about us talk except the mouth the realiti of the soul are none the less realiti becaus they are not visibl and palpabl so he ask himself where he stood he interrog himself upon that settl resolv he confess to himself that all that he had just arrang in his mind was monstrous that to let thing take their cours to let the good god do as he like was simpli horribl to allow this error of fate and of men to be carri out not to hinder it to lend himself to it through his silenc to do noth in short was to do everyth that this was hypocrit base in the last degre that it was a base coward sneak abject hideous crime for the first time in eight year the wretch man had just tast the bitter savor of an evil thought and of an evil action he spit it out with disgust he continu to question himself he ask himself sever what he had meant by this my object is attain he declar to himself that his life realli had an object but what object to conceal his name to deceiv the polic was it for so petti a thing that he had done all that he had done had he not anoth and a grand object which was the true oneto save not his person but his soul to becom honest and good onc more to be a just man was it not that abov all that alon which he had alway desir which the bishop had enjoin upon himto shut the door on his past but he was not shut it great god he was re open it by commit an infam action he was becom a thief onc more and the most odious of thiev he was rob anoth of his exist his life his peac his place in the sunshin he was becom an assassin he was murder moral murder a wretch man he was inflict on him that fright live death that death beneath the open sky which is call the galley on the other hand to surrend himself to save that man struck down with so melancholi an error to resum his own name to becom onc more out of duti the convict jean valjean that was in truth to achiev his resurrect and to close forev that hell whenc he had just emerg to fall back there in appear was to escap from it in realiti this must be done he had done noth if he did not do all this his whole life was useless all his penit was wast there was no longer ani need of say what is the use he felt that the bishop was there that the bishop was present all the more becaus he was dead that the bishop was gaze fix at him that henceforth mayor madelein with all his virtu would be abomin to him and that the convict jean valjean would be pure and admir in his sight that men beheld his mask but that the bishop saw his face that men saw his life but that the bishop beheld his conscienc so he must go to arra deliv the fals jean valjean and denounc the real one ala that was the greatest of sacrific the most poignant of victori the last step to take but it must be done sad fate he would enter into sanctiti onli in the eye of god when he return to infami in the eye of men well said he let us decid upon this let us do our duti let us save this man he utter these word aloud without perceiv that he was speak aloud he took his book verifi them and put them in order he flung in the fire a bundl of bill which he had against petti and embarrass tradesmen he wrote and seal a letter and on the envelop it might have been read had there been ani one in his chamber at the moment to monsieur laffitt banker rue dartoi pari he drew from his secretari a pocket book which contain sever bank note and the passport of which he had made use that same year when he went to the elect ani one who had seen him dure the execut of these various act into which there enter such grave thought would have had no suspicion of what was go on within him onli occasion did his lip move at other time he rais his head and fix his gaze upon some point of the wall as though there exist at that point someth which he wish to elucid or interrog when he had finish the letter to m laffitt he put it into his pocket togeth with the pocket book and began his walk onc more his reveri had not swerv from it cours he continu to see his duti clear written in lumin letter which flame befor his eye and chang it place as he alter the direct of his glanc go tell your name denounc yourself in the same way he beheld as though they had pass befor him in visibl form the two idea which had up to that time form the doubl rule of his soulth conceal of his name the sanctif of his life for the first time they appear to him as absolut distinct and he perceiv the distanc which separ them he recogn the fact that one of these idea was necessarili good while the other might becom bad that the first was self devot and that the other was person that the one said my neighbor and that the other said myself that one eman from the light and the other from dark they were antagonist he saw them in conflict in proport as he medit they grew befor the eye of his spirit they had now attain coloss statur and it seem to him that he beheld within himself in that infin of which we were recent speak in the midst of the dark and the light a goddess and a giant contend he was fill with terror but it seem to him that the good thought was get the upper hand he felt that he was on the brink of the second decis crisi of his conscienc and of his destini that the bishop had mark the first phase of his new life and that champmathieu mark the second after the grand crisi the grand test but the fever allay for an instant gradual resum possess of him a thousand thought travers his mind but they continu to fortifi him in his resolut one moment he said to himself that he was perhap take the matter too keen that after all this champmathieu was not interest and that he had actual been guilti of theft he answer himself if this man has inde stolen a few appl that mean a month in prison it is a long way from that to the galley and who know did he steal has it been prove the name of jean valjean overwhelm him and seem to dispens with proof do not the attorney for the crown alway proceed in this manner he is suppos to be a thief becaus he is known to be a convict in anoth instant the thought had occur to him that when he denounc himself the heroism of his deed might perhap be taken into consider and his honest life for the last seven year and what he had done for the district and that they would have merci on him but this supposit vanish veri quick and he smile bitter as he rememb that the theft of the forti sous from littl gervai put him in the posit of a man guilti of a second offenc after convict that this affair would certain come up and accord to the precis term of the law would render him liabl to penal servitud for life he turn asid from all illus detach himself more and more from earth and sought strength and consol elsewher he told himself that he must do his duti that perhap he should not be more unhappi after do his duti than after have avoid it that if he allow thing to take their own cours if he remain at m sur m his consider his good name his good work the defer and vener paid to him his chariti his wealth his popular his virtu would be season with a crime and what would be the tast of all these holi thing when bound up with this hideous thing while if he accomplish his sacrific a celesti idea would be mingl with the galley the post the iron necklet the green cap unceas toil and pitiless shame at length he told himself that it must be so that his destini was thus allot that he had not author to alter the arrang made on high that in ani case he must make his choic virtu without and abomin within or holi within and infami without the stir up of these lugubri idea did not caus his courag to fail but his brain grow weari he began to think of other thing of indiffer matter in spite of himself the vein in his templ throb violent he still pace to and fro midnight sound first from the parish church then from the town hall he count the twelv stroke of the two clock and compar the sound of the two bell he recal in this connect the fact that a few day previous he had seen in an ironmong shop an ancient clock for sale upon which was written the name antoin albin de romainvill he was cold he light a small fire it did not occur to him to close the window in the meantim he had relaps into his stupor he was oblig to make a toler vigor effort to recal what had been the subject of his thought befor midnight had struck he final succeed in do this ah yes he said to himself i had resolv to inform against myself and then all of a sudden he thought of fantin hold said he and what about that poor woman here a fresh crisi declar itself fantin by appear thus abrupt in his reveri produc the effect of an unexpect ray of light it seem to him as though everyth about him were undergo a chang of aspect he exclaim ah but i have hitherto consid no one but myself it is proper for me to hold my tongu or to denounc myself to conceal my person or to save my soul to be a despic and respect magistr or an infam and vener convict it is i it is alway i and noth but i but good god all this is egot these are divers form of egot but it is egot all the same what if i were to think a littl about other the highest holi is to think of other come let us examin the matter the i except the i effac the i forgotten what would be the result of all this what if i denounc myself i am arrest this champmathieu is releas i am put back in the galley that is welland what then what is go on here ah here is a countri a town here are factori an

what will take place if i denounc myself if i do not denounc myself come let us see how it will be if i do not denounc myself after put this question to himself he paus he seem to undergo a momentari hesit and trepid but it did not last long and he answer himself calm well this man is go to the galley it is true but what the deuc he has stolen there is no use in my say that he has not been guilti of theft for he has i remain here i go on in ten year i shall have made ten million i scatter them over the countri i have noth of my own what is that to me it is not for myself that i am do it the

incomplet if we were to omit it it is the gloomi adventur of an ail soul here it is on the envelop we find this line inscrib the dream i had that night i was in a plain a vast gloomi plain where there was no grass it did not seem to me to be daylight nor yet night i was walk with my brother the brother of my childish year the brother of whom i must say i never think and whom i now hard rememb we were convers and we met some passer by we were talk of a neighbor of our in former day who had alway work with her window open from the time when she came to live on the street as we talk we felt cold becaus of that open window there were no tree in the plain we saw a man pass close to us he was entir nude of the hue of ash and mount on a hors which was earth color the man had no hair we could see his skull and the vein on it in his hand he held a switch which was as suppl as a vine shoot and as heavi as iron this horseman pass and said noth to us my brother said to me let us take to the hollow road there exist a hollow way wherein one saw neither a singl shrub nor a spear of moss everyth was dirt color even the sky after proceed a few pace i receiv no repli when i spoke i perceiv that my

enter the garden the garden was desert behind the first tree i found a man stand upright i said to this man what garden is this where am i the man did not answer i stroll into the villag and perceiv that it was a town all the street were desert all the door were open not a singl live be was pass in the street walk through the chamber or stroll in the garden but behind each angl of the wall behind each door behind each tree stood a silent man onli one was to be seen at a time these men watch me pass i left the town and began to rambl about the field after the laps of some time i turn back and saw a great crowd come up behind me i recogn all the men whom i had seen in that town they had strang head they did not seem to be in a hurri yet they walk faster than i did they made no nois as they walk in an instant this crowd had overtaken and surround me the face of these men were earthen in hue then the first one whom i had seen and question on enter the town said to me whither are you go do you not know that you have been dead this long time i open my mouth to repli and i perceiv that there was no one near me he woke he was ici cold a wind which was chill like the breez of dawn was rattl the leav of the window which had been left open on their hing the fire was out the candl was near it end it was still black night he rose he went to the window there were no star in the sky even yet from his window the yard of the hous and the street were visibl a sharp harsh nois which made him drop his eye resound from the earth below him he perceiv two red star whose ray lengthen and shorten in a singular manner through the dark as his thought were still half immers in the mist of sleep hold said he there are no star in the sky they are on earth now but this confus vanish a second sound similar to the first rous him thorough he look and recogn the fact that these two star were the lantern of a carriag by the light which they cast he was abl to distinguish the form of this vehicl it was a tilburi har to a small white hors the nois which he had heard was the trampl of the hors hoof on the pavement what vehicl is this he said to himself who is come here so earli in the morn at that moment there came a light tap on the door of his chamber he shudder from head to foot and cri in a terribl voic who is there some one said i monsieur le mair he recogn the voic of the old woman who was his portress well he repli what is it monsieur le mair it is just five oclock in the morn what is that to me the cabriolet is here monsieur le mair what cabriolet the tilburi what tilburi did not monsieur le mair order a tilburi no said he the coachman say that he has come for monsieur le mair what coachman m scaufflair coachman m scaufflair that name sent a shudder over him as though a flash of lightn had pass in front of his face ah yes he resum m scaufflair if the old woman could have seen him at that moment she would have been frighten a toler long silenc ensu he examin the flame of the candl with a stupid air and from around the wick he took some of the burn wax which he roll between his finger the old woman wait for him she even ventur to uplift her voic onc more what am i to say monsieur le mair say that it is well and that i am come down chapter vhindranc the post servic from arra to m sur m was still oper at this period by small mail wagon of the time of the empir these mail wagon were two wheel cabriolet upholst insid with fawn color leather hung on spring and have but two seat one for the postboy the other for the travel the wheel were arm with those long offens axl which keep other vehicl at a distanc and which may still be seen on the road in germani the despatch box an immens oblong coffer was place behind the vehicl and form a part of it this coffer was paint black and the cabriolet yellow these vehicl which have no counterpart nowaday had someth distort and hunchback about them and when one saw them pass in the distanc and climb up some road to the horizon they resembl the insect which are call i think termit and which though with but littl corselet drag a great train behind them but they travel at a veri rapid rate the post wagon which set out from arra at one oclock everi night after the mail from pari had pass arriv at m sur m a littl befor five oclock in the morn that night the wagon which was descend to m sur m by the hesdin road collid at the corner of a street just as it was enter the town with a littl tilburi har to a white hors which was go in the opposit direct and in which there was but one person a man envelop in a mantl the wheel of the tilburi receiv quit a violent shock the postman shout to the man to stop but the travel paid no heed and pursu his road at full gallop that man is in a devilish hurri said the postman the man thus hasten on was the one whom we have just seen struggl in convuls which are certain deserv of piti whither was he go he could not have told whi was he hasten he did not know he was drive at random straight ahead whither to arra no doubt but he might have been go elsewher as well at time he was conscious of it and he shudder he plung into the night as into a gulf someth urg him forward someth drew him on no one could have told what was take place within him everi one will understand it what man is there who has not enter at least onc in his life into that obscur cavern of the unknown howev he had resolv on noth decid noth form no plan done noth none of the action of his conscienc had been decis he was more than ever as he had been at the first moment whi was he go to arra he repeat what he had alreadi said to himself when he had hire scaufflair cabriolet that whatev the result was to be there was no reason whi he should not see with his own eye and judg of matter for himself that this was even prudent that he must know what took place that no decis could be arriv at without have observ and scrutin that one made mountain out of everyth from a distanc that at ani rate when he should have seen that champmathieu some wretch his conscienc would probabl be great reliev to allow him to go to the galley in his stead that javert would inde be there and that brevet that chenildieu that cochepaill old convict who had known him but they certain would not recogn himbah what an idea that javert was a hundr leagu from suspect the truth that all conjectur and all supposit were fix on champmathieu and that there is noth so headstrong as supposit and conjectur that accord there was no danger that it was no doubt a dark moment but that he should emerg from it that after all he held his destini howev bad it might be in his own hand that he was master of it he clung to this thought at bottom to tell the whole truth he would have prefer not to go to arra nevertheless he was go thither as he medit he whip up his hors which was proceed at that fine regular and even trot which accomplish two leagu and a half an hour in proport as the cabriolet advanc he felt someth within him draw back at daybreak he was in the open countri the town of m sur m lay far behind him he watch the horizon grow white he stare at all the chilli figur of a winter dawn as they pass befor his eye but without see them the morn has it spectr as well as the even he did not see them but without his be awar of it and by mean of a sort of penetr which was almost physic these black silhouett of tree and of hill ad some gloomi and sinist qualiti to the violent state of his soul each time that he pass one of those isol dwell which sometim border on the highway he said to himself and yet there are peopl there within who are sleep the trot of the hors the bell on the har the wheel on the road produc a gentl monoton nois these thing are charm when one is joyous and lugubri when one is sad it was broad daylight when he arriv at hesdin he halt in front of the inn to allow the hors a breath spell and to have him given some oat the hors belong as scaufflair had said to that small race of the boulonnai which has too much head too much belli and not enough neck and shoulder but which has a broad chest a larg crupper thin fine leg and solid hoofsa home but a robust and healthi race the excel beast had travel five leagu in two hour and had not a drop of sweat on his loin he did not get out of the tilburi the stableman who brought the oat sudden bent down and examin the left wheel are you go far in this condit said the man he repli with an air of not have rous himself from his reveri whi have you come from a great distanc went on the man five leagu ah whi do you say ah the man bent down onc more was silent for a moment with his eye fix on the wheel then he rose erect and said becaus though this wheel has travel five leagu it certain will not travel anoth quarter of a leagu he sprang out of the tilburi what is that you say my friend i say that it is a miracl that you should have travel five leagu without you and your hors roll into some ditch on the highway just see here the wheel realli had suffer serious damag the shock administ by the mail wagon had split two spoke and strain the hub so that the nut no longer held firm my friend he said to the stableman is there a wheelwright here certain sir do me the servic to go and fetch him he is onli a step from here hey master bourgaillard master bourgaillard the wheelwright was stand on his own

the stableman and the wheelwright repli in concert with a toss of the head no he felt an immens joy it was evid that provid was interven that it was it who had broken the wheel of the tilburi and who was stop him on the road he had not yield to this sort of first summon he had just made everi possibl effort to continu the journey he had loyal and scrupul exhaust all mean he had been deter neither by the season nor fatigu nor by the expens he had noth with which to reproach himself if he went no further that was no fault of his it did not concern him further it was no longer his fault it was not the act of his own conscienc but the act of provid he breath again he breath freeli and to the full extent of his lung for the first time sinc javert visit it seem to him that the hand of iron which had held his heart in it grasp for the last twenti hour had just releas him it seem to him that god was for him now and was manifest himself he said himself that he had done all he could and that now he had noth to do but retrac his step quiet if his convers with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber of the inn it would have had no wit no one would have heard him thing would have rest there and it is probabl that we should not have had to relat ani of the occurr which the reader is about to perus but this convers had taken place in the street ani colloquy in the street inevit attract a crowd there are alway peopl who ask noth better than to becom spectat while he was question the wheelwright some peopl who were pass back and forth halt around them after listen for a few minut a young lad to whom no one had paid ani heed detach himself from the group and ran off at the moment when the travel after the inward deliber which we have just describ resolv to retrac his step this child return he was accompani by an old woman monsieur said the woman my boy tell me that you wish to hire a cabriolet these simpl word utter by an old woman led by a child made the perspir

morn he watch the tree the thatch roof the till field pass by and the way in which the landscap broken at everi turn of the road vanish this is a sort of contempl which sometim suffic to the soul and almost reliev it from thought what is more melancholi and more profound than to see a thousand object for the first and the last time to travel is to be born and to die at everi instant perhap in the vaguest region of his mind he did make comparison between the shift horizon and our human exist all the thing of life are perpetu flee befor us the dark and bright interv are intermingl after a dazzl

establish the fact that the theft of the appl had not been circumstanti prove his client whom he in his charact of counsel persist in call champmathieu had not been seen scale that wall nor break that branch by ani one he had been taken with that branch which the lawyer prefer to call a bough in his possess but he said that he had found it broken off and lie on the ground and had pick it up where was there ani proof to the contrari no doubt that branch had been broken off and conceal after the scale of the wall then thrown away by the alarm maraud there was no doubt that there had been a thief in the case but what proof was there that that thief had been champmathieu one thing onli his charact as an ex convict the lawyer did not deni that that charact appear to be unhappili well attest the

eighteenth of june 1815 let us turn backthat is one of the stori teller rightsand put ourselv onc more in the year 1815 and even a littl earlier than the epoch when the action narrat in the first part of this book took place if it had not rain in the night between the 17th and the 18th of june 1815 the fate of europ would have been differ a few drop of water more or less decid the downfal of napoleon all that provid requir in order to make waterloo the end of austerlitz was a littl more rain and a cloud travers the sky out of season suffic to make a world crumbl the battl of waterloo could not be begun until half past eleven oclock and that gave blucher time to come up whi becaus the ground was wet the artilleri had to wait until it becam a littl firmer befor they could manoeuvr napoleon was an artilleri offic and felt the effect of this the foundat of this wonder captain was the man who in the report to the directori on aboukir said such a one of our ball kill six men all his plan of battl were arrang for projectil the key to his victori was to make the artilleri converg on one point he treat the strategi of the hostil general like a citadel and made a breach in it he overwhelm the weak point with grape shot he join and dissolv battl with cannon there was someth of the sharpshoot in his genius to beat in squar to pulver regiment to break line to crush and dispers massesfor him everyth lay in this to strike strike strike incessantlyand he intrust this task to the cannon ball a redoubt method and one which unit with genius render this gloomi athlet of the pugil of war invinc for the space of fifteen year on the 18th of june 1815 he reli all the more on his artilleri becaus he had number on his side wellington had onli one hundr and fifti nine mouth of fire napoleon had two hundr and forti suppos the soil dri and the artilleri capabl of move the action would have begun at six oclock in the morn the battl would have been won and end at two oclock three hour befor the chang of fortun in favor of the prussian what amount of blame attach to napoleon for the loss of this battl is the shipwreck due to the pilot was it the evid physic declin of napoleon that complic this epoch by an inward diminut of forc had the twenti year of war worn out the blade as it had worn the scabbard the soul as well as the bodi did the veteran make himself disastr felt in the leader in a word was this genius as mani historian of note have thought suffer from an eclips did he go into a frenzi in order to disguis his weaken power from himself did he begin to waver under the delus of a breath of adventur had he becomea grave matter in a generalunconsci of peril is there an age in this class of materi great men who may be call the giant of action when genius grow short sight old age has no hold on the genius of the ideal for the dant and michael angelo to grow old is to grow in great is it to grow less for the hannib and the bonapart had napoleon lost the direct sens of victori had he reach the point where he could no longer recogn the reef could no longer divin the snare no longer discern the crumbl brink of abyss had he lost his power of scent out catastroph he who had in former day known all the road to triumph and who from the summit of his chariot of lightn point them out with a sovereign finger had he now reach that state of sinist amaz when he could lead his tumultu legion har to it to the precipic was he seiz at the age of forti six with a suprem mad was that titan chariot of destini no longer anyth more than an immens dare devil we do not think so his plan of battl was by the confess of all a masterpiec to go straight to the centr of the alli line to make a breach in the enemi to cut them in two to drive the british half back on hal and the prussian half on tongr to make two shatter fragment of wellington and blucher to carri mont saint jean to seiz brussel to hurl the german into the rhine and the englishman into the sea

are of the devil composit possibl befor proceed further it will be to the purpos to narrat in some detail a singular occurr which took place at about the same epoch in montfermeil and which is not lack in coincid with certain conjectur of the indict there exist in the region of montfermeil a veri ancient superstit which is all the more curious and all the more precious becaus a popular superstit in the vicin of pari is like an alo in siberia we are among those who respect everyth which is in the natur of a rare plant here then is the superstit of montfermeil it is thought that the devil from time immemori has select the forest as a hide place for his treasur goodwiv affirm that it is no rariti to encount at nightfal in seclud nook of the forest a black man with the air of a carter or a wood chopper wear wooden shoe clad in trouser and a blous of linen and recogniz by the fact that instead of a cap or hat he has two immens horn on his head this ought in fact to render him recogniz this man is habitu engag in dig a hole there are three way of profit by such an encount the first is to approach the man and speak to him then it is seen that the man is simpli a peasant that he appear black becaus it is nightfal that he is not dig ani hole whatev but is cut grass for his cow and that what had been taken for horn is noth but a dung fork which he is carri on his back and whose teeth thank to the perspect of even seem to spring from his head the man return home and die within the week the second way is to watch him to wait until he has dug his hole until he has fill it and has gone away then to run with great speed to the trench to open it onc more and to seiz the treasur which the black man has necessarili place there in this case one die within the month final the last method is not to speak to the black man not to look at him and to flee at the best speed of one leg one then die within the year as all three method are attend with their special inconveni the second which at all event present some advantag among other that of possess a treasur if onli for a month is the one most general adopt so bold men who are tempt by everi chanc have quit frequent as we are assur open the hole excav by the black man and tri to rob the devil the success of the oper appear to be but moder at least if the tradit is to be believ and in particular the two enigmat line

at the bottom of the hole when he lay his hand on the treasur what doe he find what is the devil treasur a sou sometim a crown piec a stone a skeleton a bleed bodi sometim a spectr fold in four like a

all that one possess and as for the powder in the horn it possess the properti of make your gun burst in your face now a veri short time after the epoch when it seem to the prosecut attorney that the liber convict jean valjean dure his flight of sever day had been prowl around montfermeil it was remark in that villag that a certain old road labor name boulatruell had peculiar way in the forest peopl thereabout thought they knew that this boulatruell had been in the galley he was subject to certain polic supervis and as he could find work nowher the administr employ him at reduc rate as a

and trembl and smile in the presenc of the gendarmesprob affili to robber band they said suspect of lie in ambush at verg of cops at nightfal the onli thing in his favor was that he was a drunkard this is what peopl thought they had notic of late boulatruell had taken to quit his task of stone break and care of the road at a veri earli hour and to betak himself to the forest with his pickax he

then they recogn boulatruell and were not in the least reassur therebi these encount seem to caus boulatruell a live displeasur it was evid that he sought to hide and that there was some mysteri in

palpabl sort than the devil bank bill and that the road mender had half discov the secret the most puzzl were the school master and thenardi the proprietor of the tavern who was everybodi friend and had not disdain to alli himself with boulatruell he has been in the galley said thenardi eh good god no one know who has been there or will be there one even the schoolmast affirm that in former time the law would have institut an inquiri as to what boulatruell did in the forest and that the latter would have been forc to speak and that he would have been put to the tortur in case of need and that boulatruell would not have resist the water test for exampl let us put him to the wine test said thenardi they made an effort and got the old road mender to drink boulatruell drank an enorm amount but said veri littl he combin with admir art and in master proport the thirst of a gormand with the discret of a judg nevertheless by dint of return to the charg and of compar and put togeth the few obscur word which he did allow to escap him this is what thenardi and the schoolmast imagin that they had made out one morn when boulatruell was on his way to his work at daybreak he had been surpris to see at a nook of the forest in the underbrush a shovel and a pickax conceal as one might say howev he might have suppos that they were probabl the shovel and pick of father six four the water carrier and would have thought no more about it but on the even of that day he saw without be seen himself as he was hidden by a larg tree a person who did not belong in those part and whom he boulatruell knew well direct his step toward the densest part of the wood translat by thenardi a comrad of the galley boulatruell obstin refus to reveal his name this person carri a packagesometh squar like a larg box or a small trunk surpris on the part of boulatruell howev it was onli after the expir of seven or eight minut that the idea of follow that person had occur to him but it was too late the person was alreadi in the thicket night had descend and boulatruell had not been abl to catch up with him then he had adopt the cours of watch for him at the edg of the wood it was moonlight two or three hour later boulatruell had seen this person emerg from the brushwood carri no longer the coffer but a shovel and pick boulatruell had allow the person to pass and had not dream of accost him becaus he said to himself that the other man was three time as strong as he was and arm with a pickax and that he would probabl knock him over the head on recogn him and on perceiv that he was recogn touch effus of two old comrad on meet again but the shovel and pick had serv as a ray of light to boulatruell he had hasten to the thicket in the morn and had found neither shovel nor pick from this he had drawn the infer that this person onc in the forest had dug a hole with his pick buri the coffer and reclos the hole with his shovel now the coffer was too small to contain a bodi therefor it contain money henc his research boulatruell had explor sound search the entir forest and the thicket and had dug wherev the earth appear to him to have been recent turn up in vain he had ferret out noth no one in montfermeil thought ani more about it there were onli a few brave gossip who said you may be certain that the mender on the gagni road did not take all that troubl for noth he was sure

a post chais doe not pass through the rue des post onc in ten year in the thirteenth centuri this rue des post was inhabit by potter and it real name is rue des pot the moon cast a livid light into this open space jean valjean went into ambush in a doorway calcul that if the men were still follow him he could not fail to get a good look at them as they travers this illumin space in point of fact three minut had not elaps when the men made their appear there were four of them now all were tall dress in long brown coat with round hat and huge cudgel in their hand their great statur and their vast fist render them no less alarm than did their sinist stride through the dark one would have pronounc them four spectr disguis as bourgeoi they halt in the middl of the space and form a group like men in consult they had an air of indecis the one who appear to be their leader turn round and point hastili with his right hand in the direct which jean valjean had taken anoth seem to indic the contrari direct with consider obstinaci at the moment when the first man wheel round the moon fell full in his face jean valjean recogn javert perfect chapter iiit is lucki that the pont dausterlitz bear carriag uncertainti was at an end for jean valjean fortun it still last for the men he took advantag of their hesit it was time lost for them but gain for him he slip from under the gate where he had conceal himself and went down the rue des post toward the region of the jardin des plant cosett was begin to be tire he took her in his arm and carri her there were no passer by and the street lantern had not been light on account of there be a moon he redoubl his pace in a few stride he had reach the goblet potteri on the front of which the moonlight render distinct legibl the ancient

you are carri a child who can walk pay for two he paid vex that his passag should have arous remark everi flight should be an impercept slip away a heavi cart was cross the sein at the same time as himself and on it way like him to the right bank this was of use to him he could travers the bridg in the shadow of the cart toward the middl of the bridg cosett whose feet were benumb want to walk he set her on the ground and took her hand again the bridg onc cross he perceiv some timber yard on his right he direct his cours thither in order to reach them it was necessari to risk himself in a toler larg unshelt and illumin space he did not hesit those who were on his track had evid lost the scent and jean valjean believ himself to be out of danger hunt yes follow no a littl street the rue du chemin vert saint antoin open out between two timber yard enclos in wall this street was dark and narrow and seem made expressli for him befor enter it he cast a glanc behind him from the point where he stood he could see the whole extent of the pont dausterlitz four shadow were just enter on the bridg these shadow had their back turn to the jardin des plant and were on their way to the right bank these four shadow were the four men jean valjean shudder like the wild beast which is recaptur one hope remain to him it was that the men had not perhap step on the bridg and had not caught sight of him while he was cross the larg illumin space hold cosett by the hand in that case by plung into the littl street befor him he might escap if he could reach the timber yard the marsh the market garden the uninhabit ground which was not built upon it seem to him that he might commit himself to that silent littl street he enter it chapter iiito wit the plan of pari in 1727 three hundr pace further on he arriv at a point where the street fork it separ into two street which ran in a slant line one to the right and the other to the left jean valjean had befor him what resembl the two branch of a y which should he choos he did not hesit but took the one on the right whi becaus that to the left ran toward a suburb that is to say toward inhabit region and the right branch toward the open countri that is to say toward desert region howev they no longer walk veri fast cosett pace retard jean valjean he took her up and carri her again cosett laid her head on the shoulder of the good man and said not a word he turn round from time to time and look behind him he took care to keep alway on the dark side of the street the street was straight in his rear the first two or three time that he turn round he saw noth the silenc was profound and he continu his march somewhat reassur all at onc on turn round he thought he perceiv in the portion of the street which he had just pass through far off in the obscur someth which was move he rush forward precipit rather than walk hope to find some side street to make his escap through it and thus to break his scent onc more he arriv at a wall this wall howev did not absolut prevent further progress it was a wall which border a transvers street in which the one he had taken end here again he was oblig to come to a decis should he go to the right or to the left he glanc to the right the fragmentari lane was prolong between build which were either shed or barn then end at a blind alley the extrem of the cul de sac was distinct visiblea lofti white wall he glanc to the left on that side the lane was open and about two hundr pace further on ran into a street of which it was the affluent on that side lay safeti at the moment when jean valjean was medit a turn to the left in an effort to reach the street which he saw at the end of the lane he perceiv a sort of motionless black statu at the corner of the lane and the street toward which he was on the point of direct his step it was some one a man who had evid just been post there and who was bar the passag and wait jean valjean recoil the point of pari where jean valjean found himself situat between the faubourg saint antoin and la rape is one of those which recent improv have transform from top to bottomresult in disfigur accord to some and in a transfigur accord to other the market garden the timber yard and the old build have been effac to day there are brand new wide street arena circus hippodrom railway station and a prison maza there progress as the reader

with suffici clear in the plan of 1727 publish at pari by deni thierri rue saint jacqu opposit the rue du platr and at lyon by jean girin rue mercier at the sign of prudenc petit picpus had as we have just mention a y of street form by the rue du chemin vert saint antoin which spread out in two branch take on the left the name of littl picpus street and on the right the name of the rue polonceau the two limb of the y were connect at the apex as by a bar this bar was call rue droit mur the rue polonceau end there rue petit picpus pass on and ascend toward the lenoir market a person come from the sein reach the extrem of the rue polonceau and had on his right the rue droit mur turn abrupt at a right angl in front of him the wall of that street and on his right a truncat prolong of the rue droit mur which had no issu and was call the cul de sac genrot it was here that jean valjean stood as we have just said on catch sight of that black silhouett stand on guard at the angl of the rue droit mur and the rue petit picpus he recoil there could be no doubt of it that phantom was lie in wait for him what was he to do the time for retreat was pass that which he had perceiv in movement an instant befor in the distant dark was javert and his squad without a doubt javert was probabl alreadi at the commenc of the street at whose end jean valjean stood javert to all appear was acquaint with this littl labyrinth and had taken his precaut by send one of his men to guard the exit these surmis which so close resembl proof whirl sudden like a hand of dust caught up by an unexpect gust of wind through jean valjean mourn brain he examin the cul de sac genrot there he was cut off he examin the rue petit picpus there stood a sentinel he saw that black form stand out in relief against the white pavement illumin by the moon to advanc was to fall into this man hand to retreat was to fling himself into javert arm jean valjean felt himself caught as in a net which was slowli contract he gaze heavenward in despair chapter ivth grope of flight in order to understand what follow it is requisit to form an exact idea of the droit mur lane and in particular of the angl which one leav on the left when one emerg from the rue polonceau into this lane droit mur lane was almost entir border on the right as far as the rue petit picpus by hous of mean aspect on the left by a solitari build of sever outlin compos of numer part which grew gradual higher by a stori or two as they approach the rue petit picpus side so that this build which was veri lofti on the rue petit picpus side was toler low on the side adjoin the rue polonceau there at the angl of which we have spoken it descend to such a degre that it consist of mere a wall this wall did not abut direct on the street it form a deepli retreat nich conceal by it two corner from two observ who might have been one in the rue polonceau the other in the rue droit mur begin with these angl of the nich the wall extend along the rue polonceau as far as a hous which bore the number 49 and along the rue droit mur where the fragment was much shorter as far as the gloomi build which we have mention and whose gabl it intersect thus form anoth retreat angl in the street this gabl was sombr of aspect onli one window was visibl or to speak more correct two shutter cover with a sheet of zinc and kept constant close the state of the place of which we are here give a descript is rigor exact and will certain awaken a veri precis memori in the mind of old inhabit of the quarter the nich was entir fill by a thing which resembl a coloss and wretch door it was a vast formless assemblag of perpendicular plank the upper one be broader than the lower bound togeth by long transvers strip of iron at one side there was a carriag gate of the ordinari dimens and which had evid not been cut more than fifti year previous a linden tree show it crest abov the nich and the wall was cover with ivi on the side of the rue polonceau in the immin peril in which jean valjean found himself this sombr build had about it a solitari and uninhabit look which tempt him he ran his eye rapid over it he said to himself that if he could contriv to get insid it he might save himself first he conceiv an idea then a hope in the central portion of the front of this build on the rue droit mur side there were at all the window of the differ stori ancient cistern pipe of lead the various branch of the pipe which led from one central pipe to all these littl basin sketch out a sort of tree on the front these ramif of pipe with their hundr elbow imit those old leafless vine stock which writh over the front of old farm hous this odd espali with it branch of lead and iron was the first thing that struck jean valjean he seat cosett with her back against a stone post with an injunct to be silent and ran to the spot where the conduit touch the pavement perhap there was some way of climb up by it and enter the hous but the pipe was dilapid and past servic and hard hung to it fasten moreov all the window of this silent dwell were grate with heavi iron bar even the attic window in the roof and then the moon fell full upon that facad and the man who was watch at the corner of the street would have seen jean valjean in the act of climb and final what was to be done with cosett how was she to be drawn up to the top of a three stori hous he gave up all idea of climb by mean of the drain pipe and crawl along the wall to get back into the rue polonceau when he reach the slant of the wall where he had left cosett he notic that no one could see him there as we have just explain he was conceal from all eye no matter from which direct they were approach besid this he was in the shadow final there were two door perhap they might be forc the wall abov which he saw the linden tree and the ivi evid abut on a garden where he could at least hide himself although there were as yet no leav on the tree and spend the remaind of the night time was pass he must act quick he felt over the carriag door and immedi recogn the fact that it was impractic outsid and in he approach the other door with more hope it was fright decrepit it veri immens render it less solid the plank were rotten the iron bandsther were onli three of themwer rust it seem as though it might be possibl to pierc this worm eaten barrier on examin it he found that the door was not a door it had neither hing cross bar lock nor fissur in the middl the iron band travers it from side to side without ani break through the crevic in the plank he caught a view of unhewn slab and block of stone rough cement togeth which passer by might still have seen there ten year ago he was forc to acknowledg with constern that this appar door was simpli the wooden decor of a build against which it was place it was easi to tear off a plank but then one found one self face to face with a wall chapter vwhich would be imposs with gas lantern at that moment a heavi and measur sound began to be audibl at some distanc jean valjean risk a glanc round the corner of the street seven or eight soldier drawn up in a platoon had just debouch into the rue polonceau he saw the gleam of their bayonet they were advanc toward him these soldier at whose head he distinguish javert tall figur advanc slowli and cautious they halt frequent it was plain that they were search all the nook of the wall and all the embrasur of the door and alley this was some patrol that javert had encounteredther could be no mistak as to this surmiseand whose aid he had demand javert two acolyt were march in their rank at the rate at which they were march and in consider of the halt which they were make it would take them about a quarter of an hour to reach the spot where jean valjean stood it was a fright moment a few minut onli separ jean valjean from that terribl precipic which yawn befor him for the third time and the galley now meant not onli the galley but cosett lost to him forev that is to say a life resembl the interior of a tomb there was but one thing which was possibl jean valjean had this peculiar that he carri as one might say two beggar pouch in one he kept his saint thought in the other the redoubt talent of a convict he rummag in the one or the other accord to circumst among his other resourc thank to his numer escap from the prison at toulon he was as it will be rememb a past master in the incred art of crawl up without ladder or climb iron by sheer muscular forc by lean on the nape of his neck his shoulder his hip and his knee by help himself on the rare project of the stone in the right angl of a wall as high as the sixth stori if need be an art which has render so celebr and so alarm that corner of the wall of the conciergeri of pari by which battemoll condemn to death made his escap twenti year ago jean valjean measur with his eye the wall abov which he espi the linden it was about eighteen feet in height the angl which it form with the gabl of the larg build was fill at it lower extrem by a mass of masonri of a triangular shape probabl intend to preserv that too conveni corner from the rubbish of those dirti creatur call the passer by this practic of fill up corner of the wall is much in use in pari this mass was about five feet in height the space abov the summit of this mass which it was necessari to climb was not more than fourteen feet the wall was surmount by a flat stone without a cope cosett was the difficulti for she did not know how to climb a wall should he abandon her jean valjean did not onc think of that it was imposs to carri her a man whole strength is requir to success carri out these singular ascent the least burden would disturb his centr of graviti and pull him downward a rope would have been requir jean valjean had none where was he to get a rope at midnight in the rue polonceau certain if jean valjean had had a kingdom he would have given it for a rope at that moment all extrem situat have their lightn flash which sometim dazzl sometim illumin us jean valjean despair glanc fell on the street lantern post of the blind alley genrot at that epoch there were no gas jet in the street of pari at nightfal lantern place at regular distanc were light they were ascend and descend by mean of a rope which travers the street from side to side and was adjust in a groov of the post the pulley over which this rope ran was fasten underneath the lantern in a littl iron box the key to which was kept by the lamp lighter and the rope itself was protect by a metal case jean valjean with the energi of a suprem struggl cross the street at one bound enter the blind alley broke the latch of the littl box with the point of his knife and an instant later he was besid cosett onc more he had a rope these gloomi inventor of expedi work rapid when they are fight against fatal we have alreadi explain that the lantern had not been light that night the lantern in the cul de sac genrot was thus natur extinct like the rest and one could pass direct under it without even notic that it was no longer in it place nevertheless the hour the place the dark jean valjean absorpt his singular gestur his go and come all had begun to render cosett uneasi ani other child than she would have given vent to loud shriek long befor she content herself with pluck jean valjean by the skirt of his coat they could hear the sound of the patrol approach ever more and more distinct father said she in a veri low voic i am afraid who is come yonder hush repli the unhappi man it is madam thenardi cosett shudder he ad say noth dont interfer with me if you cri out if you weep the thenardi is lie in wait for you she is come to take you back then without hast but without make a useless movement with firm and curt precis the more remark at a moment when the patrol and javert might come upon him at ani moment he undid his cravat pass it round cosett bodi under the armpit take care that it should not hurt the child fasten this cravat to one end of the rope by mean of that knot which seafar men call a swallow knot took the other end of the rope in his teeth pull off his shoe and stock which he threw over the wall step upon the mass of masonri and began to rais himself in the angl of the wall and the gabl with as much solid and certainti as though he had the round of a ladder under his feet and elbow half a minut had not elaps when he was rest on his knee on the wall cosett gaze at him in stupid amaz without utter a word jean valjean injunct and the name of madam thenardi had chill her blood all at onc she heard jean valjean voic cri to her though in a veri low tone put your back against the wall she obey dont say a word and dont be alarm went on jean valjean and she felt herself lift from the ground befor she had time to recov herself she was on the top of the wall jean valjean grasp her put her on his back took her two tini hand in his larg left hand lay down flat on his stomach and crawl along on top of the wall as far as the cant as he had guess there stood a build whose roof start from the top of the wooden barricad and descend to within a veri short distanc of the ground with a gentl slope which graze the linden tree a lucki circumst for the wall was much higher on this side than on the street side jean valjean could onli see the ground at a great depth below him he had just reach the slope of the roof and had not yet left the crest of the wall when a violent uproar announc the arriv of the patrol the thunder voic of javert was audibl search the blind alley the rue droit mur is guard so is the rue petit picpus ill answer for it that he is in the blind alley the soldier rush into the genrot alley jean valjean allow himself to slide down the roof still hold fast to cosett reach the linden tree and leap to the ground whether from terror or courag cosett had not breath a sound though her hand were a littl abrad chapter vith begin of an enigma jean valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was veri vast and of singular aspect one of those melancholi garden which seem made to be look at in winter and at night this garden was oblong in shape with an alley of larg poplar at the further end toler tall forest tree in the corner and an unshad space in the centr where could be seen a veri larg solitari tree then sever fruit tree gnarl and bristl like bush bed of veget a melon patch whose glass frame sparkl in the moonlight and an old well here and there stood stone bench which seem black with moss the alley were border with gloomi and veri erect littl shrub the grass had half taken possess of them and a green mould cover the rest jean valjean had besid him the build whose roof had serv him as a mean of descent a pile of fagot and behind the fagot direct against the wall a stone statu whose mutil face was no longer anyth more than a shapeless mask which loom vagu through the gloom the build was a sort of ruin where dismantl chamber were distinguish one of which much encumb seem to serv as a shed the larg build of the rue droit mur which had a wing on the rue petit picpus turn two facad at right angl toward this garden these interior facad were even more tragic than the exterior all the window were grate not a gleam of light was visibl at ani one of them the upper stori had scuttl like prison one of those facad cast it shadow on the other which fell over the garden like an immens black pall no other hous was visibl the bottom of the garden was lost in mist and dark nevertheless wall could be confus made out which intersect as though there were more cultiv land beyond and the low roof of the rue polonceau noth more wild and solitari than this garden could be imagin there was no one in it which was quit natur in view of the hour but it did not seem as though this spot were made for ani one to walk in even in broad daylight jean valjean first care had been to get hold of his shoe and put them on again then to step under the shed with cosett a man who is flee never think himself suffici hidden the child whose thought were still on the thenardi share his instinct for withdraw from sight as much as possibl cosett trembl and press close to him they heard the tumultu nois of the patrol search the blind alley and the street the blow of their gun stock against the stone javert appeal to the polic spi whom he had post and his imprec mingl with word which could not be distinguish at the expir of a quarter of an hour it seem as though that speci of stormi roar were becom more distant jean valjean held his breath he had laid his hand light on cosett mouth howev the solitud in which he stood was so strang calm that this fright uproar close and furious as it was did not disturb him by so much as the shadow of a misgiv it seem as though those wall had been built of the deaf stone of which the scriptur speak all at onc in the midst of this profound calm a fresh sound aros a sound as celesti divin ineff ravish as the other had been horribl it was a hymn which issu from the gloom a dazzl burst of prayer and harmoni in the obscur and alarm silenc of the night women voic but voic compos at one and the same time of the pure accent of virgin and the innoc accent of childrenvoic which are not of the earth and which resembl those that the newborn infant still hear and which the die man hear alreadi this song proceed from the gloomi edific which tower abov the garden at the moment when the hubbub of demon retreat one would have said that a choir of angel was approach through the gloom cosett and jean valjean fell on their knee they knew not what it was they knew not where they were but both of them the man and the child the penit and the innoc felt that they must kneel these voic had this strang characterist that they did not prevent the build from seem to be desert it was a supernatur chant in an uninhabit hous while these voic were sing jean valjean thought of noth he no longer beheld the night he beheld a blue sky it seem to him that he felt those wing which we all have within us unfold the song die away it may have last a long time jean valjean could not have told hour of ecstasi are never more than a moment all fell silent again there was no longer anyth in the street there was noth in the garden that which had menac that which had reassur himal had vanish the breez sway a few dri weed on the crest of the wall and they gave out a faint sweet melancholi sound chapter viicontinu of the enigma the night wind had risen which indic that it must be between one and two oclock in the morn poor cosett said noth as she had seat herself besid him and lean her head against him jean valjean had fanci that she was asleep he bent down and look at her cosett eye were wide open and her thought air pain jean valjean she was still trembl are you sleepi said jean valjean i am veri cold she repli a moment later she resum is she still there who said jean valjean madam thenardi jean valjean had alreadi forgotten the mean which he had employ to make cosett keep silent ah said he she is gone you need fear noth further the child sigh as though a load had been lift from her breast the ground was damp the shed open on all side the breez grew more keen everi instant the goodman took off his coat and wrap it round cosett are you less cold now said he oh yes father well wait for me a moment i will soon be back he quit the ruin and crept along the larg build seek a better shelter he came across door but they were close there were bar at all the window of the ground floor just after he had turn the inner angl of the edific he observ that he was come to some arch window where he perceiv a light he stood on tipto and peep through one of these window they all open on a toler vast hall pave with larg flagston cut up by arcad and pillar where onli a tini light and great shadow were visibl the light came from a taper which was burn in one corner the apart was desert and noth was stir in it nevertheless by dint of gaze intent he thought he perceiv on the ground someth which appear to be cover with a wind sheet and which resembl a human form this form was lie face downward flat on the pavement with the arm extend in the form of a cross in the immobl of death one would have said judg from a sort of serpent which undul over the floor that this sinist form had a rope round it neck the whole chamber was bath in that mist of place which are spare illumin which add to horror jean valjean often said afterward that although mani funer spectr had cross his path in life he had never beheld anyth more blood curdl and terribl than that enigmat form accomplish some inexplic mysteri in that gloomi place and beheld thus at night it was alarm to suppos that that thing was perhap dead and still more alarm to think that it was perhap aliv he had the courag to plaster his face to the glass and to watch whether the thing would move in spite of his remain thus what seem to him a veri long time the outstretch form made no movement all at onc he felt himself overpow by an inexpress terror and he fled he began to run toward the shed not dare to look behind him it seem to him that if he turn his head he should see that form follow him with great stride and wave it arm he reach the ruin all out of breath his knee were give way beneath him the perspir was pour from him where was he who could ever have imagin anyth like that sort of sepulchr in the midst of pari what was this strang hous an edific full of nocturn mysteri call to soul through the dark with the voic of angel and when they came offer them abrupt that terribl vision promis to open the radiant portal of heaven and then open the horribl gate of the tomb and it actual was an edific a hous which bore a number on the street it was not a dream he had to touch the stone to convinc himself that such was the fact cold anxieti uneasi the emot of the night had given him a genuin fever and all these idea were clash togeth in his brain he step up to cosett she was asleep chapter viiith enigma becom doubli mysteri the child had laid her head on a stone and fallen asleep he sat down besid her and began to think littl by littl as he gaze at her he grew calm and regain possess of his freedom of mind he clear perceiv this truth the foundat of his life henceforth that so long as she was there so long as he had her near him he should need noth except for her he should fear noth except for her he was not even conscious that he was veri cold sinc he had taken off his coat to cover her nevertheless athwart this reveri into which he had fallen he had heard for some time a peculiar nois it was like the tinkl of a bell this sound proceed from the garden it could be heard distinct though faint it resembl the faint vagu music produc by the bell of cattl at night in the pastur this nois made valjean turn round he look and saw that there was some one in the garden a be resembl a man was walk amid the bell glass of the melon bed rise stoop halt with regular movement as though he were drag or spread out someth on the ground this person appear to limp jean valjean shudder with the continu tremor of the unhappi for them everyth is hostil and suspici they distrust the day becaus it enabl peopl to see them and the night becaus it aid in surpris them a littl while befor he had shiver becaus the garden was desert and now he shiver becaus there was some one there he fell back from chimer terror to real terror he said to himself that javert and the spi had perhap not taken their departur that they had no doubt left peopl on the watch in the street that if this man should discov him in the garden he would cri out for help against thiev and deliv him up he took the sleep cosett gentl in his arm and carri her behind a heap of old furnitur which was out of use in the most remot corner of the shed cosett did not stir from that point he scrutin the appear of the be in the melon patch the strang thing about it was that the sound of the bell follow each of this man movement when the man approach the sound approach when the man retreat the sound retreat if he made ani hasti gestur a tremolo accompani the gestur when he halt the sound ceas it appear evid that the bell was attach to that man but what could that signifi who was this man who had a bell suspend about him like a ram or an ox as he put these question to himself he touch cosett hand they were ici cold ah good god he cri he spoke to her in a low voic cosett she did not open her eye he shook her vigor she did not wake is she dead he said to himself and sprang to his feet quiver from head to foot the most fright thought rush pell mell through his mind there are moment when hideous surmis assail us like a cohort of furi and violent forc the partit of our brain when those we love are in question our prudenc invent everi sort of mad he rememb that sleep in the open air on a cold night may be fatal cosett was pale and had fallen at full length on the ground at his feet without a movement he listen to her breath she still breath but with a respir which seem to him weak and on the point of extinct how was he to warm her back to life how was he to rous her all that was not connect with this vanish from his thought he rush wild from the ruin it was absolut necessari that cosett should be in bed and besid a fire in less than a quarter of an hour chapter ixth man with the bell he walk straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden he had taken in his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of his waistcoat the man head was bent down and he did not see him approach in a few stride jean valjean stood besid him jean valjean accost him with the cri one hundr franc the man gave a start and rais

longer thought of jean valjeanth wolf of to day caus these dog who are alway on the chase to forget the wolf of yesterdaywhen in decemb 1823 he read a newspap he who never read newspap but javert a monarch man had a desir to know the particular of the triumphal entri of the princ generalissimo into bayonn just as he was finish the articl which interest him a name the name of jean valjean attract his attent at the bottom of a page the paper announc that the convict jean valjean was dead and publish the fact in such formal term that javert did not doubt it he confin himself to the remark that a

it was not known where or when this report came under javert eye and set him to think the name of fantin was well known to him he rememb that jean valjean had made him javert burst into laughter by ask him for a respit of three day for the purpos of go to fetch that creatur child he recal the fact that jean valjean had been arrest in pari at the veri moment when he was step into the coach for

took the coach from the pewter platter cul de sac de la planchett and made a trip to montfermeil he expect to find a great deal of light on the subject there he found a great deal of obscur for the first few day the thenardi had chatter in their rage the disappear of the lark had creat a sensat in the villag he immedi obtain numer version of the stori which end in the abduct of a child henc the polic report but their first vexat have pass off thenardi with his wonder instinct had veri quick comprehend that it is never advis to stir up the prosecutor of the crown and that his complaint with regard to the abduct of cosett would have as their first result to fix upon himself and upon mani dark affair which he had on hand the glitter eye of justic the last thing that owl desir is to have a candl brought to them and in the first place how explain the fifteen hundr franc which he had receiv he turn squar round put a gag on his wife mouth and feign astonish when the stolen child was mention to him he understood noth about it no doubt he had grumbl for awhil at have that dear littl creatur taken from him so hastili he should have like to keep her two or three day longer out of tender but her grandfath had come for her in the most natur way in the world he ad the grandfath which produc a good effect this was the stori that javert hit upon when he arriv at montfermeil the grandfath caus jean valjean to vanish nevertheless javert drop a few question like plummet into thenardi histori who was that grandfath and what was his name thenardi repli with simplic he is a wealthi farmer i saw his passport i think his name was m guillaum lambert lambert is a respect and extrem reassur name thereupon javert return to pari jean valjean is certain dead said he and i am a ninni he had again begun to forget this histori when in the cours of march 1824 he heard of a singular personag who dwelt in the parish of saint medard and who had been surnam the mendic who give alm this person the stori ran was a man of mean whose name no one knew exact and who live alon with a littl girl of eight year who knew noth about herself save that she had come from montfermeil montfermeil that name was alway come up and it made javert prick up his ear an old beggar polic spi an ex beadl to whom this person had given alm ad a few more detail this gentleman of properti was veri shynev come out except in the even speak to no one except occasion to the poor and never allow ani one to approach him he wore a horribl old yellow frock coat which was worth mani million be all wad with bank bill this piqu javert curios in a decid manner in order to get a close look at this fantast gentleman without alarm him he borrow the beadl outfit for a day and the place where the old spi was in the habit of crouch everi even whine orison through his nose and play the spi under cover of prayer the suspect individu did inde approach javert thus disguis and bestow alm on him at that moment javert rais his head and the shock which jean valjean receiv on recogn javert was equal to the one receiv by javert when he thought he recogn jean valjean howev the dark might have misl him jean valjean death was offici javert cherish veri grave doubt and when in doubt javert the man of scrupl never laid a finger on ani one collar he follow his man to the gorbeau hous and got the old woman to talk which was no difficult matter the old woman confirm the fact regard the coat line with million and narrat to him the episod of the thousand franc bill she had seen it she had handl it javert hire a room that even he instal himself in it he came and listen at the mysteri lodger door hope to catch the sound of his voic but jean valjean saw his candl through the key hole and foil the spi by keep silent on the follow day jean valjean decamp but the nois made by the fall of the five franc piec was notic by the old woman who hear the rattl of coin suspect that he might be intend to leav and made hast to warn javert at night when jean valjean came out javert was wait for him behind the tree of the boulevard with two men javert had demand assist at the prefectur but he had not mention the name of the individu whom he hope to seiz that was his secret and he had kept it for three reason in the first place becaus the slightest indiscret might put jean valjean on the alert next becaus to lay hand on an ex convict who had made his escap and was reput dead on a crimin whom justic had former class forev as among malefactor of the most danger sort was a magnific success which the old member of the parisian polic would assur not leav to a new comer like javert and he was afraid of be depriv of his convict and last becaus javert be an artist had a tast for the unforeseen he hate those well herald success which are talk of long in advanc and have had the bloom brush off he prefer to elabor his masterpiec in the dark and to unveil them sudden at the last javert had follow jean valjean from tree to tree then from corner to corner of the street and had not lost sight of him for a singl instant even at the moment when jean valjean believ himself to be the most secur javert eye had been on him whi had not javert arrest jean valjean becaus he was still in doubt it must be rememb that at that epoch the polic was not precis at it eas the free press embarrass it sever arbitrari arrest denounc by the newspap had echo even as far as the chamber and had render the prefectur timid interfer with individu liberti was a grave matter the polic agent were afraid of make a mistak the prefect laid the blame on them a mistak meant dismiss the reader can imagin the effect which this brief paragraph reproduc by twenti newspap would have caus in pari yesterday an age grandfath with white hair a respect and well to do gentleman who was walk with his grandchild age eight was arrest and conduct to the agenc of the prefectur as an escap convict let us repeat in addit that javert had scrupl of his own injunct of his conscienc were ad to the injunct of the prefect he was realli in doubt jean valjean turn his back on him and walk in the dark sad uneasi anxieti depress this fresh misfortun of be forc to flee by night to seek a chanc refug in pari for cosett and himself the necess of regul his pace to the pace of the childal this without his be awar of it had alter jean valjean walk and impress on his bear such senil that the polic themselv incarn in the person of javert might and did in fact make a mistak the imposs of approach too close his costum of an emigr preceptor the declar of thenardi which made a grandfath of him and final the belief in his death in prison ad still further to the uncertainti which gather thick in javert mind for an instant it occur to him to make an abrupt demand for his paper but if the man was not jean valjean and if this man was not a good honest old fellow live on his incom he was probabl some merri blade deepli and cun implic in the obscur web of parisian misde some chief of a danger band who gave alm to conceal his other talent which was an old dodg he had trusti fellow accomplic retreat in case of emerg in which he would no doubt take refug all these turn which he was make through the street seem to indic that he was not a simpl and honest man to arrest him too hastili would be to kill the hen that laid the golden egg where was the inconveni in wait javert was veri sure that he would not escap thus he proceed in a toler perplex state of mind put to himself a hundr question about this enigmat personag it was onli quit late in the rue de pontois that thank to the brilliant light thrown from a dram shop he decid recogn jean valjean there are in this world two be who give a profound startth mother who recov her child and the tiger who recov his prey javert gave that profound start as soon as he had posit recogn jean valjean the formid convict he perceiv that there were onli three of them and he ask for reinforc at the polic station of the rue de pontois one put on glove befor grasp a thorn cudgel this delay and the halt at the carrefour rollin to consult with his agent came near caus him to lose the trail he speedili divin howev that jean valjean would want to put the river between his pursuer and himself he bent his head and reflect like a blood hound who put his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the right scent javert with his power rectitud of instinct went straight to the bridg of austerlitz a word with the toll keeper furnish him with the inform which he requir have you seen a man with a littl girl i made him pay two sous repli the toll keeper javert reach the bridg in season to see jean valjean travers the small illumin spot on the other side of the water lead cosett by the hand he saw him enter the rue du chemin vert saint antoin he rememb the cul de sac genrot arrang there like a trap and of the sole exit of the rue droit mur into the rue petit picpus he made sure of his back burrow as huntsmen say he hastili despatch one of his agent by a roundabout way to guard that issu a patrol which was return to the arsenal post have pass him he made a requisit on it and caus it to accompani him in such game soldier are ace moreov the principl is that in order to get the best of a wild boar one must employ the scienc of veneri and plenti of dog these combin have been effect feel that jean valjean was caught between the blind alley genrot on the right his agent on the left and himself javert in the rear he took a pinch of snuff then he began the game he experienc one ecstat and infern moment he allow his man to go on ahead know that he had him safe but desir of postpon the moment of arrest as long as possibl happi at the thought that he was taken and yet at see him free gloat over him with his gaze with that voluptu of the spider which allow the fli to flutter and of the cat which let the mous run claw and talon possess a monstrous sensualityth obscur movement of the creatur imprison in their pincer what a delight this strangl is javert was enjoy himself the mesh of his net were stout knot he was sure of success all he had to do now was to close his hand accompani as he was the veri idea of resist was imposs howev vigor energet and desper jean valjean might be illustr javert on the hunt 2b5 10 javert on the hunt javert advanc slowli sound search on his way all the nook of the street like so mani pocket of thiev when he reach the centr of the web he found the fli no longer there his exasper can be imagin he interrog his sentinel of the rue droit mur and petit picpus that agent who had remain imperturb at his post had not seen the man pass it sometim happen that a stag is lost head and horn that is to say he escap although he has the pack on his veri heel and then the oldest huntsmen know not what to say duvivi lignivill and desprez halt short in a discomfitur of this sort artong exclaim it was not a stag but a sorcer javert would have like to utter the same cri his disappoint border for a moment on despair and rage it is certain that napoleon made mistak dure the war with russia that alexand commit blunder in the war in india that caesar made mistak in the war in africa that cyrus was at fault in the war in scythia and that javert blunder in this campaign against jean valjean he was wrong perhap in hesit in his recognit of the exconvict the first glanc should have suffic him he was wrong in not arrest him pure and simpli in the old build he was wrong in not arrest him when he posit recogn him in the rue de pontois he was wrong in take counsel with his auxiliari in the full light of the moon in the carrefour rollin advic is certain use it is a good thing to know and to interrog those of the dog who

formula alon vari thus at the infant jesus they say at this hour and at everi hour may the love of jesus kindl my heart the bernardin benedictin of martin verga cloister fifti year ago at petit picpus chant the offic to a solemn psalmodi a pure gregorian chant and alway with full voic dure the whole cours of the offic everywher in the missal where an asterisk occur they paus and say in a low voic jesus mari joseph for the offic of the dead they adopt a tone so low that the voic of women can hard descend to such a depth the effect produc is strike and tragic the nun of the petit picpus had made a vault under their grand altar for the burial of their communiti the govern as they say doe not permit this vault to receiv coffin so they leav the convent when they die this is an afflict to them and caus them constern as an infract of the rule they had obtain a mediocr consol at bestpermiss to be inter at a special hour and in a special corner in the ancient vaugirard cemeteri which was made of land which had former belong to their communiti on friday the nun hear high mass vesper and all the offic as on sunday they scrupul observ in addit all the littl festiv unknown to peopl of the world of which the church of franc was so prodig in the olden day and of which it is still prodig in spain and itali their station in the chapel are intermin as for the number and durat of their prayer we can convey no better idea of them than by quot the ingenu remark of one of them the prayer of the postul are fright the prayer of the novic are still wors and the prayer of the profess nun are still wors onc a week the chapter assembl the prioress presid the vocal mother assist each sister kneel in turn on the stone and confess aloud in the presenc of all the fault and sin which she has

notifi the culprit by a slight tap of her foot against the wood of her stall that she can rise the coulp or peccavi is made for a veri small mattera broken glass a torn veil an involuntari delay of a

instead of ecc she utter aloud the three note do si sol for this piec of absent minded she underw a coulp which last dure the whole servic what render the fault enorm was the fact that the chapter had laugh when a nun is summon to the parlor even were it the prioress herself she drop her veil as will be rememb so that onli her mouth is visibl the prioress alon can hold communic with stranger the other can see onli their immedi famili and that veri rare if by chanc an outsid present herself to see a nun or one whom she has known and love in the outer world a regular seri of negoti is requir if

the reader will permit us one other littl digress utter foreign to this book but characterist and use sinc it show that the cloister even has it origin figur in the littl convent there was a centenarian who came from the abbey of fontevrault she had even been in societi befor the revolut she talk a great deal of m de miromesnil keeper of the seal under loui xvi and of a presidentess duplat with whom she had been veri intim it was her pleasur and her vaniti to drag in these name on everi pretext she told wonder of the abbey of fontevraultthat it was like a citi and that there were street in the monasteri she talk with a picard accent which amus the pupil everi year she solemn renew her vow and at the moment of take the oath she said to the priest monseigneur saint francoi gave it to monseigneur saint julien monseigneur saint julien gave it to monseigneur saint eusebius monseigneur saint eusebius gave it to monseigneur saint procopius etc etc and thus i give it to you father and the school girl would begin to laugh not in their sleev but under their veil charm littl stifl laugh which made the vocal mother frown on anoth occas the centenarian was tell stori she said that in her youth the bernardin monk were everi whit as good as the mousquetair it was a centuri which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth centuri she told about the custom of the four wine which exist befor the revolut in champagn and bourgogn when a great personag a marshal of franc a princ a duke and a peer travers a town in burgundi or champagn the citi father came out to harangu him and

the fourth hog wine these four legend express the four stage descend by the drunkard the first intox which enliven the second that which irrit the third that which dull and the fourth that which brutal in a cupboard under lock and key she kept a mysteri object of which she thought a great deal the rule of fontevrault did not forbid this she would not show this object to anyon she shut herself up which her rule allow her to do and hid herself everi time that she desir to contempl it if she heard a footstep in the corridor she close the cupboard again as hastili as it was possibl with her age hand as soon as it was mention to her she becam silent she who was so fond of talk the most curious were baffl by her silenc and the most tenaci by her obstinaci thus it furnish a subject of comment for all those who were unoccupi or bore in the convent what could that treasur of the centenarian be which was so precious and so secret some holi book no doubt some uniqu chaplet some authent relic they lost themselv in conjectur when the poor old woman die they rush to her cupboard more hastili than was fit perhap and open it they found the object beneath a tripl linen cloth like some

visit from outsid becaus said she the parlor is too gloomi chapter xorigin of the perpetu ador howev this almost sepulchr parlor of which we have sought to convey an idea is a pure local trait which is not reproduc with the same sever in other convent at the convent of the rue du templ in particular which belong in truth to anoth order the black shutter were replac by brown curtain and the parlor itself was a salon with a polish wood floor whose window were drape in white muslin curtain and whose wall admit all sort of frame a portrait of a benedictin nun with unveil face paint bouquet and even the head of a turk it is in that garden of the templ convent that stood that famous chestnut tree which was renown as the finest and the largest in franc and which bore the reput among the good peopl of the eighteenth centuri of be the father of all the chestnut tree of the realm as we have said this convent of the templ was occupi by benedictin of the perpetu ador benedictin quit differ from those who depend on citeaux this order of the perpetu ador is not veri ancient and doe not go back more than two hundr year in 1649 the holi sacrament was profan on two occas a few day apart in two church in pari at saint sulpic and at saint jean en greve a rare and fright sacrileg which set the whole town in an uproar m the prior and vicar general of saint germain des pres order a solemn process of all his clergi in which the pope nuncio offici but this expiat did not satisfi two saint women madam courtin marquis de bouc and the comtess de chateauvieux this outrag commit on the most holi sacrament of the altar though but temporari would not depart from these holi soul and it seem to them that it could onli be extenu by a perpetu ador in some femal monasteri both of them one in 1652 the other in 1653 made donat of notabl sum to mother catherin de bar call of the holi sacrament a benedictin nun for the purpos of found to this pious end a monasteri of the order of saint benoit the first permiss for this foundat was given to mother catherin de bar by m de metz abb of saint germain on condit that no woman could be receiv unless she contribut three hundr livr incom which amount to six thousand livr to the princip after the abb of saint germain the king accord letter patent and all the rest abbati charter and royal letter was confirm in 1654 by the chamber of account and the parliament such is the origin of the legal consecr of the establish of the benedictin of the perpetu ador of the holi sacrament at pari their first convent was a new build in the rue cassett out of the contribut of mesdam de bouc and de chateauvieux this order as it will be seen was not to be confound with the benedictin nun of citeaux it mount back to the abb of saint germain des pres in the same manner that the ladi of the sacr heart go back to the general of the jesuit and the sister of chariti to the general of the lazarist it was also total differ from the bernardin of the petit picpus whose interior we have just shown in 1657 pope alexand vii had author by a special brief the bernardin of the rue petit picpus to practis the perpetu ador like the benedictin nun of the holi sacrament but the two order remain distinct none the less chapter xiend of the petit picpus at the begin of the restor the convent of the petit picpus was in it decay this form a part of the general death of the order which after the eighteenth centuri has been disappear like all the religi order contempl is like prayer one of human need but like everyth which the revolut touch it will be transform and from be hostil to social progress it will becom favor to it the hous of the petit picpus was becom rapid depopul in 1840 the littl convent had disappear the school had disappear there were no longer ani old women nor young girl the first were dead the latter had taken their departur volaverunt the rule of the perpetu ador is so rigid in it natur that it alarm vocat recoil befor it the order receiv no recruit in 1845 it still obtain lay sister here and there but of profess nun none at all forti year ago the nun number near a hundr fifteen year ago there were not more than twenti eight of them how mani are there to day in 1847 the prioress was young a sign that the circl of choic was restrict she was not forti year old in proport as the number diminish the fatigu increas the servic of each becom more pain the moment could then be seen draw near when there would be but a dozen bent and ach shoulder to bear the heavi rule of saint benoit the burden is implac and remain the same for the few as for the mani it weigh down it crush thus they die at the period when the author of this book still live in pari two die one was twenti five year old the other twenti three this

a convent it was into this hous that jean valjean had as fauchelev express it fallen from the sky he had scale the wall of the garden which form the angl of the rue polonceau that hymn of the angel which he had heard in the middl of the night was the nun chant matin that hall of which he had caught a glimps in the gloom was the chapel that phantom which he had seen stretch on the ground was the sister who was make repar that bell the sound of which had so strang surpris him was the garden bell attach to the knee of father fauchelev cosett onc put to bed jean valjean and fauchelev had as we have alreadi seen sup on a glass of wine and a bit of chees befor a good crackl fire then the onli bed in the hut be occupi by cosett each threw himself on a truss of straw befor he shut his eye jean valjean said i must remain here henceforth this remark trot through fauchelev head all night long to tell the truth neither of them slept jean valjean feel that he was discov and that javert was on his scent understood that he and cosett were lost if they return to pari then the new storm which had just burst upon him had strand him in this cloister jean valjean had henceforth but one thoughtto remain there now for an unfortun man in his posit this convent was both the safest and the most danger of place the most danger becaus as no men might enter there if he were discov it was a flagrant offenc and jean valjean would find but one step interven between the convent and prison the safest becaus if he could manag to get himself accept there and remain there who would ever seek him in such a place to dwell in an imposs place was safeti on his side fauchelev was cudgel his brain he began by declar to himself that he understood noth of the matter how had m madelein got there when the wall were what they were cloister wall are not to be step over how did he get there with a child one cannot scale a perpendicular wall with a child in one arm who was that child where did they both come from sinc fauchelev had live in the convent he had heard noth of m sur m and he knew noth of what had taken place there father madelein had an air which discourag question and besid fauchelev said to himself one doe not question a saint m madelein had preserv all his prestig in fauchelev eye onli from some word which jean valjean had let fall the garden thought he could draw the infer that m madelein had probabl becom bankrupt through the hard time and that he was pursu by his creditor or that he had compromis himself in some polit affair and was in hide which last did not displeas fauchelev who like mani of our peasant of the north had an old fund of bonapart about him while in hide m madelein had select the convent as a refug and it was quit simpl that he should wish to remain there but the inexplic point to which fauchelev return constant and over which he weari his brain was that m madelein should be there and that he should have that littl girl with him fauchelev saw them touch them spoke to them and still did not believ it possibl the incomprehens had just made it entranc into fauchelev hut fauchelev grope about amid conjectur and could see noth clear but this m madelein save my life this certainti alon was suffici and decid his cours he said to himself it is my turn now he ad in his conscienc m madelein did not stop to deliber when it was a question of thrust himself under the cart for the purpos of drag me out he made up his mind to save m madelein nevertheless he put mani question to himself and made himself diver repli after what he did for me would i save him if he were a thief just the same if he were an assassin would i save him just the same sinc he is a saint shall i save him just the same but what a problem it was to manag to have him remain in the convent fauchelev did not recoil in the face of this almost chimer undertak this poor peasant of picardi without ani other ladder than his self devot his good will and a littl of that old rustic cun on this occas enlist in the servic of a generous enterpris undertook to scale the difficulti of the cloister and the steep escarp of the rule of saint benoit father fauchelev was an old man who had been an egoist all his life and who toward the end of his day halt infirm with no interest left to him in the world found it sweet to be grate and perceiv a generous action to be perform flung himself upon it like a man who at the moment when he is die should find close to his hand a glass of good wine which he had never tast and should swallow it with avid we may add that the air which he had breath for mani year in this convent had destroy all person in him and had end by render a good action of some kind absolut necessari to him so he took his resolv to devot himself to m madelein we have just call him a poor peasant of picardi that descript is just but incomplet at the point of this stori which we have now reach a littl of father fauchelev physiolog becom use he was a peasant but he had been a notari which ad trickeri to his cun and penetr to his ingenu have through various caus fail in his busi he had descend to the call of a carter and a labor but in spite of oath and lash which hors seem to requir someth of the notari had linger in him he had some natur wit he talk good grammar he convers which is a rare thing in a villag and the other peasant said of him he talk almost like a gentleman with a hat fauchelev belong in fact to that speci which the impertin and flippant vocabulari of the last centuri qualifi as demi bourgeoi demi lout and which the metaphor shower by the chateau upon the thatch cottag ticket in the pigeon hole of the plebeian rather rustic rather citifi pepper and salt fauchelev though sore tri and harsh use by fate worn out a sort of poor threadbar old soul was nevertheless an impuls man and extrem spontan in his action a precious qualiti which prevent one from ever be wick his defect and his vice for he had some were all superfici in short his physiognomi was of the kind which succeed with an observ his age face had none of those disagre wrinkl at the top of the forehead which signifi malic or stupid at daybreak father fauchelev open his eye after have done an enorm deal of think and beheld m madelein seat on his truss of straw and watch cosett slumber fauchelev sat up and said now that you are here how are you go to contriv to enter this remark sum up the situat and arous jean valjean from his reveri the two men took counsel togeth in the first place said fauchelev you will begin by not set foot outsid of this chamber either you or the child one step in the garden and we are done for that is true monsieur madelein resum fauchelev you have arriv at a veri auspici moment i mean to say a veri inauspici moment one of the ladi is veri ill this will prevent them from look much in our direct it seem that she is die the prayer of the forti hour are be said the whole communiti is in confus that occupi them the one who is on the point of departur is a saint in fact we are all saint here all the differ between them and me is that they say our cell and that i say my cabin the prayer for the die are to be said and then the prayer for the dead we shall be at peac here for to day but i will not answer for to morrow still observ jean valjean this cottag is in the nich of the wall it is hidden by a sort of ruin there are tree it is not visibl from the convent and i add that the nun never come near it well said jean valjean the interrog mark which accentu this well signifi it seem to me that one may remain conceal here it was to this interrog point that fauchelev respond there are the littl girl what littl girl ask jean valjean just as fauchelev open his mouth to explain the word which he had utter a bell emit one stroke the nun is dead said he there is the knell and he made a sign to jean valjean to listen the bell struck a second time it is the knell monsieur madelein the bell will continu to strike onc a minut for twenti four hour until the bodi is taken from the churchyou see they play at recreat hour it suffic to have a ball roll asid to send them all hither in spite of prohibit to hunt and rummag for it all about here those cherub are devil who ask jean valjean the littl girl you would be veri quick discov they would shriek oh a man there is no danger to day there will be no recreat hour the day will be entir devot to prayer you hear the bell as i told you a stroke each minut it is the death knell i understand father fauchelev there are pupil and jean valjean thought to himself here is cosett educ alreadi provid fauchelev exclaim pardin there are littl girl inde and they would bawl around you and they would rush off to be a man here is to have the plagu you see how they fasten a bell to my paw as though i were a wild beast jean valjean fell into more and more profound thoughtthi convent would be our salvat he murmur then he rais his voic yes the difficulti is to remain here no said fauchelev the difficulti is to get out jean valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart to get out yes monsieur madelein in order to return here it is first necessari to get out and after wait until anoth stroke of the knell had sound fauchelev went on you must not be found here in this fashion whenc come you for me you fall from heaven becaus i know you but the nun requir one to enter by the door all at onc they heard a rather complic peal from anoth bell ah said fauchelev they are ring up the vocal mother they are go to the chapter they alway hold a chapter when ani one die she die at daybreak peopl general do die at daybreak but cannot you get out by the way in which you enter come i do not ask for the sake of question you but how did you get in jean valjean turn pale the veri thought of descend again into that terribl street made him shudder you make your way out of a forest fill with tiger and onc out of it imagin a friend counsel that shall advis you to return thither jean valjean pictur to himself the whole polic forc still engag in swarm in that quarter agent on the watch sentinel everywher fright fist extend toward his collar javert at the corner of the intersect of the street perhap imposs said he father fauchelev say that i fell from the sky but i believ it i believ it retort fauchelev you have no need to tell me that the good god must have taken you in his hand for the purpos of get a good look at you close to and then drop you onli he meant to place you in a man convent he made a mistak come there goe anoth peal that is to order the porter to go and inform the municip that the dead doctor is to come here and view a corps all that is the ceremoni of die these good ladi are not at all fond of that visit a

i thought it was onli an affair of gallantri it seem that it is an affair of passion it was a passion in fact marius was on the high road to ador his father at the same time his idea underw an extraordinari chang the phase of this chang were numer and success as this is the histori of mani mind of our day we think it will prove use to follow these phase step by step and to indic them all that histori upon which he had just cast his eye appal him the first effect was to dazzl him up to that time the republ the empir had been to him onli monstrous word the republ a guillotin in the twilight the empir a sword in the night he had just taken a look at it and where he had expect to find onli a chao of shadow he had beheld with a sort of unpreced surpris mingl with fear and joy star sparkl mirabeau vergniaud saint just robespierr camill desmoulin danton and a sun aris napoleon he did not know where he stood he recoil blind by the brilliant light littl by littl when his astonish had pass off he grew accustom to this radianc he contempl these deed without dizzi he examin these personag without terror the revolut and the empir present themselv lumin in perspect befor his mind eye he beheld each of these group of event and of men sum up in two tremend fact the republ in the sovereignti of civil right restor to the mass the empir in the sovereignti of the french idea impos on europ he beheld the grand figur of the peopl emerg from the revolut and the grand figur of franc spring forth from the empir he assert in his conscienc that all this had been good what his dazzl state neglect in this his first far too synthet estim we do not think it necessari to point out here it is the state of a mind on the march that we are record progress is not accomplish in one stage that state onc for all in connect with what preced as well as with what is to follow we continu he then perceiv that up to that moment he had comprehend his countri no more than he had comprehend his father he had not known either the one or the other and a sort of voluntari night had obscur his eye now he saw and on the one hand he admir while on the other he ador he was fill with regret and remors and he reflect in despair that all he had in his soul could now be said onli to the tomb oh if his father had still been in exist if he had still had him if god in his compass and his good had permit his father to be still among the live how he would have run how he would have precipit himself how he would have cri to his father father here i am it is i i have the same heart as thou i am thi son how he would have embrac that white head bath his hair in tear gaze upon his scar press his hand ador his garment kiss his feet oh whi had his father die so earli befor his time befor the justic the love of his son had come to him marius had a continu sob in his heart which said to him everi moment ala at the same time he becam more truli serious more truli grave more sure of his thought and his faith at each instant gleam of the true came to complet his reason an inward growth seem to be in progress within him he was conscious of a sort of natur enlarg which gave him two thing that were new to himhi father and his countri as everyth open when one has a key so he explain to himself that which he had hate he penetr that which he had abhor henceforth he plain perceiv the providenti divin and human sens of the great thing which he had been taught to detest and of the great men whom he had been instruct to curs when he reflect on his former opinion which were but those of yesterday and which nevertheless seem to him alreadi so veri ancient he grew indign yet he smile from the rehabilit of his father he natur pass to the rehabilit of napoleon but the latter we will confess was not effect without labor from his infanc he had been imbu with the judgment of the parti of 1814 on bonapart now all the prejudic of the restor all it interest all it instinct tend to disfigur napoleon it execr him even more than it did robespierr it had veri clever turn to suffici good account the fatigu of the nation and the hatr of mother bonapart had becom an almost fabul monster and in order to paint him to the imagin of the peopl which as we late point out resembl the imagin of children the parti of 1814 made him appear under all sort of terrifi mask in success from that which is terribl though it remain grandios to that which is terribl and becom grotesqu from tiberius to the bugaboo thus in speak of bonapart one was free to sob or to puff up with laughter provid that hatr lay at the bottom marius had never entertainedabout that man as he was calledani other idea in his mind they had combin with the tenac which exist in his natur there was in him a headstrong littl man who hate napoleon on read histori on studi him especi in the document and materi for histori the veil which conceal napoleon from the eye of marius was gradual rent he caught a glimps of someth immens and he suspect that he had been deceiv up to that moment on the score of bonapart as about all the rest each day he saw more distinct and he set about mount slowli step by step almost regret in the begin then with intox and as though attract by an irresist fascin first the sombr step then the vagu illumin step at last the lumin and splendid step of enthusiasm one night he was alon in his littl chamber near the roof his candl was burn he was read with his elbow rest on his tabl close to the open window all sort of reveri reach him from space and mingl with his thought what a spectacl is the night one hear dull sound without know whenc they proceed one behold jupit which is twelv hundr time larger than the earth glow like a firebrand the azur is black the star shine it is formid he was perus the bulletin of the grand armi those heroic stroph pen on the field of battl there at interv he beheld his father name alway the name of the emperor the whole of that great empir present itself to him he felt a flood swell and rise within him it seem to him at moment that his father pass close to him like a breath and whisper in his ear he gradual got into a singular state he thought that he heard drum cannon trumpet the measur tread of battalion the dull and distant gallop of the cavalri from time to time his eye were rais heavenward and gaze upon the coloss constel as they gleam in the measureless depth of space then they fell upon his book onc more and there they beheld other coloss thing move confus his heart contract within him he was in a transport trembl pant all at onc without himself know what was in him and what impuls he was obey he sprang to his feet stretch both arm out of the window gaze intent into the gloom the silenc the infinit dark the etern immens and exclaim long live the emperor from that moment forth all was over the ogr of corsicath usurperth tyrantth monster who was the lover of his own sistersth actor who took lesson of talmath poison of jaffath tigerbuonaparteal this vanish and gave place in his mind to a vagu and brilliant radianc in which shone at an inaccess height the pale marbl phantom of caesar the emperor had been for his father onli the well belov captain whom one admir for whom one sacrific one self he was someth more to marius he was the predestin constructor of the french group succeed the roman group

that like all new convert to a religion his convers intox him he hurl himself headlong into adhes and he went too far his natur was so construct onc on the downward slope it was almost imposs for him to put on the drag fanatic for the sword took possess of him and complic in his mind his enthusiasm for the idea he did not perceiv that along with genius and pell mell he was admit forc that is to say that he was instal in two compart of his idolatri on the one hand that which is divin on the other that which is brutal in mani respect he had set about deceiv himself otherwis he admit everyth there is a way of encount error while on one way to the truth he had a violent sort of good faith which took everyth in the lump in the new path which he had enter on in judg the mistak of the old regim as in measur the glori of napoleon he neglect the attenu circumst at all event a tremend step had been taken where he had former beheld the fall of the monarchi he now saw the advent of franc

exist in him two men the feroci man and the adroit man up to that moment in the excess of his triumph in the presenc of the prey which had been brought down and which did not stir the feroci man had prevail when the victim struggl and tri to resist the adroit man reappear and took the upper hand dont hurt him he repeat and without suspect it his first success was to arrest the pistol in the act of be discharg and to paralyz marius in whose opinion the urgenc of the case disappear and who in the face of this new phase saw no inconveni in wait a while longer who know whether some chanc would not aris which would deliv him from the horribl altern of allow ursul father to perish or of destroy the colonel saviour a herculean struggl had begun with one blow full in the chest m leblanc had sent the old man tumbl roll in the middl of the room then with two backward sweep of his hand he had overthrown two more assail and he held one under each of his knee the wretch were rattl in the throat beneath this pressur as under a granit millston but the other four had seiz the formid old man by both arm and the back of his neck and were hold him doubl up over the two chimney builder on

disappear under the horribl group of ruffian like the wild boar beneath a howl pile of dog and hound they succeed in overthrow him upon the bed nearest the window and there they held him in awe the thenardi woman had not releas her clutch on his hair dont you mix yourself up in this affair said thenardi youll tear your shawl the thenardi obey as the femal wolf obey the male wolf with a growl now said thenardi search him you other fellow m leblanc seem to have renounc the idea of resist they search him he had noth on his person except a leather purs contain six franc and his handkerchief thenardi put the handkerchief into his own pocket what no pocket book he demand no nor watch repli one of the chimney builder never mind murmur the mask man who carri the big key in the voic of a

who had been stretch across the room by the blow from m leblanc fist and who made no movement he ad is boulatruell dead no repli bigrenaill hes drunk sweep him into a corner said thenardi two of the chimney builder push the drunken man into the corner near the heap of old iron with their feet babet said thenardi in a low tone to the man with the cudgel whi did you bring so mani they were not need what can you do repli the man with the cudgel they all want to be in it this is a bad season there no busi go on the pallet on which m leblanc had been thrown was a sort of hospit bed elev on four coars wooden leg rough hewn m leblanc let them take their own cours the ruffian bound him secur in an upright attitud with his feet on the ground at the head of the bed the end which was most remot from the window and nearest to the fireplac when the last knot had been tie thenardi took a chair and seat himself almost face m leblanc thenardi no longer look like himself in the cours of a few moment his face had pass from unbridl violenc to tranquil and cun sweet marius found it difficult to recogn in that polish smile of a man in offici life the almost bestial mouth which had been foam but a moment befor he gaze with amaz on that fantast and alarm metamorphosi and he felt as a man might feel who should behold a tiger convert into a lawyer monsieur said thenardi and dismiss with a gestur the ruffian who still kept their hand on m leblanc stand off a littl and let me have a talk with the gentleman all retir toward the door he went on monsieur you did wrong to tri to jump out of the window you might have broken your leg now if you will permit me we will convers quiet in the first place i must communic to you an observ which i have made which is that you have not utter the faintest cri thenardi was right this detail was correct although it had escap marius in his agit m leblanc had bare pronounc a few word without rais his voic and even dure his struggl with the six ruffian near the window he had preserv the most profound and singular silenc thenardi continu mon dieu you might have shout stop thief a bit and i should not have thought it improp murder that too is said occasion and so far as i am concern i should not have taken it in bad part it is veri natur that you should make a littl row when you find yourself with person who dont inspir you with suffici confid you might have done that and no one would have troubl you on that account you would not even have been gag and i will tell you whi this room is veri privat that it onli recommend but it has that in it favor you might fire off a mortar and it would produc about as much nois at the nearest polic station as the snore of a drunken man here a cannon would make a boum and the thunder would make a pouf it a handi lodg but in short you did not shout and it is better so i present you my compliment and i will tell you the conclus that i draw from that fact my dear sir when a man shout who come the polic and after the polic justic well you have not made an outcri that is becaus you dont care to have the polic and the court come in ani more than we do it is becausei have long suspect

fact and the fact into right that is the task of sage chapter iibad sew but the task of sage is one thing the task of clever men is anoth the revolut of 1830 came to a sudden halt as soon as a revolut has made the coast the skil make hast to prepar the shipwreck the skil in our centuri have confer on themselv the titl of statesmen so that this word statesmen has end by becom somewhat of a slang word it must be born in mind in fact that wherev there is noth but skill there is necessarili petti to say the skil amount to say the mediocr in the same way to say statesmen is sometim equival to say

requir of a peopl after a revolut when this peopl form part of a monarch contin is to procur for itself a dynasti in this way say they peac that is to say time to dress our wound and to repair the

man of fortun who come to hand suffic for the manufactur of a king you have in the first case napoleon in the second iturbid but the first famili that come to hand doe not suffic to make a dynasti there is necessarili requir a certain modicum of antiqu in a race and the wrinkl of the centuri cannot be improvis if we place ourselv at the point of view of the statesmen after make all allow of cours after a revolut what are the qualiti of the king which result from it he may be and it is use for him to be a revolutionari that is to say a particip in his own person in that revolut that he should have lent a hand to it that he should have either compromis or distinguish himself therein that he should have touch the axe or wield the sword in it what are the qualiti of a dynasti it should be nation that is to say revolutionari at a distanc not through act commit but by reason of idea accept it should be compos of past and be histor be compos of futur and be sympathet all this explain

histori will do justic to him for this loyalti loui philipp like all histor men who have pass from the scene is to day put on his trial by the human conscienc his case is as yet onli in the lower court the hour when histori speak with it free and vener accent has not yet sound for him the moment has not come to pronounc a definit judgment on this king the auster and illustri historian loui blanc has himself recent soften his first verdict loui philipp was elect by those two almost which are call the 221 and 1830 that is to say by a half parliament and a half revolut and in ani case from the superior point of view where philosophi must place itself we cannot judg him here as the reader has seen abov except with certain reserv in the name of the absolut democrat principl in the eye of

cover his tabl he examin them all it was anguish to him to abandon these miser condemn head one day he said to the same wit to whom we have recent refer i won seven last night dure the earli year of

loui philipp was as gentl as loui ix and as kind as henri iv now to our mind in histori where kind is the rarest of pearl the man who is kind almost take preced of the man who is great loui philipp

penetr into the depth of one of the tragic cloud which envelop the begin of loui philipp reign it was necessari that there should be no equivoqu and it becam requisit that this book should offer some explan with regard to this king loui philipp had enter into possess of his royal author without violenc without ani direct action on his part by virtu of a revolutionari chang evid quit distinct from the real aim of the revolut but in which he the duc dorlean exercis no person initi he had been born a princ and he believ himself to have been elect king he had not serv this mandat on himself he had not taken it it had been offer to him and he had accept it convinc wrong to be sure but convinc nevertheless that the offer was in accord with right and that the accept of it was in accord with duti henc his possess was in good faith now we say it in good conscienc loui philipp be in possess in perfect good faith and the democraci be in good faith in it attack the amount of terror discharg by the

the hovel paid the quarter rent which he owe to maam bougon had his book his bed his tabl his commod and his two chair load on a hand cart and went off without leav his address so that when javert return in the cours of the morn for the purpos of question marius as to the event of the preced even he found onli maam bougon who answer move away maam bougon was convinc that marius was to some extent an accomplic of the robber who had been seiz the night befor who would ever have said it she exclaim to the portress of the quarter a young man like that who had the air of a girl marius had two reason for this prompt chang of resid the first was that he now had a horror of that hous where he had beheld so close at hand and in it most repuls and most feroci develop a social deform which is perhap even more terribl than the wick rich man the wick poor man the second was that he did not wish to figur in the lawsuit which would insu in all probabl and be brought in to testifi against thenardi javert thought that the young man whose name he had forgotten was afraid and had fled or perhap had not even return home at the time of the ambush he made some effort to find him howev but without success a month pass then anoth marius was still with courfeyrac he had learn from a young licenti in law an habitu frequent of the court that thenardi was in close confin everi monday marius had five franc hand in to the clerk offic of la forc for thenardi as marius had no longer ani money he borrow the five franc from courfeyrac it was the first time in his life that he had ever borrow money these period five franc were a doubl riddl to courfeyrac who lent and to thenardi who receiv them to whom can they go thought courfeyrac whenc can this come to me thenardi ask himself moreov marius was heart broken everyth had plung through a trap door onc more he no longer saw anyth befor him his life was again buri in mysteri where he wander fumbl he had for a moment beheld veri close at hand in that obscur the young girl whom he love the old man who seem to be her father those unknown be who were his onli interest and his onli hope in this world and at the veri moment when he thought himself on the point of grasp them a gust had swept all these shadow away not a spark of certainti and truth had been emit even in the most terribl of collis no conjectur was possibl he no longer knew even the name that he thought he knew it certain was not ursul and the lark was a nicknam and what was he to think of the old man was he actual in hide from the polic the white hair workman whom marius had encount in the vicin of the invalid recur to his mind it now seem probabl that that workingman and m leblanc were one and the same person so he disguis himself that man had his heroic and his equivoc side whi had he not call for help whi had he fled was he or was he not the father of the young girl was he in short the man whom thenardi thought that he recogn thenardi might have been mistaken these form so mani insolubl problem all this it is true detract noth from the angel charm of the young girl of the luxembourg heart rend distress marius bore a passion in his heart and night over his eye he was thrust onward he was drawn and he could not stir all had vanish save love of love itself he had lost the instinct and the sudden illumin ordinarili this flame which burn us light us also a littl and cast some use gleam without but marius no longer even heard these mute counsel of passion he never said to himself what if i were to go to such a place what if i were to tri such and such a thing the girl whom he could no longer call ursul was evid somewher noth warn marius in what direct he should seek her his whole life was now sum up in two word absolut uncertainti within an impenetr fog to see her onc again he still aspir to this but he no longer expect it to crown all his poverti had return he felt that ici breath close to him on his heel in the midst of his torment and long befor this he had discontinu his work and noth is more danger than discontinu work it is a habit which vanish a habit which is easi to get rid of and difficult to take up again a certain amount of dream is good like a narcot in discreet dose it lull to sleep the fever of the mind at labor which are sometim sever and produc in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor which correct the over harsh contour of pure thought fill in gap here and there bind togeth and round off the angl of the idea but too much dream sink and drown woe to the brain worker who allow himself to fall entir from thought into reveri he think that he can re ascend with equal eas and he tell himself that after all it is the same thing error thought is the toil of the intellig reveri it voluptu to replac thought with reveri is to confound a poison with a food marius had begun in that way as the reader will rememb passion had superven and had finish the work of precipit him into chimaera without object or bottom one no longer emerg from one self except for the purpos of go off to dream idl product tumultu and stagnant gulf and in proport as labor diminish need increas this is a law man in a state of

heart the more it has disappear the more it beam the gloomi and despair soul see this light on it horizon the star of the inner night shethat was marius whole thought he medit of noth els he was confus conscious that his old coat was becom an imposs coat and that his new coat was grow old that his shirt were wear out that his hat was wear out that his boot were give out and he said to himself if i could but see her onc again befor i die one sweet idea alon was left to him that she had love him that her glanc had told him so that she did not know his name but that she did know his soul and that wherev she was howev mysteri the place she still love him perhap who know whether she were not think of him as he was think of her sometim in those inexplic hour such as are experienc by everi heart that love though he had no reason for anyth but sad and yet felt an obscur quiver of joy he said to himself it is her thought that are come to me then he ad perhap my thought reach her also this illus at which he shook his head a moment later was suffici nevertheless to throw beam which at time resembl hope into his soul from time to time especi at that even hour which is the most depress to even the dreami he allow the purest the most imperson the most ideal of the reveri which fill his brain to fall upon a notebook which contain noth els he call this write to her it must not be suppos that his reason was derang quit the contrari he had lost the faculti of work and of move firm toward ani fix goal but he was endow with more clear sighted and rectitud than ever marius survey by a calm and real although peculiar light what pass befor his eye even the most indiffer deed and men he pronounc a just critic on everyth with a sort of honest deject and candid disinterested his judgment which was almost wholli disassoci from hope held itself aloof and soar on high in this state of mind noth escap him noth deceiv him and everi moment he was discov the foundat of life of human and of destini happi even in the midst of anguish is he to whom god has given a soul worthi of love and of unhappi he who has not view the thing of this world and the heart of man under this doubl light has seen noth and know noth of the true the soul which love and suffer is in a state of sublim howev day follow day and noth new present itself it mere seem to him that the sombr space which still remain to be travers by him was grow shorter with everi instant he thought that he alreadi distinct perceiv the brink of the bottomless abyss what he repeat to himself shall i not see her again befor then when you have ascend the rue saint jacqu left the barrier on one side and follow the old inner boulevard for some distanc you reach the rue de la sant then the glacier and a littl while befor arriv at the littl river of the gobelin you come to a sort of field which is the onli spot in the long and monoton chain of the boulevard of pari where ruysdeel would be tempt to sit down there

fact encount eponin as she stood on the watch under the tree of the boulevard and had led her off prefer to play nemorin with the daughter rather than schinderhann with the father it was well that he

and found themselv at break of day near the barrier du main it was not dawn it was daybreak a delight and stern moment a few constel here and there in the deep pale azur the earth all black the heaven all white a quiver amid the blade of grass everywher the mysteri chill of twilight a lark which seem mingl with the star was carol at a prodigi height and one would have declar that that hymn of petti calm immens in the east the vald grace project it dark mass on the clear horizon with the sharp of steel venus dazzl brilliant was rise behind that dome and had the air of a soul make it escap from a gloomi edific all was peac and silenc there was no one on the road a few stray labor of whom they caught bare a glimps were on their way to their work along the side path jean valjean was sit in a cross walk on some plank deposit at the gate of a timber yard his face was turn toward the highway his back toward the light he had forgotten the sun which was on the point of rise he had sunk into one of those profound absorpt in which the mind becom concentr which imprison even the eye and which are equival to four wall there are medit which may be call vertic when one is at the bottom of them time is requir to return to earth jean valjean had plung into one of these reveri he was think of cosett of the happi that was possibl if noth came between him and her of the light with which she fill his life a light which was but the eman of her soul he was almost happi in his reveri cosett who was stand besid him was gaze at the cloud as they turn rosi all at onc cosett exclaim father i should think some one was come yonder jean valjean rais his eye cosett was right the causeway which lead to the ancient barrier du main is a prolong as the reader know of the rue de sevr and is cut at right angl by the inner boulevard at the elbow of the causeway and the boulevard at the spot where it branch they heard a nois which it was difficult to account for at that hour and a sort of confus pile made it appear some shapeless thing which was come from the boulevard was turn into the road it grew larger it seem to move in an order manner though it was bristl and quiver it seem to be a vehicl but it load could not be distinct made out there were hors wheel shout whip were crack by degre the outlin becam fix although bath in shadow it was a vehicl in fact which had just turn from the boulevard into the highway and which was direct it cours toward the barrier near which sat jean valjean a second of the same aspect follow then a third then a fourth seven chariot made their appear in success the head of the hors touch the rear of the wagon in front figur were move on these vehicl flash were visibl through the dusk as though there were nake sword there a clank becam audibl which resembl the rattl of chain and as this someth advanc the sound of voic wax louder and it turn into a terribl thing such as emerg from the cave of dream as it drew nearer it assum a form and was outlin behind the tree with the pallid hue of an apparit the mass grew white the day which was slowli dawn cast a wan light on this swarm heap which was at onc both sepulchr and live the head of the figur turn into the face of corps and this is what it prove to be seven wagon were drive in a file along the road the first six were singular construct they resembl cooper dray they consist of long ladder place on two wheel and form barrow at their rear extrem each dray or rather let us say each ladder was attach to four hors har tandem on these ladder strang cluster of men were be drawn in the faint light these men were to be divin rather than seen twenti four on each vehicl twelv on a side back to back face the passer by their leg dangl in the airthi was the manner in which these men were travel and behind their back they had someth which clank and which was a chain and on their neck someth which shone and which was an iron collar each man had his collar but the chain was for all so that if these four and twenti men had occas to alight from the dray and walk they were seiz with a sort of inexor uniti and were oblig to wind over the ground with the chain for a backbon somewhat after the fashion of millep in the back and front of each vehicl two men arm with musket stood erect each hold one end of the chain under his foot the iron necklet were squar the seventh vehicl a huge rack side baggag wagon without a hood had four wheel and six hors and carri a sonor pile of iron boiler cast iron pot brazier and chain among which were mingl sever men who were pinion and stretch at full length and who seem to be ill this wagon all lattic work was garnish with dilapid hurdl which appear to have serv for former punish these vehicl kept to the middl of the road on each side march a

half blue which were almost hang in rag with red epaulet yellow shoulder belt short sabr musket and cudgel they were a speci of soldier blackguard these myrmidon seem compos of the abject of the beggar and the author of the execution the one who appear to be their chief held a postilion whip in his hand all these detail blur by the dim of dawn becam more and more clear outlin as the light increas at the head and in the rear of the convoy rode mount gendarm serious and with sword in fist this process was so long that when the first vehicl reach the barrier the last was bare debauch from the boulevard a throng sprung it is imposs to say whenc and form in a twinkl as is frequent the case in pari press forward from both side of the road and look on in the neighbor lane the shout of peopl call to each other and the wooden shoe of market garden hasten up to gaze were audibl the men mass upon the dray allow themselv to be jolt along in silenc they were livid with the chill of morn they all wore linen trouser and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoe the rest of their costum was a fantasi of wretched their accoutr were horribl incongru noth is more funer than the

hairi breast were visibl and through the rent in their garment tattoo design could be descri templ of love flame heart cupid erupt and unhealthi red blotch could also be seen two or three had a straw rope attach to the cross bar of the dray and suspend under them like a stirrup which support their feet one of them held in his hand and rais to his mouth someth which had the appear of a black stone and which he seem to be gnaw it was bread which he was eat there were no eye there which were not either dri dull or flame with an evil light the escort troop curs the men in chain did not utter a syllabl from time to time the sound of a blow becam audibl as the cudgel descend on shoulder blade or skull some of these men were yawn their rag were terribl their feet hung down their shoulder oscil their head clash togeth their fetter clank their eye glare feroci their fist clench or fell open inert like the hand of corps in the rear of the convoy ran a band of children scream with laughter this file of vehicl whatev it natur was was mourn it was evid that to morrow that an hour henc a pour rain might descend that it might be follow by anoth and anoth and that their dilapid garment would be drench that onc soak these men would not get dri again that onc chill they would not again get warm that their linen trouser would be glu to their bone by the downpour that the water would fill their shoe that no lash from the whip would be abl to prevent their jaw from chatter that the chain would continu to bind them by the neck that their leg would continu to dangl and it was imposs not to shudder at the sight of these human be thus bound and passiv beneath the cold cloud of autumn and deliv over to the rain to the blast to all the furi of the air like tree and stone blow from the

that he was no longer in the new build but that he was still in great danger thenardi on reach the roof of the new build had found the remain of brujon rope hang to the bar of the upper trap of the chimney but as this broken fragment was much too short he had not been abl to escap by the outer wall as brujon and guelem had done when one turn from the rue des ballet into the rue du roi de sicil one almost immedi encount a repuls ruin there stood on that spot in the last centuri a hous of which onli the back wall now remain a regular wall of masonri which rise to the height of the third stori

hall which is like a citi within a citi through which run the rue saint deni and saint martin where a thousand lane cross and of which the insurg had made their redoubt and their stronghold would have appear to him like a dark and enorm caviti hollow out in the centr of pari there the glanc fell into an abyss thank to the broken lantern thank to the close window there all radianc all life all sound

abov which in motionless and melancholi outlin rose the tower of saint jacqu the church of saint merri and two or three more of those grand edific of which man make giant and the night make phantom all around this desert and disquiet labyrinth in the quarter where the parisian circul had not been annihil and where a few street lantern still burn the aerial observ might have distinguish the metal gleam of sword and bayonet the dull rumbl of artilleri and the swarm of silent battalion whose rank were swell from minut to minut a formid girdl which was slowli draw in and around the insurrect the

shudder befor those who were come invis combat were entrench at everi corner of the street snare of the sepulchr conceal in the densiti of night all was over no more light was to be hope for henceforth except the lightn of gun no further encount except the abrupt and rapid apparit of death where how when no one knew but it was certain and inevit in this place which had been mark out for the struggl the govern and the insurrect the nation guard and popular societi the bourgeoi and the upris grope their way were about to come into contact the necess was the same for both the onli possibl issu thenceforth was to emerg thenc kill or conqueror a situat so extrem an obscur so power that the most timid felt themselv seiz with resolut and the most dare with terror moreov on both side the furi the rage and the determin were equal for the one parti to advanc meant death and no one dream of retreat for the other to remain meant death and no one dream of flight it was indispens that all should be end on the follow day that triumph should rest either here or there that the insurrect should prove itself a revolut or a skirmish the govern understood this as well as the parti the most insignific bourgeoi felt it henc a thought of anguish which mingl with the impenetr gloom of this quarter where all was at the point of be decid henc a redoubl anxieti around that silenc

the star had disappear heavi cloud fill the horizon with their melancholi fold a black sky rest on these dead street as though an immens wind sheet were be outspread over this immens tomb while a

utter to a dull roar a fear and sacr voic which is compos of the roar of the brute and of the word of god which terrifi the weak and which warn the wise which come both from below like the voic of the

would have said that the glacial peac of the sepulchr had sprung forth from the earth and had spread over the heaven nevertheless a red glow brought out against this black background the lofti roof of the hous which bar the rue de la chanvreri on the saint eustach side it was the reflect of the torch which was burn in the corinth barricad marius direct his step toward that red light it had drawn him to the march aux poire and he caught a glimps of the dark mouth of the rue des precheur he enter it the insurg sentinel who was guard the other end did not see him he felt that he was veri close to that which he had come in search of and he walk on tipto in this manner he reach the elbow of that short section of the rue mondetour which was as the reader will rememb the onli communic which enjolra had preserv with the outsid world at the corner of the last hous on his left he thrust his head forward and look into the fragment of the rue mondetour a littl beyond the angl of the lane and the rue de la chanvreri which cast a broad curtain of shadow in which he was himself engulf he perceiv some light on the pavement a bit of the wine shop and beyond a flicker lamp within a sort of shapeless wall and men crouch down with gun on their knee all this was ten fathom distant from him it was the interior of the barricad the hous which border the lane on the right conceal the rest of the wine shop the larg barricad and the flag from him marius had but a step more to take then the unhappi young man seat himself on a post fold his arm and fell to think about his father he thought of that heroic colonel pontmerci who had been so proud a soldier who had guard the frontier of franc under the republ and had touch the frontier of asia under napoleon who had beheld genoa alexandria milan turin madrid vienna dresden berlin moscow who had left on all the victori battl field of europ drop of that same blood which he marius had in his vein who had grown gray befor his time in disciplin and command who had live with his sword belt buckl his epaulet fall on his breast his cockad blacken with powder his brow furrow with his helmet in barrack in camp in the bivouac in ambul and who at the expir of twenti year had return from the great war with a scar cheek a smile counten tranquil admir pure as a child have done everyth for franc and noth against her he said to himself that his day had also come now that his hour had struck that follow his father he too was about to show himself brave intrepid bold to run to meet the bullet to offer his breast to bayonet to shed his blood to seek the enemi to seek death that he was about to wage war in his turn and descend to the field of battl and that the field of battl upon which he was to descend was the street and that the war in which he was about to engag was civil war he beheld civil war laid open like a gulf befor him and into this he was about to fall then he shudder he thought of his father sword which his grandfath had sold to a second hand dealer and which he had so mourn regret he said to himself that that chast and valiant sword had done well to escap from him and to depart in wrath into the gloom that if it had thus fled it was becaus it was intellig and becaus it had foreseen the futur that it had had a presenti of this rebellion the war of the gutter the war of the pavement fusillad through cellar window blow given and receiv in the rear it was becaus come from marengo and friedland it did not wish to go to the rue de la chanvreri it was becaus after what it had done with the father it did not wish to do this for the son he told himself that if that sword were there if after take possess of it at his father pillow he had dare to take it and carri it off for this combat of dark between frenchmen in the street it would assur have scorch his hand and burst out aflam befor his eye like the sword of the angel he told himself that it was fortun that it was not there and that it had disappear that that was well that that was just that his grandfath had been the true guardian of his father glori and that it was far better that the colonel sword should be sold at auction sold to the old cloth man thrown among the old junk than that it should to day wound the side of his countri and then he fell to weep bitter this was horribl but what was he to do live without cosett he could not sinc she was gone he must need die had he not given her his word of honor that he would die she had gone know that this meant that it pleas her that marius should die and then it was clear that she no longer love him sinc she had depart thus without warn without a word without a letter although she knew his address what was the good of live and whi should he live now and then what should he retreat after go so far should he flee from danger after have approach it should he slip away after have come and peep into the barricad slip away all in a trembl say after all i have had enough of it as it is i have seen it that suffic this is civil war and i shall take my leav should he abandon his friend who were expect him who were in need of him possibl who were a mere hand against an armi should he be untru at onc to his love to countri to his word should he give to his cowardic the pretext of patriot but this was imposs and if the phantom of his father was there in the gloom and beheld him retreat he would beat him on the loin with the flat of his sword and shout to him march on you poltroon thus a prey to the conflict movement of his thought he drop his head all at onc he rais it a sort of splendid rectif had just been effect in his mind there is a widen of the sphere of thought which is peculiar to the vicin of the grave it make one see clear to be near death the vision of the action into which he felt that he was perhap on the point of enter appear to him no more as lament but as superb the war of the street was sudden transfigur by some unfathom inward work of his soul befor the eye of his thought all the tumultu interrog point of reveri recur to him in throng but without troubl him he left none of them unansw let us see whi should his father be indign are there not case where insurrect rise to the digniti of duti what was there that was degrad for the son of colonel pontmerci in the combat which was about to begin it is no longer montmirail nor champaubert it is someth quit differ the question is no longer one of sacr territorybut of a holi idea the countri wail that may be but human applaud but is it true that the countri doe wail franc bleed but liberti smile and in the presenc of liberti smile franc forget her wound and then if we look at thing from a still more lofti point of view whi do we speak of civil war civil warwhat doe that mean is there a foreign war is not all war between men war between brother war is qualifi onli by it object there is no such thing as foreign or civil war there is onli just and unjust war until

becaus of all the tortur which he had undergon in the cours of this long inquisit to which destini had doom him this was the most terribl never had such pincer seiz him hitherto he felt the mysteri stir of all his latent sensibl he felt the pluck at the strang chord ala the suprem trial let us say rather the onli trial is the loss of the belov be poor old jean valjean certain did not love cosett otherwis than as a father but we have alreadi remark abov that into this patern the widowhood of his life had introduc all the shade of love he love cosett as his daughter and he love her as his mother and he love her as his sister and as he had never had either a woman to love or a wife as natur is a creditor who accept no protest that sentiment also the most imposs to lose was mingl with the rest vagu ignor pure with the puriti of blind unconsci celesti angel divin less like a sentiment than like an instinct less like an instinct than like an impercept and invis but real attract and love proper speak was in his immens tender for cosett like the thread of gold in the mountain conceal and virgin let the reader recal the situat of heart which we have alreadi indic no marriag was possibl between them not even that of soul and yet it is certain that their destini were wed with the except of cosett that is to say with the except of a childhood jean valjean had never in the whole of his long life known anyth of that which may be love the passion and love which succeed each other had not produc in him those success green growth tender green or dark green which can be seen in foliag which pass through the winter and in men who pass fifti in short and we have insist on it more than onc all this interior fusion all this whole of which the sum total was a lofti virtu end in render jean valjean a father to cosett a strang father forg from the grandfath the son the brother and the husband that exist in jean valjean a father in whom there was includ even a mother a father who love cosett and ador her and who held that child as his light his home his famili his countri his paradis thus when he saw that the end had absolut come that she was escap from him that she was slip from his hand that she was glide from him like a cloud like water when he had befor his eye this crush proof anoth is the goal of her heart anoth is the wish of her life there is a dearest one i am no longer anyth but her father i no longer exist when he could no longer doubt when he said to himself she is go away from me the grief which he felt surpass the bound of possibl to have done all that he had done for the purpos of end like this and the veri idea of be noth then as we have just said a quiver of revolt ran through him from head to foot he felt even in the veri root of his hair the immens reawaken of egot and the i in this man abyss howl there is such a thing as the sudden give way of the inward subsoil a despair certainti doe not make it way into a man without thrust asid

emerg from them still like ourselv and firm in duti when the limit of endur is overstep the most imperturb virtu is disconcert jean valjean took the blotter again and convinc himself afresh he remain bow and as though petrifi and with stare eye over those four unobjection line and there aros within him such a cloud that one might have thought that everyth in this soul was crumbl away he examin this revel athwart the exagger of reveri with an appar and terrifi calm for it is a fear thing when a man calm reach the cold of the statu he measur the terribl step which his destini had taken without his have a suspicion of the fact he recal his fear of the preced summer so foolish dissip he recogn the precipic it was still the same onli jean valjean was no longer on the brink he was at the bottom of it the unpreced and heart rend thing about it was that he had fallen without perceiv it all the light of his life had depart while he still fanci that he beheld the sun his instinct did not hesit he put togeth certain circumst certain date certain blush and certain pallor on cosett part and he said to himself it is he the divin of despair is a sort of mysteri bow which never miss it aim he struck marius with his first conjectur he did not know the name but he found the man instant he distinct perceiv in the background of the implac conjur of his memori the unknown prowler of the luxembourg that wretch seeker of love adventur that idler of romanc that idiot that coward for it is coward to come and make eye at young girl who have besid them a father who love them after he had

hair is black when the head is erect on the bodi like the flame on the torch when the roll of destini still retain it full thick when the heart full of desir love still possess beat which can be return to it when one has time for redress when all women and all smile and all the futur and all the horizon are befor one when the forc of life is complet what is it in old age when the year hasten on grow ever paler to that twilight hour when one begin to behold the star of the tomb while he was medit toussaint enter jean valjean rose and ask her in what quarter is it do you know toussaint was

a manner that the artilleri men should not see it that done they await the next discharg of grape shot it was not long in come the cannon vomit forth it packag of buck shot with a roar but there was no rebound the effect which they had foreseen had been attain the barricad was save citizen said enjolra to jean valjean the republ thank you bossuet admir and laugh he exclaim it is immor that a

greater than washington and pisacan is greater than garibaldi it certain is necessari that some one should take the part of the vanquish we are unjust toward these great men who attempt the futur when they fail revolutionist are accus of sow fear abroad everi barricad seem a crime their theori are incrimin their aim suspect their ulterior motiv is fear their conscienc denounc they are reproach with rais erect and heap up against the reign social state a mass of miseri of grief of iniqu of wrong of despair and of tear from the lowest depth block of shadow in order therein to embattl themselv and to combat peopl shout to them you are tear up the pavement of hell they might repli that is becaus our barricad is made of good intent the best thing assur is the pacif solut in short let us agre that when we behold the pavement we think of the bear and it is a good will which render societi uneasi but it depend on societi to save itself it is to it own good will that we make our appeal no violent remedi is necessari to studi evil amiabl to prove it exist then to cure it it is to this that we invit it howev that may be even when fallen abov all when fallen these men who at everi point of the univers with their eye fix on franc are strive for the grand work with the inflex logic of the ideal are august they give their life a free offer to progress they accomplish the will of provid they perform a religi act at the appoint hour with as much disinterested as an actor who answer to his cue in obedi to the divin stage manag they enter the tomb and this hopeless combat this stoical disappear they accept in order to bring about the suprem and univers consequ the magnific and irresist human movement begun on the 14th of juli 1789 these soldier are priest the french revolut is an act of god moreov there are and it is proper to add this distinct to the distinct alreadi point out in anoth chapterther are accept revolut revolut which are call revolut there are refus revolut which are call riot an insurrect which break out is an idea which is pass it examin befor the peopl if the peopl let fall a black ball the idea is dri fruit the insurrect is a mere skirmish wage war at everi summon and everi time that utopia desir it is not the thing for the peopl nation have not alway and at everi hour the tempera of hero and martyr they are posit a priori insurrect is repugn to them in the first place becaus it often result in a catastroph in the second place becaus it alway has an abstract as it point of departur becaus and this is a nobl thing it is alway for the ideal and for the ideal alon that those who sacrific themselv do thus sacrific themselv an insurrect is an enthusiasm enthusiasm may wax wroth henc the appeal to arm but everi insurrect which aim at a govern or a regim aim higher thus for instanc and we insist upon it what the chief of the insurrect of 1832 and in particular the young enthusiast of the rue de la chanvreri were combat was not precis loui philipp the major of them when talk freeli did justic to this king who stood midway between monarchi and revolut no one hate him but they attack the younger branch of the divin right in loui philipp as they had attack it elder branch in charl x and that which they wish to overturn in overturn royalti in franc was as we have explain the usurp of man over man and of privileg over right in the entir univers pari without a king has as result the world without despot this is the manner in which they reason their aim was distant no doubt vagu perhap and it retreat in the face of their effort but it was great thus it is and we sacrific ourselv for these vision which are almost alway illus for the sacrif but illus with which after all the whole of human certainti is mingl we throw ourselv into these tragic affair and becom intox with that which we are about to do who know we may succeed we are few in number we have a whole armi array against us but we are defend right the natur law the sovereignti of each one over himself from which no abdic is possibl justic and truth and in case of need we die like the three hundr spartan we do not think of don quixot but of leonida and we march straight befor us and onc pledg we do not draw back and we rush onward with head held low cherish as our hope an unpreced victori revolut complet progress set free again the aggrandiz of the human race univers deliver and in the event of the worst thermopyla these passag of arm for the sake of progress often suffer shipwreck and we have just explain whi the crowd is restiv in the presenc of the

jean valjean leap forward with the agil of a tiger fell upon him as on his prey and bore him off the whirlwind of the attack was at that moment so violent concentr upon enjolra and upon the door of

where are to be found vestig of all cataclysm from the shell of the delug to the rag of marat book thirdmud but the soul chapter ith sewer and it surpris it was in the sewer of pari that jean valjean found himself still anoth resembl between pari and the sea as in the ocean the diver may disappear there the transit was an unheard of one in the veri heart of the citi jean valjean had escap from the citi and in the twinkl of an eye in the time requir to lift the cover and to replac it he had pass from broad daylight to complet obscur from midday to midnight from tumult to silenc from the whirlwind of thunder to the stagnat of the tomb and by a vicissitud far more tremend even than that of the rue polonceau from the most extrem peril to the most absolut obscur an abrupt fall into a cavern a disappear into the secret trap door of pari to quit that street where death was on everi side for that sort of sepulchr where there was life was a strang instant he remain for sever second as though bewild listen stupefi the wast trap of safeti had sudden yawn beneath him celesti good had in a manner captur him by treacheri ador ambuscad of provid onli the wound man did not stir and jean valjean did not know whether that which he was carri in that grave was a live be or a dead corps his first sensat was one of blind all of a sudden he could see noth it seem to him too that in one instant he had becom deaf he no longer heard anyth the frantic storm of murder which had been let loos a few feet abov his head did not reach him thank to the thick of the earth which separ him from it as we have said otherwis than faint and indistinct and like a rumbl in the depth he felt that the ground was solid under his feet that was all but that was enough he extend one arm and then the other touch the wall on both side and perceiv that the passag was narrow he slip and thus perceiv that the pavement was wet he cautious put forward one foot fear a hole a sink some gulf he discov that the pave continu a gust of fetid inform him of the place in which he stood after the laps of a few minut he was no longer blind a littl light fell through the man hole through which he had descend and his eye becam accustom to this cavern he began to distinguish someth the passag in which he had burrowedno other word can better express the situationwa wall in behind him it was one of those blind alley which the special jargon term branch in front of him there was anoth wall a wall like night the light of the air hole die out ten or twelv pace from the point where jean valjean stood and bare cast a wan pallor on a few metr of the damp wall of the sewer beyond the opaqu was massiv to penetr thither seem horribl an entranc into it appear like an engulf a man could howev plung into that wall of fog and it was necessari so to do hast was even requisit it occur to jean valjean that the grate which he had caught sight of under the flag stone might also catch the eye of the soldieri and that everyth hung upon this chanc they also might descend into that well and search it there was not a minut to be lost he had deposit marius on the ground he pick him up againthat is the real word for itplac him on his shoulder onc more and set out he plung resolut into the gloom the truth is that they were less safe than jean valjean fanci peril of anoth sort and no less serious were await them perchanc after the lightn charg whirlwind of the combat the cavern of miasma and trap after chao the sewer jean valjean had fallen from one circl of hell into anoth when he had advanc fifti pace he was oblig to halt a problem present itself the passag termin in anoth gut which he encount across his path there two way present themselv which should he take ought he to turn to the left or to the right how was he to find his bear in that black labyrinth this labyrinth to which we have alreadi call the reader attent has a clue which is it slope to follow to the slope is to arriv at the river this jean valjean instant comprehend he said to himself that he was probabl in the sewer des hall that if he were to choos the path to the left and follow the slope he would arriv in less than a quarter of an hour at some mouth on the sein between the pont au chang and the pont neuf that is to say he would make his appear in broad daylight on the most dens peopl spot in pari perhap he would come out on some man hole at the intersect of street amaz of the passer by at behold two bleed men emerg from the earth at their feet arriv of the polic a call to arm of the neighbor post of guard thus they would be seiz befor they had even got out it would be better to plung into that labyrinth to confid themselv to that black gloom and to trust to provid for the outcom he ascend the inclin and turn to the right when he had turn the angl of the galleri the distant glimmer of an air hole disappear the curtain of obscur fell upon him onc more and he becam blind again nevertheless he advanc as rapid as possibl marius two arm were pass round his neck and the former feet drag behind him he held both these arm with one hand and grope along the wall with the other marius cheek touch his and clung there bleed he felt a warm stream which came from marius trickl down upon him and make it way under his cloth but a humid warmth near his ear which the mouth of the wound man touch indic respir and consequ life the passag along which jean valjean was now proceed was not so narrow as the first jean valjean walk through it with consider difficulti the rain of the preced day had not as yet entir run off and it creat a littl torrent in the centr of the bottom and he was forc to hug the wall in order not to have his feet in the water thus he proceed in the gloom he resembl the be of the night grope in the invis and lost beneath the earth in vein of shadow still littl by littl whether it was that the distant air hole emit a littl waver light in this opaqu gloom or whether his eye had becom accustom to the obscur some vagu vision return to him and he began onc more to gain a confus idea now of the wall which he touch now of the vault beneath which he was pass the pupil dilat in the dark and the soul dilat in misfortun and end by find god there it was not easi to direct his cours the line of the sewer re echo so to speak the line of the street which lie abov it there were then in pari two thousand two hundr street let the reader imagin himself beneath that forest of gloomi branch which is call the sewer the system of sewer exist at that epoch place end to end would have given a length of eleven leagu we have said abov that the actual net work thank to the special activ of the last thirti year was no less than sixti leagu in extent jean valjean began by commit a blunder he thought that he was beneath the rue saint deni and it was a piti that it was not so under the rue saint deni there is an old stone sewer which date from loui xiii and which run straight to the collect sewer call the grand sewer with but a singl elbow on the right on the elev of the ancient cour des miracl and a singl branch the saint martin sewer whose four arm describ a cross but the gut of the petit truanderi the entranc to which was in the vicin of the corinth wine shop has never communic with the sewer of the rue saint deni it end at the montmartr sewer and it was in this that jean valjean was entangl there opportun of lose oneself abound the montmartr sewer is one of the most labyrinthin of the ancient network fortun jean valjean had left behind him the sewer of the market whose geometr plan present the appear of a multitud of parrot roost pile on top of each other but he had befor him more than one embarrass encount and more than one street cornerfor they are streetspres itself in the gloom like an interrog point first on his left the vast sewer of the platrier a sort of chines puzzl thrust out and entangl it chao of ts and zs under the post offic and under the rotunda of the wheat market as far as the sein where it termin in a y second on his right the curv corridor of the rue du cadran with it three teeth which are also blind court third on his left the branch of the mail complic almost at it incept with a sort of fork and proceed from zig zag to zig zag until it end in the grand crypt of the outlet of the louvr truncat and ramifi in everi direct and last the blind alley of a passag of the rue des jeuneur without count littl duct here and there befor reach the belt sewer which alon could conduct him to some issu suffici distant to be safe had jean valjean had ani idea of all that we have here point out he would speedili have perceiv mere by feel the wall that he was not in the subterranean galleri of the rue saint deni instead of the ancient stone instead of the antiqu architectur haughti and royal even in the sewer with pavement and string cours of granit and mortar cost eight hundr livr the fathom he would have felt under his hand contemporari cheap econom expedi porous stone fill with mortar on a concret foundat which cost two hundr franc the metr and the bourgeois masonri known as a petit materiauxsmal stuff but of all this he knew noth he advanc with anxieti but with calm see noth know noth buri in chanc that is to say engulf in provid by degre we will admit a certain horror seiz upon him the gloom which envelop him penetr his spirit he walk in an enigma this aqueduct of the sewer is formid it interlac in a dizzi fashion it is a melancholi thing to be caught in this pari of shadow jean valjean was oblig to find and even to invent his rout without see it in this unknown everi step that he risk might be his last how was he to get out should he find an issu should he find it in time would that coloss subterranean spong with it stone caviti allow itself to be penetr and pierc should he there encount some unexpect knot in the dark should he arriv at the inextric and the impass would marius die there of hemorrhag and he of hunger should they end by both get lost and by furnish two skeleton in a nook of that night he did not know he put all these question to himself without repli to them the intestin of pari form a precipic like the prophet he was in the belli of the monster all at onc he had a surpris at the most unforeseen moment and without have ceas to walk in a straight line he perceiv that he was no longer ascend the water of the rivulet was beat against his heel instead of meet him at his toe the sewer was now descend whi was he about to arriv sudden at the sein this danger was a great one but the peril of retreat was still greater he continu to advanc it was not toward the sein that he was proceed the ridg which the soil of pari form on it right bank empti one of it water shed into the sein and the other into the grand sewer the crest of this ridg which determin the divis of the water describ a veri caprici line the culmin point which is the point of separ of the current is in the saint avoy sewer beyond the rue michell comt in the sewer of the louvr near the boulevard and in the montmartr sewer near the hall it was this culmin point that jean valjean had reach he was direct his cours toward the belt sewer he was on the right path but he did not know it everi time that he encount a branch he felt of it angl and if he found that the open which present itself was smaller than the passag in which he was he did not enter but continu his rout right judg that everi narrow way must need termin in a blind alley and could onli lead him further from his goal that is to say the outlet thus he avoid the quadrupl trap which was set for him in the dark by the four labyrinth which we have just enumer at a certain moment he perceiv that he was emerg from beneath the pari which was petrifi by the upris where the barricad had suppress circul and that he was enter beneath the live and normal pari overhead he sudden heard a nois as of thunder distant but continu it was the rumbl of vehicl he had been walk for about half an hour at least accord to the calcul which he made in his own mind and he had not yet thought of rest he had mere chang the hand with which he was hold marius the dark was more profound than ever but it veri depth reassur him all at onc he saw his shadow in front of him it was outlin on a faint almost indistinct reddish glow which vagu empurpl the floor vault underfoot and the vault overhead and gild to his right and to his left the two viscous wall of the passag stupefi he turn round behind him in the portion of the passag which he had just pass through at a distanc which appear to him immens pierc the dens obscur flame a sort of horribl star which had the air of survey him it was the gloomi star of the polic which was rise in the sewer in the rear of that star eight or ten form were move about in a confus way black upright indistinct horribl chapter iiexplan on the day of the sixth of june a battu of the

which exact a doubl strategi on the part of the public forc repres abov by the armi and below by the polic three squad of agent and sewermen explor the subterranean drain of pari the first on the right bank the second on the left bank the third in the citi the agent of polic were arm with carabin with bludgeon sword and poignard that which was direct at jean valjean at that moment was the lantern of the patrol of the right bank this patrol had just visit the curv galleri and the three blind alley which lie beneath the rue du cadran while they were pass their lantern through the depth of these blind alley jean valjean had encount on his path the entranc to the galleri had perceiv that it was narrow than the princip passag and had not penetr thither he had pass on the polic on emerg from the galleri du cadran had fanci that they heard the sound of footstep in the direct of the belt sewer they were in fact the step of jean valjean the sergeant in command of the patrol had rais his lantern and the squad had begun to gaze into the mist in the direct whenc the sound proceed this was an indescrib moment for jean valjean happili if he saw the lantern well the lantern saw him but ill it was light and he was shadow he was veri far off and mingl with the dark of the place he hug the wall and halt moreov he did not understand what it was that was move behind him the lack of sleep and food and his emot had caus him also to pass into the state of a visionari he beheld a gleam and around that gleam form what was it he did not comprehend jean valjean have paus the sound ceas the men of the patrol listen and heard noth they look and saw noth they held a consult there exist at that epoch at this point of the montmartr sewer a sort of cross road call de servic which was afterward suppress on account of the littl interior lake which form there swallow up the torrent of rain in heavi storm the patrol could form a cluster in this open space jean valjean saw these spectr form a sort of circl these bull dog head approach each other close and whisper togeth the result of this council held by the watch dog was that they had been mistaken that there had been no nois that it was useless to get entangl in the belt sewer that it would onli be a wast of time but that they ought to hasten toward saint merri that if there was anyth to do and ani bousingot to track out it was in that quarter from time to time parti re sole their old insult in 1832 the word bousingot form the interim between the word jacobin which had becom obsolet and the word demagogu which has sinc render such excel servic the sergeant gave order to turn to the left toward the watersh of the sein if it had occur to them to separ into two squad and to go in both direct jean valjean would have been captur all hung on that thread it is probabl that the instruct of the prefectur forese a possibl of combat and insurg in forc had forbidden the patrol to part compani the patrol resum it march leav jean valjean behind it of all this movement jean valjean perceiv noth except the eclips of the lantern which sudden wheel round befor take his departur the sergeant in order to acquit his policeman

spun a thief without allow himself to be distract by insurrect and barricad it was someth precis parallel which took place on the afternoon of the 6th of june on the bank of the sein on the slope of the right shore a littl beyond the pont des invalid there is no longer ani bank there now the aspect of the local has chang on that bank two men separ by a certain distanc seem to be watch each other while mutual avoid each other the one who was in advanc was tri to get away the one in the rear was tri to overtak the other it was like a game of checker play at a distanc and in silenc neither seem to be in ani hurri and both walk slowli as though each of them fear by too much hast to make his partner redoubl his pace one would have said that it was an appetit follow it prey and purpos without wear the air of do so the prey was crafti and on it guard the proper relat between the hunt pole cat and the hunt dog were observ the one who was seek to escap had an insignific mien and not an

was deepli furious ani one who could have observ him would have discern in his eye the sombr hostil of flight and all the menac that fear contain the shore was desert there were no passer by not even a boatman nor a lighter man was in the skiff which were moor here and there it was not easi to see these two men except from the quay opposit and to ani person who had scrutin them at that distanc the man who was in advanc would have appear like a bristl tatter and equivoc be who was uneasi and trembl beneath a rag blous and the other like a classic and offici personag wear the frock coat of author button to the chin perchanc the reader might recogn these two men if he were to see them closer at hand what was the object of the second man probabl to succeed in cloth the first more warm when a man cloth by the state pursu a man in rag it is in order to make of him a man who is also cloth by the state onli the whole question lie in the color to be dress in blue is glorious to be dress in red is disagre there is a purpl from below it is probabl some unpleas and some purpl of this sort which the first man is desir of shirk if the other allow him to walk on and had not seiz him as yet it was judg from all appear in the hope of see him lead up to some signific meet place and to some group worth catch this delic oper is call spin what render this conjectur entir probabl is that the button up man on catch sight from the shore of a hackney coach on the quay as it was pass along empti made a sign to the driver the driver understood evid recogn the person with whom he had to deal turn about and began to follow the two men at the top of the quay at a foot pace this was not observ by the slouch and tatter personag who was in advanc the hackney coach roll along the tree of the champ elyse the bust of the driver whip in hand could be seen move along abov the parapet one of the secret instruct of the polic author to their agent contain this articl alway have on hand a hackney coach in case of emerg while these two men were manoeuvr each on his own side with irreproach strategi they approach an inclin plane on the quay which descend to the shore and which permit cab driver arriv from passi to come to the river and water their hors this inclin plane was suppress later on for the sake of symmetri hors may die of thirst but the eye is gratifi it is probabl that the man in the blous had intend to ascend this inclin plane with a view to make his escap into the champ elyse a place ornament with tree but in return much infest with policemen and where the other could easili exercis violenc this point on the quay is not veri far distant from the hous brought to pari from moret in 1824 by colonel brack and design as the hous of francoi i a guard hous is situat close at hand to the great surpris of his watcher the man who was be track did not mount by the inclin plane for water he continu to advanc along the quay on the shore his posit was visibl becom critic what was he intend to do if not to throw himself into the sein henceforth there exist no mean of ascend to the quay there was no other inclin plane no staircas and they were near the spot mark by the bend in the sein toward the pont de jena where the bank grow constant narrow end in a slender tongu and was lost in the water there he would inevit find himself block between the perpendicular wall on his right the river on his left and in front of him and the author on his heel it is true that this termin of the shore was hidden from sight by a heap of rubbish six or seven feet in height produc by some demolit or other but did this man hope to conceal himself effectu behind that heap of rubbish which one need but skirt the expedi would have been pueril he certain was not dream of such a thing the innoc of thiev doe not extend to that point the pile of rubbish form a sort of project at the water edg which was prolong in a promontori as far as the wall of the quay the man who was be follow arriv at this littl mound and went round it so that he ceas to be seen by the other the latter as he did not see could not be seen he took advantag of this fact to abandon all dissimul and to walk veri rapid in a few moment he had reach the rubbish heap and pass round it there he halt in sheer amaz the man whom he had been pursu was no longer there total eclips of the man in the blous the shore begin with the rubbish heap was onli about thirti pace long then it plung into the water which beat against the wall of the quay the fugit could not have thrown himself into the sein without be seen by the man who was follow him what had becom of him the man in the button up coat walk to the extrem of the shore and remain there in thought for a moment his fist clench his eye search all at onc he smote his brow he had just perceiv at the point where the land came to an end and the water began a larg iron grate low arch garnish with a heavi lock and with three massiv hing this grate a sort of door pierc at the base of the quay open on the river as well as on the shore a blackish stream pass under it this stream discharg into the sein beyond the heavi rusti iron bar a sort of dark and vault corridor could be descri the man fold his arm and stare at the grate with an air of reproach as this gaze did not suffic he tri to thrust it asid he shook it it resist solid it is probabl that it had just been open although no sound had been heard a singular circumst in so rusti a grate but it is certain that it had been close again this indic that the man befor whom that door had just open had not a hook but a key this evid sudden burst upon the mind of the man who was tri to move the grate and evok from him this indign ejacul that is too much a govern key then immedi regain his composur he express a whole world of interior idea by this outburst of monosyl accent almost iron come come come come that said and in the hope of someth or other either that he should see the man emerg or other men enter he post himself on the watch behind a heap of rubbish with the patient rage of a pointer the hackney coach which regul all it movement on his had in it turn halt on the quay abov him close to the parapet the coachman forese a prolong wait encas his hors muzzl in the bag of oat which is damp at the bottom and which is so familiar to parisian to whom be it said in parenthesi the govern

carriag on the quay chapter ivh also bear his cross jean valjean had resum his march and had not again paus this march becam more and more labori the level of these vault vari the averag height is about five feet six inch and has been calcul for the statur of a man jean valjean was forc to bend over in order not to strike marius against the vault at everi step he had to bend then to rise and to feel incess of the wall the moistur of the stone and the viscous natur of the timber framework furnish but poor support to which to cling either for hand or foot he stumbl along in the hideous dung heap of the citi the intermitt gleam from the air hole onli appear at veri long interv and were so wan that the full sunlight seem like the light of the moon all the rest was mist miasma opaqu black jean valjean was both hungri and thirsti especi thirsti and this like the sea was a place full of water where a man cannot drink his strength which was prodigi as the reader know and which had been but littl decreas by age thank to his chast and sober life began to give way nevertheless fatigu began to gain on him and as his strength decreas it made the weight of his burden increas marius who was perhap dead weigh him down as inert bodi weigh jean valjean held him in such a manner that his chest was not oppress and so that respir could proceed as well as possibl between his leg he felt the rapid glide of the rat one of them was frighten to such a degre that he bit him from time to time a breath of fresh air reach him through the vent hole of the mouth of the sewer and re anim him it might have been three hour past midday when he reach the belt sewer he was at first astonish at this sudden widen he found himself all at onc in a galleri where his outstretch hand could not reach the two wall and beneath a vault which his head did not touch the grand sewer is in fact eight feet wide and seven feet high at the point where the montmartr sewer join the grand sewer two other subterranean galleri that of the rue de provenc and that of the abattoir form a squar between these four way a less sagaci man would have remain undecid jean valjean select the broadest that is to say the belt sewer but here the question again came upshould he descend or ascend he thought that the situat requir hast and that he must now gain the sein at ani risk in other term he must descend he turn to the left it was well that he did so for it is an error to suppos that the belt sewer has two outlet the one in the direct of berci the other toward passi and that it is as it name indic the subterranean girdl of the pari on the right bank the grand sewer which is it must be rememb noth els than the old brook of menilmont termin if one ascend it in a blind sack that is to say at it ancient point of departur which was it sourc at the foot of the knoll of menilmont there is no direct communic with the branch which collect the water of pari begin with the quartier popincourt and which fall into the sein through the amelot sewer abov the ancient isl louvier this branch which complet the collect sewer is separ from it under the rue menilmont itself by a pile which mark the divid point of the water between upstream and downstream if jean valjean had ascend the galleri he would have arriv after a thousand effort and broken down with fatigu and in an expir condit in the gloom at a wall he would have been lost in case of necess by retrac his step a littl way and enter the passag of the fill du calvair on condit that he did not hesit at the subterranean cross of the carrefour boucherat and by take the corridor saint loui then the saint gill gut on the left then turn to the right and avoid the saint sebastian galleri he might have reach the amelot sewer and thenc provid that he did not go astray in the sort of f which lie under the bastill he might have attain the outlet on the sein near the arsenal but in order to do this he must have been thorough familiar with the enorm madrepor of the sewer in all it ramif and in all it open now we must again insist that he knew noth of that fright drain which he was travers and had ani one ask him in what he was he would have answer in the night his instinct serv him well to descend was in fact possibl safeti he left on his right the two narrow passag which branch out in the form of a claw under the rue laffitt and the rue saint georg and the long bifurc corridor of the chausse dantin a littl beyond an affluent which was probabl the madelein branch he halt he was extrem weari a passabl larg air hole probabl the man hole in the rue danjou furnish a light that was almost vivid jean valjean with the gentl of movement which a brother would exercis toward his wound brother deposit marius on the banquett of the sewer marius blood stain face appear under the wan light of the air hole like the ash at the bottom of a tomb his eye were close his hair was plaster down on his templ like a painter brush dri in

the cloth of his coat was chafe the yawn gash in the live flesh jean valjean push asid the garment with the tip of his finger laid his hand upon marius breast his heart was still beat jean valjean tore up his shirt bandag the young man wound as well as he was abl and stop the flow blood then bend over marius who still lay unconsci and almost without breath in that half light he gaze at him with inexpress hatr on disarrang marius garment he had found two thing in his pocket the roll which had been forgotten there on the preced even and marius pocketbook he ate the roll and open the pocketbook on the first page he found the four line written by marius the reader will recal them my name is marius pontmerci carri my bodi to my grandfath m gillenormand rue des fill du calvair no 6 in the marai jean valjean read these four line by the light of the air hole and remain for a moment as though absorb in thought repeat in a low tone rue des fill du calvair number 6 monsieur gillenormand he replac the pocketbook in marius pocket he had eaten his strength had return to him he took marius up onc more upon his back place the latter head care on his right shoulder and resum his descent of the sewer the grand sewer direct accord to the cours of the valley of menilmont is about two leagu long it is pave throughout a notabl portion of it extent this torch of the name of the street of pari with

thisb stop her nose in the presenc of pyramus and say phew chapter vith fonti jean valjean found himself in the presenc of a fonti this sort of quagmir was common at that period in the subsoil of the

passag was effect under the galleri des martyr was by mean of a cast iron pipe when in 1836 the old stone sewer beneath the faubourg saint honor in which we now see jean valjean was demolish for the purpos of reconstruct it the quicksand which form the subsoil of the champ elyse as far as the sein present such an obstacl that the oper last near six month to the great clamor of the dweller on the riversid particular those who had hotel and carriag the work was more than unhealthi it was danger it is true that they had four month and a half of rain and three flood of the sein the fonti which jean valjean had encount was caus by the downpour of the preced day the pavement bad sustain by the subjac sand had given way and had produc a stoppag of the water infiltr had taken place a slip had follow the disloc bottom had sunk into the ooz to what extent imposs to say the obscur was more dens there than elsewher it was a pit of mire in a cavern of night jean valjean felt the pavement vanish beneath his feet he enter this slime there was water on the surfac slime at the bottom he must pass it to retrac his step was imposs marius was die and jean valjean exhaust besid where was he to go jean valjean advanc moreov the pit seem for the first few step not to be veri deep but in proport as he advanc his feet plung deeper soon he had the slime up to his calv and water abov his knee he walk on rais marius in his arm as far abov the water as he could the mire now reach to his knee and the water to his waist he could no longer retreat this mud dens enough for one man could not obvious uphold two marius and jean valjean would have stood a chanc of extric themselv singl jean valjean continu to advanc support the die man who was perhap a corps the water came up to his arm pit he felt that he was sink it was onli with difficulti that he could move in the depth of ooz which he had now reach the densiti which was his support was also an obstacl he still held marius on high and with an unheard of expenditur of forc he advanc still but he was sink he had onli his head abov the water now and his two arm hold up marius in the old paint of the delug there is a mother hold her child thus he sank still deeper he turn his face to the rear to escap the water and in order that he might be abl to breath anyon who had seen him in that gloom would have thought that what he beheld was a mask float on the shadow he caught a faint glimps abov him of the droop head and livid face of marius he made a desper effort and launch his foot forward his foot struck someth solid a point of support it was high time he straighten himself up and root himself upon that point of support with a sort of furi this produc upon him the effect of the first step in a staircas lead back to life the point of support thus encount in the mire at the suprem moment was the begin of the other water shed of the pavement which had bent but had not given way and which had curv under the water like a plank and in a singl piec well built pavement form a vault and possess this sort of firm this fragment of the vault part submerg but solid was a verit inclin plane and onc on this plane he was safe jean valjean mount this inclin plane and reach the other side of the quagmir as he emerg from the water he came in contact with a stone and fell upon his knee he reflect that this was but just and he remain there for some time with his soul absorb in word address to god he rose to his feet shiver chill foul smell bow beneath the die man whom he was drag after him all drip with slime and his soul fill with a strang light chapter viion sometim run aground when one fanci that one is disembark he set out on his way onc more howev although he had not left his life in the fonti he seem to have left his strength behind him there that suprem effort had exhaust him his lassitud was now such that he was oblig to paus for breath everi three or four step and lean against the wall onc he was forc to seat himself on the banquett in order to alter marius posit and he thought that he should have to remain there but if his vigor was dead his energi was not he rose again he walk on desper almost fast proceed thus for a hundr pace almost without draw breath and sudden came in contact with the wall he had reach an elbow of the sewer and arriv at the turn with head bent down he had struck the wall he rais his eye and at the extrem of the vault far veri far away in front of him he perceiv a light this time it was not that terribl light it was good white light it was daylight jean valjean saw the

portal jean valjean was no longer conscious of fatigu he no longer felt marius weight he found his leg onc more of steel he ran rather than walk as he approach the outlet becam more and more distinct defin it was a point arch lower than the vault which gradual narrow and narrow than the galleri which close in as the vault grew lower the tunnel end like the interior of a funnel a faulti construct imit from the wicket of penitentiari logic in a prison illog in a sewer and which has sinc been correct jean valjean reach the outlet there he halt it certain was the outlet but he could not get out the arch was close by a heavi grate and the grate which to all appear rare swung on it rusti hing was clamp to it stone jamb by a thick lock which red with rust seem like an enorm brick the keyhol

which face the grand caillou fli were enter and emerg through the bar of the grate it might have been half past eight oclock in the even the day was declin jean valjean laid marius down along the wall on the dri portion of the vault then he went to the grate and clench both fist round the bar the shock which he gave it was frenzi but it did not move the grate did not stir jean valjean seiz the bar one after the other in the hope that he might be abl to tear away the least solid and to make of it a lever wherewith to rais the door or to break the lock not a bar stir the teeth of a tiger are not more firm fix in their socket no lever no pri possibl the obstacl was invinc there was no mean of open the gate must he then stop there what was he to do what was to becom of him he had not the strength to retrac his step to recomm the journey which he had alreadi taken besid how was he to again travers that quagmir whenc he had onli extric himself as by a miracl and after the quagmir was there not the polic patrol which assur could not be twice avoid and then whither was he to go what direct should he pursu to follow the inclin would not conduct him to his goal if he were to reach

mouth were bar he had onli succeed in escap into a prison all was over everyth that jean valjean had done was useless exhaust had end in failur they were both caught in the immens and gloomi web of death and jean valjean felt the terribl spider run along those black strand and quiver in the shadow he turn his back to the grate and fell upon the pavement hurl to earth rather than seat close to marius who still made no movement and with his head bent between his knee this was the last drop of anguish of what was he think dure this profound depress neither of himself nor of marius he was think of cosett chapter viiith torn coat tail in the midst of this prostrat a hand was laid on his shoulder and a low voic said to him half share some person in that gloom noth so close resembl a

mechan pass the tip of his fore finger across his thumb nail then he lift up his voic all is near over but one last thing remain for me what is it jean valjean struggl with what seem a last hesit and without voic without breath he stammer rather than said now that you know do you think sir you who are the master that i ought not to see cosett ani more i think that would be better repli marius cold i shall never see her more murmur jean valjean and he direct his step toward the door he laid his hand on the knob the latch yield the door open jean valjean push it open far enough to pass through stood motionless for a second then close the door again and turn to marius he was no longer pale he was livid there were no longer ani tear in his eye but onli a sort of tragic flame his voic had

have made i should have gone away but as i desir to remain in the place where cosett is and to continu to see her i had to tell you about it honest you follow my reason do you not it is a matter easili understood you see i have had her with me for more than nine year we live first in that hut on the boulevard then in the convent then near the luxembourg that was where you saw her for the first time you rememb her blue plush hat then we went to the quartier des invalid where there was a rail on a garden the rue plumet i live in a littl back court yard whenc i could hear her piano that was my life we never left each other that last for nine year and some month i was like her own father and she was my child i do not know whether you understand monsieur pontmerci but to go away now never to see her again never to speak to her again to no longer have anyth would be hard if you do not disapprov of it i will come to see cosett from time to time i will not come often i will not remain long you shall give order that i am to be receiv in the littl wait room on the ground floor i could enter perfect well by the back door but that might creat surpris perhap and it would be better i think for me to enter by the usual door truli sir i should like to see a littl more of cosett as rare as you pleas put yourself in my place i have noth left but that and then we must be cautious if i no longer come at all it would produc a bad effect it would be consid singular what i can do by the way is to come in the afternoon when night is begin to fall you shall come everi even said marius and cosett will be wait for you you are kind sir said jean valjean marius salut jean valjean happi escort despair to the door and these two men part chapter iith obscur which a revel can contain marius was quit upset the sort of estrang which he had alway felt toward the man besid whom he had seen cosett was now explain to him there was someth enigmat about that person of which his instinct had warn him this enigma was the most hideous of disgrac the galley this m fauchelev was the convict jean valjean to abrupt find such a secret in the midst of one happi resembl the discoveri of a scorpion in a nest of turtledov was the happi of marius and cosett thenceforth condemn to such a neighborhood was this an accomplish fact did the accept of that man form a part of the marriag now consumm was there noth to be done had marius wed the convict as well in vain may one be crown with light and joy in vain may one tast the grand purpl hour of life happi love such shock would forc even the archangel in his ecstasi even the demigod in his glori to shudder as is alway the case in chang of view of this natur marius ask himself whether he had noth with which to reproach himself had he been want in divin had he been want in prudenc had he involuntarili dull his wit a littl perhap had he enter upon this love affair which had end in his marriag to cosett without take suffici precaut to throw light upon the surround he admittedit is thus by a seri of success admiss of ourselv in regard to ourselv that life amend us littl by littleh admit the chimer and visionari side of his natur a sort of intern cloud peculiar to mani organ and which in paroxysm of passion and sorrow dilat as the temperatur of the soul chang and invad the entir man to such a degre as to render him noth more than a conscienc bath in a mist we have more than onc indic this characterist element of marius individu he recal that in the intox of his love in the rue plumet dure those six or seven ecstat week he had not even spoke to cosett of that drama in the gorbeau hovel where the victim had taken up such a singular line of silenc dure the struggl and the ensu flight how had it happen that he had not mention this to cosett yet it was so near and so terribl how had it come to pass that he had not even name the thenardi and particular on the day when he had encount eponin he now found it almost difficult to explain his silenc of that time nevertheless he could account for it he recal his benumb state his intox with cosett love absorb everyth that catch away of each other into the ideal and perhap also like the impercept quantiti of reason mingl with this violent and charm state of the soul a vagu dull instinct impel him to conceal and abolish in his memori that redoubt adventur contact with which he dread in which he did not wish to play ani part his agenc in which he had kept secret and in which he could be neither narrat nor wit without be an accus moreov these few week had been a flash of lightn there had been no time for anyth except love in short have weigh everyth turn everyth over in his mind examin everyth whatev might have been the consequ if he had told cosett about the gorbeau ambush even if he had discov that jean valjean was a convict would that have chang him marius would that have chang her cosett would he have drawn back would he have ador her ani the less would he have refrain from marri her no then there was noth to regret noth with which he need reproach himself all was well there is a deiti for those drunken men who are call lover marius blind had follow the path which he would have chosen had he been in full possess of his sight love had bandag his eye in order to lead him whither to paradis but this paradis was henceforth complic with an infern accompani marius ancient estrang toward this man toward this fauchelev who had turn into jean valjean was at present mingl with horror in this horror let us state there was some piti and even a certain surpris this thief this thief guilti of a second offenc had restor that deposit and what a deposit six hundr thousand franc he alon was in the secret of that deposit he might have kept it all he had restor it all moreov he had himself reveal his situat noth forc him to this if ani one learn who he was it was through himself in this avow there was someth more than accept of humili there was accept of peril for a condemn man a mask is not a mask it is a shelter a fals name is secur and he had reject that fals name he the galley slave might have hidden himself forev in an honest famili he had withstood this temptat and with what motiv through a conscienti scrupl he himself explain this with the irresist accent of truth in short whatev this jean valjean might be he was undoubt a conscienc which was awaken there exist some mysteri re habilit which had begun and to all appear scrupl had for a long time alreadi control this man such fit of justic and good are not characterist of vulgar natur an awaken of conscienc is grandeur of soul jean valjean was sincer this sincer visibl palpabl irrefrag evid from the veri grief that it caus him render inquiri useless and confer author on all that that man had said here for marius there was a strang revers of situat what breath from m fauchelev distrust what did jean valjean inspir confid in the mysteri balanc of this jean valjean which the pensiv marius struck he admit the activ principl he admit the passiv principl and he tri to reach a balanc but all this went on as in a storm marius while endeavor to form a clear idea of this man and while pursu jean valjean so to speak in the depth of his thought lost him and found him again in a fatal mist the deposit honest restor the probiti of the confessionthes were good this produc a lighten of the cloud then the cloud becam black onc more troubl as were marius memori a shadow of them return to him after all what was that adventur in the jondrett attic whi had that man taken to flight on the arriv of the polic instead of enter a complaint here marius found the answer becaus that man was a fugit from justic who had broken his ban anoth question whi had that man come to the barricad for marius now onc more distinct beheld that recollect which had re appear in his emot like sympathet ink at the applic of heat this man had been in the barricad he had not fought there what had he come there for in the presenc of this question a spectr sprang up and repli javert marius recal perfect now that funer sight of jean valjean drag the pinion javert out of the barricad and he still heard behind the corner of the littl rue mondetour that fright pistol shot obvious there was hatr between that polic spi and the galley slave the one was in the other way jean valjean had gone to the barricad for the purpos of reveng himself he had arriv late he probabl knew that javert was a prison there the corsican vendetta has penetr to certain lower strata and has becom the law there it is so simpl that it doe not astonish soul which are but half turn toward good and those heart are so constitut that a crimin who is in the path of repent may be scrupul in the matter of theft and unscrupul in the matter of vengeanc jean valjean had kill javert at least that seem to be evid this was the final question to be sure but to this there was no repli this question marius felt like pincer how had it come to pass that jean valjean exist had elbow that of cosett for so long a period what melancholi sport of provid was that which had place that child in contact with that man are there then chain for two which are forg on high and doe god take pleasur in coupl the angel with the demon so a crime and an innoc can be room mate in the mysteri galley of wretched in that defil of condemn person which is call human destini can two brow pass side by side the one ingenu the other formid the one all bath in the divin white of dawn the other forev blemish by the flash of an etern lightn who could have arrang that inexplic pair off in what manner in consequ of what prodigi had ani communiti of life been establish between this celesti littl creatur and that old crimin who could have bound the lamb to the wolf and what was still more incomprehens have attach the wolf to the lamb for the wolf love the lamb for the fierc creatur ador the feebl one for dure the space of nine year the angel had had the monster as her point of support cosett childhood and girlhood her advent in the daylight her virgin growth toward life and light had been shelter by that hideous devot here question exfoli so to speak into innumer enigma abyss yawn at the bottom of abyss and marius could no longer bend over jean valjean without becom dizzi what was this man precipic the old symbol of genesi are etern in human societi such as it now exist and until a broader day shall effect a chang in it there will alway be two men the one superior the other subterranean the one which is accord to good is abel the other which is accord to evil is cain what was this tender cain what was this ruffian religi absorb in the ador of a virgin watch over her rear her guard her dignifi her and envelop her impur as he was himself with puriti what was that cess pool which had vener that innoc to such a point as not to leav upon it a singl spot what was this jean valjean educ cosett what was this figur of the shadow which had for it onli object the preserv of the rise of a star from everi shadow and from everi cloud that was jean valjean secret that was also god secret in the presenc of this doubl secret marius recoil the one in some sort reassur him as to the other god was as visibl in this affair as was jean valjean god has his instrument he make use of the tool which he will he is not respons to men do we know how god set about the work jean valjean had labor over cosett he had to some extent made that soul that was incontest well what then the workman was horribl but the work was admir god produc his miracl as seem good to him he had construct that charm cosett and he had employ jean valjean it had pleas him to choos this strang collabor for himself what account have we to demand of him is this the first time that the dung heap has aid the spring to creat the rose marius made himself these repli and declar to himself that they were good he had not dare to press jean valjean on all the point which we have just indic but he did not confess to himself that he did not dare to do it he ador cosett he possess cosett cosett was splendid pure that was suffici for him what enlighten did he need cosett was a light doe light requir enlighten he had everyth what more could he desir alli not that enough jean valjean person affair did not concern him and bend over the fatal shadow of that man he clung fast convuls to the solemn declar of that unhappi wretch i am noth to cosett ten year ago i did not know that she was in exist jean valjean was a passer by he had said so himself well he had pass whatev he was his part was finish henceforth there remain marius to fulfil the part of provid to cosett cosett had sought the azur in a person like

still held to the inexor system though he was a democrat and he entertain all the idea of the law on the subject of those whom the law strike he had not yet accomplish all progress we admit he had not yet come to distinguish between that which is written by man and that which is written by god between law and right he had not examin and weigh the right which man take to dispos of the irrevoc and the irrepar he was not shock by the word vindict he found it quit simpl that certain breach of the written law should be follow by etern suffer and he accept as the process of civil social damnat he

an express whirl what broke forth marius do you disput that these are fact they are chimera the confid with which monsieur le baron honor me render it my duti to tell him so truth and justic befor all thing i do not like to see folk accus unjust monsieur le baron jean valjean did not rob m madelein and jean valjean did not kill javert this is too much how is this for two reason what are they speak this is the first he did not rob m madelein becaus it is jean valjean himself who was m madelein what tale are you tell me and this is the second he did not assassin javert becaus the person who kill javert was javert what do you mean to say that javert commit suicid prove it prove it cri marius besid himself thenardi resum scan his phrase after the manner of the ancient alexandrin measur polic agent ja vert was found drown un der a boat of the pont au chang but prove it thenardi drew from his pocket a larg envelop of gray paper which seem to contain sheet fold in differ size i have my paper he said calm and he ad monsieur le baron in your interest i desir to know jean valjean thorough i say that jean valjean and m madelein are one and the same man and i say that javert had no other
