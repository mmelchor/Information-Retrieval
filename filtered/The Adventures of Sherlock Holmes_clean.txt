as mr john hare alon could have equal it was not mere that holm chang his costum his express his manner his veri soul seem to vari with everi fresh part that he assum the stage lost a fine actor even as scienc lost an acut reason when he becam a specialist in crime it was a quarter past six when we left baker street and it still want ten minut to the hour when we found ourselv in serpentin avenu it was alreadi dusk and the lamp were just be light as we pace up and down in front of brioni lodg wait for the come of it occup the hous was just such as i had pictur it from sherlock holm succinct descript but the local appear to be less privat than i expect on the contrari for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood it was remark anim there was a group of shabbili dress men smoke and laugh in a corner a scissor grinder with his wheel two guardsmen who were flirt with a nurs girl and sever well dress young men who were loung up and down with cigar in their mouth you see remark holm as we pace to and fro in front of the hous this marriag rather simplifi matter the photograph becom a doubl edg weapon now the chanc are that she would be as avers to it be seen by mr godfrey norton as our client is to it come to the eye of his princess now the question is where are we to find the photograph where inde it is most unlik that she carri it about with her it is cabinet size too larg for easi conceal about a woman dress she know that the king is capabl of have her waylaid and search two attempt of the sort have alreadi been made we may take it then that she doe not carri it about with her where then her banker or her lawyer there is that doubl possibl but i am inclin to think neither women are natur secret and they like to do their own secret whi should she hand it over to anyon els she could trust her own guardianship but she could not tell what indirect or polit influenc might be brought to bear upon a busi man besid rememb that she had resolv to use it within a few day it

but was elbow away by anoth loafer who had rush up with the same intent a fierc quarrel broke out which was increas by the two guardsmen who took side with one of the lounger and by the scissor grinder who was equal hot upon the other side a blow was struck and in an instant the ladi who had step from her carriag was the centr of a littl knot of flush and struggl men who struck savag at each other with their fist and stick holm dash into the crowd to protect the ladi but just as he reach her he gave a cri and drop to the ground with the blood run freeli down his face at his fall the guardsmen took to their heel in one direct and the lounger in the other while a number of better dress peopl who had watch the scuffl without take part in it crowd in to help the ladi and to attend to the injur man iren adler as i will still call her had hurri up the step but she stood at the top with her superb figur outlin against the light of the hall look back into the street is the poor

larg affair and of late year it has not done more than just give me a live i use to be abl to keep two assist but now i onli keep one and i would have a job to pay him but that he is will to come for half wage so as to learn the busi what is the name of this oblig youth ask sherlock holm his name is vincent spauld and hes not such a youth either it hard to say his age i should not wish a smarter assist mr holm and i know veri well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am abl to give him but after all if he is satisfi whi should i put idea in his head whi inde you seem most fortun in have an employ who come under the full market price it is not a common experi among employ in this age i dont know that your assist is not as remark as your advertis oh he has his fault too said mr wilson never was such a fellow for photographi snap away with a camera when he ought to be improv his mind and then dive down into the cellar like a rabbit into it hole to develop his pictur that is his main fault but on the whole hes a good worker there no vice in him he is still with you i presum yes sir he and a girl of fourteen who doe a bit of simpl cook and keep the place cleanthat all i have in the hous for i am a widow and never had ani famili we live veri quiet sir the three of us and we keep a roof over our head and pay our debt if we do noth more the first thing that put us out was that advertis spauld he came down into the offic just this day eight week with this veri paper in his hand and he say i wish to the lord mr wilson that i was a red head man whi that i ask whi say he here anoth vacanc on the leagu of the red head men it worth quit a littl fortun to ani man who get it and i understand that there are more vacanc than there are men so that the truste are at their wit end what to do with the money if my hair would onli chang colour here a nice littl crib all readi for me to step into whi what is it then i ask you see mr holm i am a veri stay at home man and as my busi came to me instead of my have to go to it i was often week on end without put my foot over the door mat in that way i didnt know much of what was go on outsid and i was alway glad of a bit of news have you never heard of the leagu of the red head men he ask with his eye open never whi i wonder at that for you are elig yourself for one of the vacanc and what are they worth i ask oh mere a coupl of hundr a year but the work is slight and it need not interfer veri much with one other occup well you can easili think that that made me prick up my ear for the busi has not been over good for some year and an extra coupl of hundr would have been veri handi tell me all about it said i well said he show me the advertis you can see for yourself that the leagu has a vacanc and there is the address where you should appli for particular as far as i can make out the leagu was found by an american millionair ezekiah hopkin who was veri peculiar in his way he was himself red head and he had a great sympathi for all red head men so when he die it was found that he had left his enorm fortun in the hand of truste with instruct to appli the interest to the provid of easi berth to men whose hair is of that colour from all i hear it is splendid pay and veri littl to do but said i there would be million of red head men who would appli not so mani as you might think he answer you see it is realli confin to london and to grown men this american had start from london when he was young and he want to do the old town a good turn then again i have heard it is no use your appli if your hair is light red or dark red or anyth but real bright blaze fieri red now if you care to appli mr wilson you would just walk in but perhap it would hard be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundr pound now it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselv that my hair is of a veri full and rich tint so that it seem to me that if there was to be ani competit in the matter i stood as good a chanc as ani man that i had ever met vincent spauld seem to know so much about it that i thought he might prove use so i just order him to put up the shutter for the day and to come right away with me he was veri will to have a holiday so we shut the busi up and start off for the address that was given us in the advertis i never hope to see such a sight as that again mr holm from north south east and west everi man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramp into the citi to answer the advertis fleet street was choke with red head folk and pope court look like a coster orang barrow i should not have thought there were so mani in the whole countri as were brought togeth by that singl advertis everi shade of colour they werestraw lemon orang brick irish setter liver clay but as spauld said there were not mani who had the real vivid flame colour tint when i saw how mani were wait i would have given it up in despair but spauld would not hear of it how he did it i could not imagin but he push and pull and but until he got me through the crowd and right up to the step which led to the offic there was a doubl stream upon the stair some go up in hope and some come back deject but we wedg in as well as we could and soon found ourselv in the offic your experi has been a most entertain one remark holm as his client paus and refresh his memori with a huge pinch of snuff pray continu your veri interest statement there was noth in the offic but a coupl of wooden chair and a deal tabl behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine he said a few word to each candid as he came up and then he alway manag to find some fault in them which would disqualifi them get a vacanc did not seem to be such a veri easi matter after all howev when our turn came the littl man was much more favour to me than to ani of the other and he close the door as we enter so that he might have a privat word with us this is mr jabez wilson said my assist and he is will to fill a vacanc in the leagu and he is admir suit for it the other answer he has everi requir i cannot recal when i have seen anyth so fine he took a step backward cock his head on one side and gaze at my hair until i felt quit bash then sudden he plung forward wrung my hand and congratul me warm on my success it would be injustic to hesit said he you will howev i am sure excus me for take an obvious precaut with that he seiz my hair in both his hand and tug until i yell with the pain there is water in your eye said he as he releas me i perceiv that all is as it should be but we have to be care for we have twice been deceiv by wig and onc by paint i could tell you tale of cobbler wax which would disgust you with human natur he step over to the window and shout through it at the top of his voic that the vacanc was fill a groan of disappoint came up from below and the folk all troop away in differ direct until there was not a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manag my name said he is mr duncan ross and i am myself one of the pension upon the fund left by our nobl benefactor are you a marri man mr wilson have you a famili i answer that i had not his face fell immedi dear me he said grave that is veri serious inde i am sorri to hear you say that the fund was of cours for the propag and spread of the red head as well as for their mainten it is exceed unfortun that you should be a bachelor my face lengthen at this mr holm for i thought that i was not to have the vacanc after all but after think it over for a few minut he said that it would be all right in the case of anoth said he the object might be fatal but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as your when shall you be abl to enter upon your new duti well it is a littl awkward for i have a busi alreadi said i oh never mind about that mr wilson said vincent spauld i should be abl to look after that for you what would be the hour i ask ten to

with my assist hard know what to say or do i was so pleas at my own good fortun well i thought over the matter all day and by even i was in low spirit again for i had quit persuad myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud though what it object might be i could not imagin it seem altogeth past belief that anyon could make such a will or that they would pay such a sum for do anyth so simpl as copi out the encyclopaedia britannica vincent spauld did what he could to cheer me up but by bedtim i had reason myself out of the whole thing howev in the morn i determin to have a look at it anyhow so i bought a penni bottl of ink and with a quill pen and seven sheet of foolscap paper i start off for pope court well to my surpris and delight everyth was as right as possibl the tabl was set out readi for me and mr duncan ross was there to see that i got fair to work he start me off upon the letter a and then he left me but he would drop in from time to time to see that all

the main arteri which convey the traffic of the citi to the north and west the roadway was block with the immens stream of commerc flow in a doubl tide inward and outward while the footpath were black with the hurri swarm of pedestrian it was difficult to realis as we look at the line of fine shop and state busi premis that they realli abut on the other side upon the fade and stagnant squar which

perfect happi gentl wave his long thin finger in time to the music while his gentl smile face and his languid dreami eye were as unlik those of holm the sleuth hound holm the relentless keen wit readi hand crimin agent as it was possibl to conceiv in his singular charact the dual natur altern assert itself and his extrem exact and astut repres as i have often thought the reaction against the poetic and contempl mood which occasion predomin in him the swing of his natur took him from extrem languor to devour energi and as i knew well he was never so truli formid as when for day on end he had been loung in his armchair amid his improvis and his black letter edit then it was that the lust of the chase would sudden come upon him and that his brilliant reason power would rise to the level of intuit until those who were unacquaint with his method would look askanc at him as on a man whose knowledg was not that of other mortal when i saw him that afternoon so enwrap in the music at st jamess hall i felt that an evil time might be come upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down you want to go home no doubt doctor he remark as we emerg yes it would be as well and i have some

well justifi observ holm and now it is time that we arrang our littl plan i expect that within an hour matter will come to a head in the meantim mr merryweath we must put the screen over that dark lantern and sit in the dark i am afraid so i had brought a pack of card in my pocket and i thought that as we were a parti carre you might have your rubber after all but i see that the enemi prepar have gone so far that we cannot risk the presenc of a light and first of all we must choos our posit these are dare men and though we shall take them at a disadvantag they may do us some harm unless we are care i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselv behind those then when i flash a light upon them close in swift if they fire watson have no compunct about shoot them down i place my revolv cock upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouch holm shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darknesssuch an absolut dark as i have never befor experienc the smell of hot metal remain to assur us that the light was still there readi to flash out at a moment notic to me with my nerv work up to a pitch of expect there was someth depress and

quarter yet it appear to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be break abov us my limb were weari and stiff for i fear to chang my posit yet my nerv were work up to the highest pitch of tension and my hear was so acut that i could not onli hear the gentl breath of my companion but i could distinguish the deeper heavier in breath of the bulki jone from the thin sigh note of the bank director from my posit i could look over the case in the direct of the floor sudden my eye caught the glint of a light at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement then it lengthen out until it becam a yellow line and then without ani warn or sound a gash seem to open and a hand appear a white almost woman hand which felt about in the centr of the littl area of light for a minut or more the hand with it writh finger protrud out of the floor then it was withdrawn as sudden as it appear and all was dark again save the singl lurid spark which mark a chink between the stone it disappear howev was but momentari with a rend tear sound one of the broad white stone turn over upon it side and left a squar gape hole through which stream the light of a lantern over the edg there peep a clean cut boyish face which look keen about it and then with a hand on either side of the apertur drew itself shoulder high and waist high until one knee rest upon the edg in anoth instant he stood at the side of the hole and was haul after him a companion lith and small like himself with a pale face and a shock of veri red hair it all clear he whisper have you the chisel and the bag great scott jump archi jump and ill swing for it sherlock holm had sprung out and seiz the intrud by the collar the other dive down the hole and i heard the sound of rend cloth as jone clutch at his skirt the light flash upon the barrel of a revolv but holm hunt crop came down on the man wrist and the pistol clink upon the stone floor it no use john clay said holm bland you have no chanc at all so i see the other answer with the utmost cool i fanci that my pal is all right though i see you have got his coat tail there are three men wait for him at the door said holm oh inde you seem to have done the thing veri complet i must compliment you and i you holm answer your red head idea was veri new and effect youll see your pal again present said jone hes quicker at climb down hole than i am just hold out while i fix the derbi i beg that you will not touch me with your filthi hand remark our prison as the handcuff clatter upon his wrist you may not be awar that i have royal blood in my vein have the good also when you address me alway to say sir and pleas all right said jone with a stare and a snigger well would you pleas sir march upstair where we can get a cab to carri your high to the polic station that is better said john clay seren he made a sweep bow to the three of us and walk quiet off in the custodi of the detect realli mr holm said mr merryweath as we follow them from the cellar i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you there is no doubt that you have detect and defeat in the most complet manner one of the most determin attempt at bank robberi that have ever come within my experi i have had one or two littl score of my own to settl with mr john clay said holm i have been at some small expens over this matter which i shall expect the bank to refund but beyond that i am ampli repaid by have had an experi which is in mani way uniqu and by hear the veri remark narrat of the red head leagu you see watson he explain in the earli hour of the morn as we sat over a glass of whiski and soda in baker street it was perfect obvious from the first that the onli possibl object of this rather fantast busi of the advertis of the leagu and the copi of the encyclopaedia must be to get this not over bright pawnbrok out of the way for a number of hour everi day it was a curious way of manag it but realli it would be difficult to suggest a better the method was no doubt suggest to clay ingeni mind by the colour of his accomplic hair the 4 pound a week was a lure which must draw him and what was it to them who were play for thousand they put in the advertis one rogu has the temporari offic the other rogu incit the man to appli for it and togeth they manag to secur his absenc everi morn in the week from the time that i heard of the assist have come for half wage it was obvious to me that he had some strong motiv for secur the situat but how could you guess what the motiv was had there been women in the hous i should have suspect a mere vulgar intrigu that howev was out of the question the man busi was a small one and there was noth in his hous which could account for such elabor prepar and such an expenditur as they were at it must then be someth out of the hous what could it be i thought of the assist fond for photographi and his trick of vanish into the cellar the cellar there was the end of this tangl clue then i made inquiri as to this mysteri assist and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most dare crimin in london he was do someth in the cellarsometh which took mani hour a day for month on end what could it be onc more i could think of noth save that he was run a tunnel to some other build so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action i surpris you by beat upon the pavement with my stick i was ascertain whether the cellar stretch out in front or behind it was not in front then i rang the bell and as i hope the assist answer it we have had some skirmish but we had never set eye upon each other befor i hard look at his face his knee were what i wish to see you must yourself have remark how worn wrinkl and stain they were they spoke of those hour of burrow the onli remain point was what they were burrow for i walk round the corner saw the citi and suburban bank abut on our friend premis and felt that i had solv my problem when you drove home after the concert i call upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank director with the result that you have seen and how could you tell that they would make their attempt to night i ask well when they close their leagu offic that was a sign that they care no longer about mr jabez wilson presencein other word that they had complet their tunnel but it was essenti that they should use it soon as it might be discov or the bullion might be remov saturday would suit them better than ani other day as it would give them two day for their escap for all these reason i expect them to come to night you reason it out beauti i exclaim in unfeign admir it is so long a chain and yet everi link ring true it save me from ennui he answer yawn ala i alreadi feel it close in upon me my life is spent in one long effort to escap from the commonplac of exist these littl problem help me to do so and you are a benefactor of the race said i he shrug his shoulder well perhap after all it is of some littl use he remark lhomm cest rienloeuvr cest tout as gustav flaubert wrote to georg sand adventur iii a case of ident my dear fellow said sherlock holm as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodg at baker street life is infinit stranger than anyth which the mind of man could invent we would not dare to conceiv the thing which are realli mere commonplac of exist if we could fli out of that window hand in hand hover over this great citi gentl remov the roof and peep in at the queer thing which are go on the strang coincid the plan the cross purpos the wonder chain of event work through generat and lead to the most outr result it would make all fiction with it convent and foreseen conclus most stale and unprofit and yet i am not convinc of it i answer the case which come to light in the paper are as a rule bald enough and vulgar enough we have in our polic report realism push to it extrem limit and yet the result is it must be confess neither fascin nor artist a certain select and discret must be use in produc a realist effect remark holm this is want in the polic report where more stress is laid perhap upon the platitud of the magistr than upon the detail which to an observ contain the vital essenc of the whole matter depend upon it there is noth so unnatur as the commonplac i smile and shook my head i can quit understand your think so i said of cours in your posit of unoffici advis and helper to everybodi who is absolut puzzl throughout three contin you are brought in contact with all that is strang and bizarr but herei pick up the morn paper from the groundlet us put it to a practic test here is the first head upon which i come a husband cruelti to his wife there is half a column of print but i know without read it that it is all perfect familiar to me there is of cours the other woman the drink the push the blow the bruis the sympathet sister or landladi the crudest of writer could invent noth more crude inde your exampl is an unfortun one for your argument said holm take the paper and glanc his eye down it this is the dunda separ case and as it happen i was engag in clear up some small point in connect with it the husband was a teetotal there was no other woman and the conduct complain of was that he had drift into the habit of wind up everi meal by take out his fals teeth and hurl them at his wife which you will allow is not an action like to occur to the imagin of the averag stori teller take a pinch of snuff doctor and acknowledg that i have score over you in your exampl he held out his snuffbox of old gold with a great amethyst in the centr of the lid it splendour was in such contrast to his home way and simpl life that i could not help comment upon it ah said he i forgot that i had not seen you for some week it is a littl souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assist in the case of the iren adler paper and the ring i ask glanc at a remark brilliant which sparkl upon his finger it was from the reign famili of holland though the matter in which i serv them was of such delicaci that i cannot confid it even to you who have been good enough to chronicl one or two of my littl problem and have you ani on hand just now i ask with interest some ten or twelv but none which present ani featur of interest they are import you understand without be interest inde i have found that it is usual in unimport matter that there is a field for the observ and for the quick analysi of caus and effect which give the charm to an investig the larger crime are apt to be the simpler for the bigger the crime the more obvious as a rule is the motiv in these case save for one rather intric matter which has been refer to me from marseill there is noth which present ani featur of interest it is possibl howev that i may have someth better befor veri mani minut are over for this is one of my client or i am much mistaken he had risen from his chair and was stand between the part blind gaze down into the dull neutral tint london street look over his shoulder i saw that on the pavement opposit there stood a larg woman with a heavi fur boa round her neck and a larg curl red feather in a broad brim hat which was tilt in a coquettish duchess of devonshir fashion over her ear from under this great panopli she peep up in a nervous hesit fashion at our window while her bodi oscil backward and forward and her finger fidget with her glove button sudden with a plung as of the swimmer who leav the bank she hurri across the road and we heard the sharp clang of the bell i have seen those symptom befor said holm throw his cigarett into the fire oscil upon the pavement alway mean an affair de coeur she would like advic but is not sure that the matter is not too delic for communic and yet even here we may discrimin when a woman has been serious wrong by a man she no longer oscil and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire here we may take it that there is a love matter but that the maiden is not so much angri as perplex or griev but here she come in person to resolv our doubt as he spoke there was a tap at the door and the boy in button enter to announc miss mari sutherland while the ladi herself loom behind his small black figur like a full sail merchant man behind a tini pilot boat sherlock holm welcom her with the easi courtesi for which he was remark and have close the door and bow her into an armchair he look her over in the minut and yet abstract fashion which was peculiar to him do you not find he said that with your short sight it is a littl tri to do so much typewrit i did at first she answer but now i know where the letter are without look then sudden realis the full purport of his word she gave a violent start and look up with fear and astonish upon her broad good humour face youv heard about me mr holm she cri els how could you know all that never mind said holm laugh it is my busi to know thing perhap i have train myself to see what other overlook if not whi should you come to consult me i came to you sir becaus i heard of you from mrs ethereg whose husband you found so easi when the polic and everyon had given him up for dead oh mr holm i wish you would do as much for me im not rich but still i have a hundr a year in my own right besid the littl that i make by the machin and i would give it all to know what has becom of mr hosmer angel whi did you come away to consult me in such a hurri ask sherlock holm with his finger tip togeth and his eye to the ceil again a startl look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mari sutherland yes i did bang out of the hous she said for it made me angri to see the easi way in which mr windibankthat is my fathertook it all he would not go to the polic and he would not go to you and so at last as he would do noth and kept on say that there was no harm done it made me mad and i just on with my thing and came right away to you your father said holm your stepfath sure sinc the name is differ yes my stepfath i call him father though it sound funni too for he is onli five year and two month older than myself and your mother is aliv oh yes mother is aliv and well i wasnt best pleas mr holm when she marri again so soon after father death and a man who was near fifteen year younger than herself father was a plumber in the tottenham court road and he left a tidi busi behind him which mother carri on with mr hardi the foreman but when mr windibank came he made her sell the busi for he was veri superior be a travel in wine they got 4700 pound for the goodwil and interest which wasnt near as much as father could have got if he had been aliv i had expect to see sherlock holm impati under this rambl and inconsequenti narrat but on the contrari he had listen with the greatest concentr of attent your own littl incom he ask doe it come out of the busi oh no sir it is quit separ and was left me by my uncl ned in auckland it is in new zealand stock pay 4 1/2 per cent two thousand five hundr pound was the amount but i can onli touch the interest you interest me extrem said holm and sinc you draw so larg a sum as a hundr a year with what you earn into the bargain you no doubt travel a littl and indulg yourself in everi way i believ that a singl ladi can get on veri nice upon an incom of about 60 pound i could do with much less than that mr holm but you understand that as long as i live at home i dont wish to be a burden to them and so they have the use of the money just while i am stay with them of cours that is onli just for the time mr windibank draw my interest everi quarter and pay it over to mother and i find that i can do pretti well with what i earn at typewrit it bring me twopenc a sheet and i can often do from fifteen to twenti sheet in a day you have made your posit veri clear to me said holm this is my friend dr watson befor whom you can speak as freeli as befor myself kind tell us now all about your connect with mr hosmer angel a flush stole over miss sutherland face and she pick nervous at the fring of her jacket i met him first at the gasfitt ball she said they use to send father ticket when he was aliv and then afterward they rememb us and sent them to mother mr windibank did not wish us to go he never did wish us to go anywher he would get quit mad if i want so much as to join a sunday school treat but this time i was set on go and i would go for what right had he to prevent he said the folk were not fit for us to know when all father friend were to be there and he said that i had noth fit to wear when i had my purpl plush that i had never so much as taken out of the drawer at last when noth els would do he went off to franc upon the busi of the firm but we went mother and i with mr hardi who use to be our foreman and it was there i met mr hosmer angel i suppos said holm that when mr windibank came back from franc he was veri annoy at your have gone to the ball oh well he was veri good about it he laugh i rememb and shrug his shoulder and said there was no use deni anyth to a woman for she would have her way i see then at the gasfitt ball you met as i understand a gentleman call mr hosmer angel yes sir i met him that night and he call next day to ask if we had got home all safe and after that we met himthat is to say mr holm i met him twice for walk but after that father came back again and mr hosmer angel could not come to the hous ani more no well you know father didnt like anyth of the sort he wouldnt have ani visitor if he could help it and he use to say that a woman should be happi in her own famili circl but then as i use to say to mother a woman want her own circl to begin with and i had not got mine yet but how about mr hosmer angel did he make no attempt to see you well father was go off to franc again in a week and hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone we could write in the meantim and he use to write everi day i took the letter in in the morn so there was no need for father to know were you engag to the gentleman at this time oh yes mr holm we were engag after the first walk that we took hosmermr angelwa a cashier in an offic in leadenhal streetand what offic that the worst of it mr holm i dont know where did he live then he slept on the premis and you dont know his address noexcept that it was leadenhal street where did you address your letter then to the leadenhal street post offic to be left till call for he said that if they were sent to the offic he would be chaf by all the other clerk about have letter from a ladi so i offer to typewrit them like he did his but he wouldnt have that for he said that when i wrote them they seem to come from me but when they were typewritten he alway felt that the machin had come between us that will just show you how fond he was of me mr holm and the littl thing that he would think of it was most suggest said holm it has long been an axiom of mine that the littl thing are infinit the most import can you rememb ani other littl thing about mr hosmer angel he was a veri shi man mr holm he would rather walk with me in the even than in the daylight for he said that he hate to be conspicu veri retir and gentleman he was even his voic was gentl hed had the quinsi and swollen gland when he was young he told me and it had left him with a weak throat and a hesit whisper fashion of speech he was alway well dress veri neat and plain but his eye were weak just as mine are and he wore tint glass against the glare well and what happen when mr windibank your stepfath return to franc mr hosmer angel came to the hous again and propos that we should marri befor father came back he was in dread earnest and made me swear with my hand on the testament that whatev happen i would alway be true to him mother said he was quit right to make me swear and that it was a sign of his passion mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than i was then when they talk of marri within the week i began to ask about father but they both said never to mind about father but just to tell him afterward and mother said she would make it all right with him i didnt quit like that mr holm it seem funni that i should ask his leav as he was onli a few year older than me but i didnt want to do anyth on the sli so i wrote to father at bordeaux where the compani has it french offic but the letter came back to me on the veri morn of the wed it miss him then yes sir for he had start to england just befor it arriv ha that was unfortun your wed was arrang then for the friday was it to be in church yes sir but veri quiet it was to be at st saviour near king cross and we were to have breakfast afterward at the st pancra hotel hosmer came for us in a hansom but as there were two of us he put us both into it and step himself into a four wheeler which happen to be the onli other cab in the street we got to the church first and when the four wheeler drove up we wait for him to step out but he never did and when the cabman got down from the box and look there was no one there the cabman said that he could not imagin what had becom of him for he had seen him get in with his own eye that was last friday mr holm and i have never seen or heard anyth sinc then to throw ani light upon what becam of him it seem to me that you have been veri shame treat said holm oh no sir he was too good and kind to leav me so whi all the morn he was say to me that whatev happen i was to be true and that even if someth quit unforeseen occur to separ us i was alway to rememb that i was pledg to him and that he would claim his pledg sooner or later it seem strang talk for a wed morn but what has happen sinc give a mean to it most certain it doe your own opinion is then that some unforeseen catastroph has occur to him yes sir i believ that he foresaw some danger or els he would not have talk so and then i think that what he foresaw happen but you have no notion as to what it could have been none one more question how did your mother take the matter she was angri and said that i was never to speak of the matter again and your father did you tell him yes and he seem to think with me that someth had happen and that i should hear of hosmer again as he said what interest could anyon have in bring me to the door of the church and then leav me now if he had borrow my money or if he had marri me and got my money settl on him there might be some reason but hosmer was veri independ about money and never would look at a shill of mine and yet what could have happen and whi could he

still press togeth his leg stretch out in front of him and his gaze direct upward to the ceil then he took down from the rack the old and oili clay pipe which was to him as a counsellor and have lit it he lean back in his chair with the thick blue cloud wreath spin up from him and a look of infinit languor in his face quit an interest studi that maiden he observ i found her more interest than her littl problem which by the way is rather a trite one you will find parallel case if you consult my index in andov in 77 and there was someth of the sort at the hagu last year old as is the idea howev there were one or two detail which were new to me but the maiden herself was most instruct you appear to read a good deal upon her which was quit invis to me i remark not invis but unnot watson you did not know where to look and so you miss all that was import i can never bring you to realis the import of sleev the suggest of thumb nail or the great issu that may hang from a boot lace now what did you gather from that woman appear describ it well she had a slate colour broad brim straw hat with a feather of a brickish red her jacket was black with black bead sewn upon it and a fring of littl black jet ornament her dress was brown rather darker than coffe colour with a littl purpl plush at the neck and sleev her glove were greyish and were worn through at the right forefing her boot

impress my boy but concentr yourself upon detail my first glanc is alway at a woman sleev in a man it is perhap better first to take the knee of the trouser as you observ this woman had plush upon her sleev which is a most use materi for show trace the doubl line a littl abov the wrist where the typewritist press against the tabl was beauti defin the sew machin of the hand type leav a similar mark but onli on the left arm and on the side of it farthest from the thumb instead of be right across the broadest part as this was i then glanc at her face and observ the dint of a pinc nez at either side of her nose i ventur a remark upon short sight and typewrit which seem to surpris her it surpris me but sure it was obvious i was then much surpris and interest on glanc down to observ that though the boot which she was wear were not unlik each other they were realli odd one the one have a slight decor toe cap and the other a plain one one was button onli in the two lower button out of five and the other at the first third and fifth now when you see that a young ladi otherwis neat dress has come away from home with odd boot half button it is no great deduct to say that she came away in a hurri and what els i ask keen interest as i alway was by my friend incis reason i note in pass that she had written a note befor leav home but after be fulli dress you observ that her right glove was torn at the forefing but you did not appar see that both glove and finger were stain with violet ink she had written in a hurri and dip her pen too deep it must have been this morn or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger all this is amus though rather elementari but i must go back to busi watson would you mind read me the advertis descript of mr hosmer angel i held the littl

absolut no clue in them to mr angel save that he quot balzac onc there is one remark point howev which will no doubt strike you they are typewritten i remark not onli that but the signatur is typewritten look at the neat littl hosmer angel at the bottom there is a date you see but no superscript except leadenhal street which is rather vagu the point about the signatur is veri suggestivein fact we may call it conclus of what my dear fellow is it possibl you do not see how strong it bear upon the case i cannot say that i do unless it were that he wish to be abl to deni his signatur if an action for breach of promis were institut no that was not the point howev i shall write two letter which should settl the matter one is to a firm in the citi the other is to the young ladi stepfath mr windibank ask him whether he could meet us here at six oclock tomorrow even it is just as well that we should do busi with the male relat and now doctor we can do noth until the answer to those letter come so we may put our littl problem upon the shelf for the interim i had had so mani reason to believ in my friend subtl power of reason and extraordinari energi in action that i felt that he must have some solid ground for the assur and easi demeanour with which he treat the singular mysteri which he had been call upon to fathom onc onli had i known him to fail in the case of the king of bohemia and of the iren adler photograph but when i look back to the weird busi of the sign of four and the extraordinari circumst connect with the studi in scarlet i felt that it would be a strang tangl inde which he could not unravel i left him then still puf at his black clay pipe with the convict that when i came again on the next even i would find that he held in his hand all the clue which would lead up to the ident of the disappear bridegroom of miss mari sutherland a profession case of great graviti was engag my own attent at the time and the whole of next day i was busi at the bedsid of the suffer it was not until close upon six oclock that i found myself free and was abl to spring into a hansom and drive to baker street half afraid that i might be too late to assist at the denouement of the littl mysteri i found sherlock holm alon howev half asleep with his long thin form curl up in the recess of his armchair a formid array of bottl and test tube with the pungent clean smell of hydrochlor acid told me that he had spent his day in the chemic work which was so dear to him well have you solv it i ask as i enter yes it was the bisulph of baryta no no the mysteri i cri oh that i thought of the salt that i have been work upon there was never ani mysteri in the matter though as i said yesterday some of the detail are of interest the onli drawback is that there is no law i fear that can touch the scoundrel who was he then and what was his object in desert miss sutherland the question was hard out of my mouth and holm had not yet open his lip to repli when we heard a heavi footfal in the passag and a tap at the door this is the girl stepfath mr jame windibank said holm he has written to me to say that he would be here at six come in the man who enter was a sturdi middl size fellow some thirti year of age clean shaven and sallow skin with a bland insinu manner and a pair of wonder sharp and penetr grey eye he shot a question glanc at each of us place his shini top hat upon the sideboard and with a slight bow sidl down into the nearest chair good even mr jame windibank said holm i think that this typewritten letter is from you in which you made an appoint with me for six oclock yes sir i am afraid that i am a littl late but i am not quit my own master you know i am sorri that miss sutherland has troubl you about this littl matter for i think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public it was quit against my wish that she came but she is a veri excit impuls girl as you may have notic and she is not easili control when she has made up her mind on a point of cours i did not mind you so much as you are not connect with the offici polic but it is not pleasant to have a famili misfortun like this nois abroad besid it is a useless expens for how could you possibl find this hosmer angel on the contrari said holm quiet i have everi reason to believ that i will succeed in discov mr hosmer angel mr windibank gave a violent start and drop his glove i am delight to hear it he said it is a curious thing remark holm that a typewrit has realli quit as much individu as a man handwrit unless they are quit new no two of them write exact alik some letter get more worn than other and some wear onli on one side now you remark in this note of your mr windibank that in everi case there is some littl slur over of the e and a slight defect in the tail of the r there are fourteen other characterist but those are the more obvious we do all our correspond with this machin at the offic and no doubt it is a littl worn our visitor answer glanc keen at holm with his bright littl eye and now i will show you what is realli a veri interest studi mr windibank holm continu i think of write anoth littl monograph some of these day on the typewrit and it relat to crime it is a subject to which i have devot some littl attent i have here four letter which purport to come from the miss man they are all typewritten in each case not onli are the es slur and the rs tailless but you will observ if you care to use my magnifi len that the fourteen other characterist to which i have allud are there as well mr windibank sprang out of his chair and pick up his hat i cannot wast time over this sort of fantast talk mr holm he said if you can catch the man catch him and let me know when you have done it certain said holm step over and turn the key in the door i let you know then that i have caught him what where shout mr windibank turn white to his lip and glanc about him like a rat in a trap oh it wont doreal it wont said holm suav there is no possibl get out of it mr windibank it is quit too transpar and it was a veri bad compliment when you said that it was imposs for me to solv so simpl a question that right sit down and let us talk it over our visitor collaps into a chair with a ghast face and a glitter of moistur on his brow itit not action he stammer i am veri much afraid that it is not but between ourselv windibank it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petti way as ever came befor me now let me just run over the cours of event and you will contradict me if i go wrong the man sat huddl up in his chair with his head sunk upon his breast like one who is utter crush holm stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiec and lean back with his hand in his pocket began talk rather to himself as it seem than to us the man marri a woman veri much older than himself for her money said he and he enjoy the use of the money of the daughter as long as she live with them it was a consider sum for peopl in their posit and the loss of it would have made a serious differ it was worth an effort to preserv it the daughter was of a good amiabl disposit but affection and warm heart in her way so that it was evid that with her fair person advantag and her littl incom she would not be allow to remain singl long now her marriag would mean of cours the loss of a hundr a year so what doe her stepfath do to prevent it he take the obvious cours of keep her at home and forbid her to seek the compani of peopl of her own age but soon he found that that would not answer forev she becam restiv insist upon her right and final announc her posit intent of go to a certain ball what doe her clever stepfath do then he conceiv an idea more credit to his head than to his heart with the conniv and assist of his wife he disguis himself cover those keen eye with tint glass mask the face with a moustach and a pair of bushi whisker sunk that clear voic into an insinu whisper and doubli secur on account of the girl short sight he appear as mr hosmer angel and keep off other lover by make love himself it was onli a joke at first groan our visitor we never thought that she would have been so carri away veri like not howev that may be the young ladi was veri decid carri away and have quit made up her mind that her stepfath was in franc the suspicion of treacheri never for an instant enter her mind she was flatter by the gentleman attent and the effect was increas by the loud express admir of her mother then mr angel began to call for it was obvious that the matter should be push as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produc there were meet and an engag which would final secur the girl affect from turn toward anyon els but the decept could not be kept up forev these pretend journey to franc were rather cumbrous the thing to do was clear to bring the busi to an end in such a dramat manner that it would leav a perman impress upon the young ladi mind and prevent her from look upon ani other suitor for some time to come henc those vow of fidel exact upon a testament and henc also the allus to a possibl of someth happen on the veri morn of the wed jame windibank wish miss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel and so uncertain as to his fate that for ten year to come at ani rate she would not listen to anoth man as far as the church door he brought her and then as he could go no farther he conveni vanish away by the old trick of step in at one door of a four wheeler and out at the other i think that was the chain of event mr windibank our visitor had recov someth of his assur while holm had been talk and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face it may be so or it may not mr holm said he but if you are so veri sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are break the law now and not me i have done noth action from the first but as long as you keep that door lock you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illeg constraint the law cannot as you say touch you said holm unlock and throw open the door yet there never was a man who deserv punish more if the young ladi has a brother or a friend he ought to lay a whip across your shoulder by jove he continu flush up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man face it is not part of my duti to my client but here a hunt crop handi and i think i shall just treat myself to he took two swift step to the whip but befor he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of step upon the stair the heavi hall door bang and from the window we could see mr jame windibank run at the top of his speed down the road there a cold blood scoundrel said holm laugh as he threw himself down into his chair onc more that fellow will rise from crime to crime until he doe someth veri bad and end on a gallow the case has in some respect been not entir devoid of interest i cannot now entir see all the step of your reason i remark well of cours it was obvious from the first that this mr hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct and it was equal clear that the onli man who realli profit by the incid as far as we could see was the stepfath then the fact that the two men were never togeth but that the one alway appear when the other was away was suggest so were the tint spectacl and the curious voic which both hint at a disguis as did the bushi whisker my suspicion were all confirm by his peculiar action in typewrit his signatur which of cours infer that his handwrit was so familiar to her that she would recognis even the smallest sampl of it you see all these isol fact togeth with mani minor one all point in the same direct and how did you verifi them have onc spot my man it was easi to get corrobor i knew the firm for which this man work have taken the print descript i elimin everyth from it which could be the result of a disguiseth whisker the glass the voic and i sent it to the firm with a request that they would inform me whether it answer to the descript of ani of their travel i had alreadi notic the peculiar of the typewrit and i wrote to the man himself at his busi address ask him if he would come here as i expect his repli was typewritten and reveal the same trivial but characterist defect the same post brought me a letter from westhous and marbank of fenchurch street to say that the descript talli in everi respect with that of their employ jame windibank voila tout and miss sutherland if i tell her she will not believ me you may rememb the old persian say there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub and danger also for whoso snatch a delus from a woman there is as much sens in hafiz as in horac and as much knowledg of the world adventur iv the boscomb valley mysteri we were seat at breakfast one morn my wife and i when the maid brought in a telegram it was from sherlock holm and ran in this way have you a coupl of day to spare have just been wire for from the west of england in connect with boscomb valley tragedi shall be glad if you will come with me air and sceneri perfect leav paddington by the 1115 what do you say dear said my wife look across at me will you go i realli dont know what to say i have a fair long list at present oh anstruth would do your work for you you have been look a littl pale late i think that the chang would do you good and you are alway so interest in mr sherlock holm case i should be ungrat if i were not see what i gain through one of them i answer but if i am to go i must pack at onc for i have onli half an hour my experi of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the effect of make me a prompt and readi travel my want were few and simpl so that in less than the time state i was in a cab with my valis rattl away to paddington station sherlock holm was pace up and down the platform his tall gaunt figur made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travel cloak and close fit cloth cap it is realli veri good of you to come watson said he it make a consider differ to me have someon with me on whom i can thorough reli local aid is alway either worthless or els biass if you will keep the two corner seat i shall get the ticket we had the carriag to ourselv save for an immens litter of paper which holm had brought with him among these he rummag and read with interv of note take and of medit until we were past read then he sudden roll them all into a gigant ball and toss them up onto the rack have you heard anyth of the case he ask not a word i have not seen a paper for some day the london press has not had veri full account i have just been look through all the recent paper in order to master the particular it seem from what i gather to be one of those simpl case which are so extrem difficult that sound a littl paradox but it is profound true singular is almost invari a clue the more featureless and commonplac a crime is the more difficult it is to bring it home in this case howev they have establish a veri serious case against the son of the murder man it is a murder then well it is conjectur to be so i shall take noth for grant until i have the opportun of look person into it i will explain the state of thing to you as far as i have been abl to understand it in a veri few word boscomb valley is a countri district not veri far from ross in herefordshir the largest land proprietor in that part is a mr john turner who made his money in australia and return some year ago to the old countri one of the farm which he held that of hatherley was let to mr charl mccarthi who was also an ex australian the men had known each other in the coloni so that it was not unnatur that when they came to settl down they should do so as near each other as possibl turner was appar the richer man so mccarthi becam his tenant but still remain it seem upon term of perfect equal as they were frequent togeth mccarthi had one son a lad of eighteen and turner had an onli daughter of the same age but neither of them had wive live they appear to have avoid the societi of the neighbour english famili and to have led retir live though both the mccarthi were fond of sport and were frequent seen at the race meet of the neighbourhood mccarthi kept two servantsa man and a girl turner had a consider household some half dozen at the least that is as much as i have been abl to gather about the famili now for the fact on june 3rd that is on monday last mccarthi left his hous at hatherley about three in the afternoon and walk down to the boscomb pool which is a small lake form by the spread out of the stream which run down the boscomb valley he had been out with his serv man in the morn at ross and he had told the man that he must hurri as he had an appoint of import to keep at three from that appoint he never came back aliv from hatherley farm hous to the boscomb pool is a quarter of a mile and two peopl saw him as he pass over this ground one was an old woman whose name is not mention and the other was william crowder a game keeper in the employ of mr turner both these wit depos that mr mccarthi was walk alon the game keeper add that within a few minut of his see mr mccarthi pass he had seen his son mr jame mccarthi go the same way with a gun under his arm to the best of his belief the father was actual in sight at the time and the son was follow him he thought no more of the matter until he heard in the even of the tragedi that had occur the two mccarthi were seen after the time when william crowder the game keeper lost sight of them the boscomb pool is thick wood round with just a fring of grass and of reed round the edg a girl of fourteen patienc moran who is the daughter of the lodg keeper of the boscomb valley estat was in one of the wood pick flower she state that while she was there she saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake mr mccarthi and his son and that they appear to be have a violent quarrel she heard mr mccarthi the elder use veri strong languag to his son and she saw the latter rais up his hand as if to strike his father she was so frighten by their violenc that she ran away and told her mother when she reach home that she had left the two mccarthi quarrel near boscomb pool and that she was afraid that they were go to fight she had hard said the word when young mr mccarthi came run up to the lodg to say that he had found his father dead in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodg keeper he was much excit without either his gun or his hat and his right hand and sleev were observ to be stain with fresh blood on follow him they found the dead bodi stretch out upon the grass besid the pool the head had been beaten in by repeat blow of some heavi and blunt weapon the injuri were such as might veri well have been inflict by the butt end of his son gun which was found lie on the grass within a few pace of the bodi under these circumst the young man was instant arrest and a verdict of wil murder have been return at the inquest on tuesday he was on wednesday brought befor the magistr at ross who have refer the case to the next assiz those are the main fact of the case as they came out befor the coron and the polic court i could hard imagin a more damn case i remark if ever circumstanti evid point to a crimin it doe so here circumstanti evid is a veri tricki thing answer holm thought it may seem to point veri straight to one thing but if you shift your own point of view a littl you may find it point in an equal uncompromis manner to someth entir differ it must be confess howev that the case look exceed grave against the young man and it is veri possibl that he is inde the culprit there are sever peopl in the neighbourhood howev and among them miss turner the daughter of the neighbour landown who believ in his innoc and who have retain lestrad whom you may recollect in connect with the studi in scarlet to work out the case in his interest lestrad be rather puzzl has refer the case to me and henc it is that two middl age gentlemen are fli westward at fifti mile an hour instead of quiet digest their breakfast at home i am afraid said i that the fact are so obvious that you will find littl credit to be gain out of this case there is noth more decept than an obvious fact he answer laugh besid we may chanc to hit upon some other obvious fact which may have been by no mean obvious to mr lestrad you know me too well to think that i am boast when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theori by mean which he is quit incap of employ or even of understand to take the first exampl to hand i veri clear perceiv that in your bedroom the window is upon the right hand side and yet i question whether mr lestrad would have note even so self evid a thing as that how on earth my dear fellow i know you well i know the militari neat which characteris you you shave everi morn and in this season you shave by the sunlight but sinc your shave is less and less complet as we get farther back on the left side until it becom posit sloven as we get round the angl of the jaw it is sure veri clear that that side is less illumin than the other i could not imagin a man of your habit look at himself in an equal light and be satisfi with such a result i onli quot this as a trivial exampl of observ and infer therein lie my metier and it is just possibl that it may be of some servic in the investig which lie befor us there are one or two minor point which were brought out in the inquest and which are worth consid what are they it appear that his arrest did not take place at onc but after the return to hatherley farm on the inspector of constabulari inform him that he was a prison he remark that he was not surpris to hear it and that it was no more than his desert this observ of his had the natur effect of remov ani trace of doubt which might have remain in the mind of the coron juri it was a confess i ejacul no for it was follow by a protest of innoc come on the top of such a damn seri of event it was at least a most suspici remark on the contrari said holm it is the brightest rift which i can at present see in the cloud howev innoc he might be he could not be such an absolut imbecil as not to see that the circumst were veri black against him had he appear surpris at his own arrest or feign indign at it i should have look upon it as high suspici becaus such surpris or anger would not be natur under the circumst and yet might appear to be the best polici to a scheme man his frank accept of the situat mark him as either an innoc man or els as a man of consider self restraint and firm as to his remark about his desert it was also not unnatur if you consid that he stood besid the dead bodi of his father and that there is no doubt that he had that veri day so far forgotten his filial duti as to bandi word with him and even accord to the littl girl whose evid is so import to rais his hand as if to strike him the self reproach and contrit which are display in his remark appear to me to be the sign of a healthi mind rather than of a guilti one i shook my head mani men have been hang on far slighter evid i remark so they have and mani men have been wrong hang what is the young man own account of the matter it is i am afraid not veri encourag to his support though there are one or two point in it which are suggest you will find it here and may read it for yourself he pick out from his bundl a copi of the local herefordshir paper and have turn down the sheet he point out the paragraph in which the unfortun young man had given his own statement of what had occur i settl myself down in the corner of the carriag and read it veri care it ran in this way mr jame mccarthi the onli son of the deceas was then call and gave evid as follow i had been away from home for three day at bristol and had onli just return upon the morn of last monday the 3rd my father was absent from home at the time of my arriv and i was inform by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john cobb the groom short after my return i heard the wheel of his trap in the yard and look out of my window i saw him get out and walk rapid out of the yard though i was not awar in which direct he was go i then took my gun and stroll out in the direct of the boscomb pool with the intent of visit the rabbit warren which is upon the other side on my way i saw william crowder the game keeper as he had state in his evid but he is mistaken in think that i was follow my father i had no idea that he was in front of me when about a hundr yard from the pool i heard a cri of cooee which was a usual signal between my father and myself i then hurri forward and found him stand by the pool he appear to be much surpris at see me and ask me rather rough what i was do there a convers ensu which led to high word and almost to blow for my father was a man of a veri violent temper see that his passion was becom ungovern i left him and return toward hatherley farm i had not gone more than 150 yard howev when i heard a hideous outcri behind me which caus me to run back again i found my father expir upon the ground with his head terribl injur i drop my gun and held him in my arm but he almost instant expir i knelt besid him for some minut and then made my way to mr turner lodg keeper his hous be the nearest to ask for assist i saw no one near my father when i return and i have no idea how he came by his injuri he was not a popular man be somewhat cold and forbid in his manner but he had as far as i know no activ enemi i know noth further of the matter the coron did your father make ani statement to you befor he die wit he mumbl a few word but i could onli catch some allus to a rat the coron what did you understand by that wit it convey no mean to me i thought that he was deliri the coron what was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel wit i should prefer not to answer the coron i am afraid that i must press it wit it is realli imposs for me to tell you i can assur you that it has noth to do with the sad tragedi which follow the coron that is for the court to decid i need not point out to you that your refus to answer will prejudic your case consider in ani futur proceed which may aris wit i must still refus the coron i understand that the cri of cooee was a common signal between you and your father wit it was the coron how was it then that he utter it befor he saw you and befor he even knew that you had return from bristol wit with consider confus i do not know a juryman did you see noth which arous your suspicion when you return on hear the cri and found your father fatal injur wit noth definit the coron what do you mean wit i was so disturb and excit as i rush out into the open that i could think of noth except of my father yet i have a vagu impress that as i ran forward someth lay upon the ground to the left of me it seem to me to be someth grey in colour a coat of some sort or a plaid perhap when i rose from my father i look round for it but it was gone do you mean that it disappear befor you went for help yes it was gone you cannot say what it was no i had a feel someth was there how far from the bodi a dozen yard or so and how far from the edg of the wood about the same then if it was remov it was while you were within a dozen yard of it yes but with my back toward it this conclud the examin of the wit i see said i as i glanc down the column that the coron in his conclud remark was rather sever upon young mccarthi he call attent and with reason to the discrep about his father have signal to him befor see him also to his refus to give detail of his convers with his father and his singular account of his father die word they are all as he remark veri much against the son holm laugh soft to himself and stretch himself out upon the cushion seat both you and the coron have been at some pain said he to singl out the veri strongest point in the young man favour dont you see that you altern give him credit for have too much imagin and too littl too littl if he could not invent a caus of quarrel which would give him the sympathi of the juri too much if he evolv from his own inner conscious anyth so outr as a die refer to a rat and the incid of the vanish cloth no sir i shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man say is true and

that i see my way to clear jame mccarthi said holm have you an order to see him in prison yes but onli for you and me then i shall reconsid my resolut about go out we have still time to take a train to hereford and see him to night ampl then let us do so watson i fear that you will find it veri slow but i shall onli be away a coupl of hour i walk down to the station with them and then wander through the street of the littl town final return to the hotel where i lay upon the sofa and tri to interest myself in a yellow back novel the puni plot of the stori was so thin howev when compar to the deep mysteri through which we were grope and i found my attent wander so continu from the action to the fact that i at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entir to a consider of the event of the day suppos that this unhappi young man stori were absolut true then what hellish thing what absolut unforeseen and extraordinari calam could have occur between the time when he part from his father and the moment when drawn back by his scream he rush into the glade it was someth terribl and dead what could it be might not the natur of the injuri reveal someth to my medic instinct i rang the bell and call for the week counti paper which contain a verbatim account of the inquest in the surgeon deposit it was state that the posterior third of the left pariet bone and the left half of the occipit bone had been shatter by a heavi blow from a blunt weapon i mark the spot upon my own head clear such a blow must have been struck from behind that was to some extent in favour of the accus as when seen quarrel he was face to face with his father still it did not go for veri much for the older man might have turn his back befor the blow fell still it might be worth while to call holm attent to it then there was the peculiar die refer to a rat what could that mean it could not be delirium a man die from a sudden blow doe not common becom deliri no it was more like to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate but what could it indic i cudgel my brain to find some possibl explan and then the incid of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthi if that were true the murder must have drop some part of his dress presum his overcoat in his flight and must have had the hardihood to return and to carri it away at the instant when the son was kneel with his back turn not a dozen pace off what a tissu of mysteri and improb the whole thing was i did not wonder at lestrad opinion and yet i had so much faith in sherlock holm insight that i could not lose hope as long as everi fresh fact seem to strengthen his convict of young mccarthi innoc it was late befor sherlock holm return he came back alon for lestrad was stay in lodg in the town the glass still keep veri high he remark as he sat down it is of import that it should not rain befor we are abl to go over the ground on the other hand a man should be at his veri best and keenest for such nice work as that and i did not wish to do it when fag by a long journey i have seen young mccarthi and what did you learn from him noth could he throw no light none at all i was inclin to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screen him or her but i am convinc now that he is as puzzl as everyon els he is not a veri quick wit youth though come to look at and i should think sound at heart i cannot admir his tast i remark if it is inde a fact that he was avers to a marriag with so charm a young ladi as this miss turner ah therebi hang a rather pain tale this fellow is mad insan in love with her but some two year ago when he was onli a lad and befor he realli knew her for she had been away five year at a board school what doe the idiot do but get into the clutch of a barmaid in bristol and marri her at a registri offic no one know a word of the matter but you can imagin how madden it must be to him to be upbraid for not do what he would give his veri eye to do but what he know to be absolut imposs it was sheer frenzi of this sort which made him throw his hand up into the air when his father at their last interview was goad him on to propos to miss turner on the other hand he had no mean of support himself and his father who was by all account a veri hard man would have thrown him over utter had he known the truth it was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three day in bristol and his father did not know where he was mark that point it is of import good has come out of evil howev for the barmaid find from the paper that he is in serious troubl and like to be hang has thrown him over utter and has written to him to say that she has a husband alreadi in the bermuda dockyard so that there is realli no tie between them i think that that bit of news has consol young mccarthi for all that he has suffer but if he is innoc who has done it ah who i would call your attent veri particular to two point one is that the murder man had an appoint with someon at the pool and that the someon could not have been his son for his son was away and he did not know when he would return the second is that the murder man was heard to cri cooee befor he knew that his son had return those are the crucial point upon which the case depend and now let us talk about georg meredith if you pleas and we shall leav all minor matter until to morrow there was no rain as holm had foretold and the morn broke bright and cloudless at nine oclock lestrad call for us with the carriag and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscomb pool there is serious news this morn lestrad observ it is said that mr turner of the hall is so ill that his life is despair of an elder man i presum said holm about sixti but his constitut has been shatter by his life abroad and he has been in fail health for some time this busi has had a veri bad effect upon him he was an old friend of mccarthi and i may add a great benefactor to him for i have learn that he gave him hatherley farm rent free inde that is interest said holm oh yes in a hundr other way he has help him everybodi about here speak of his kind to him realli doe it not strike you as a littl singular that this mccarthi who appear to have had littl of his own and to have been under such oblig to turner should still talk of marri his son to turner daughter who is presum heiress to the estat and that in such a veri cocksur manner as if it were mere a case of a propos and all els would follow it is the more strang sinc we know that turner himself was avers to the idea the daughter told us as much do you not deduc someth from that we have got to the deduct and the infer said lestrad wink at me i find it hard enough to tackl fact holm without fli away after theori and fanci you are right said holm demur you do find it veri hard to tackl the fact anyhow i have grasp one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of repli lestrad with some warmth and that is that mccarthi senior met his death from mccarthi junior and that all theori to the contrari are the merest moonshin well moonshin is a brighter thing than fog said holm laugh but i am veri much mistaken if this is not hatherley farm upon the left yes that is it it was a widespread comfort look build two stori slate roof with great yellow blotch of lichen upon the grey wall the drawn blind and the smokeless chimney howev gave it a stricken look as though the weight of this horror still lay heavi upon it we call at the door when the maid at holm request show us the boot which her master wore at the time of his death and also a pair of the son though not the pair which he had then had have measur these veri care from seven or eight differ point holm desir to be led to the court yard from which we all follow the wind track which led to boscomb pool sherlock holm was transform when he was hot upon such a scent as this men who had onli known the quiet thinker and logician of baker street would have fail to recognis him his face flush and darken his brow were drawn into two hard black line while his eye shone out from beneath them with a steeli glitter his face was bent downward his shoulder bow his lip compress and the vein stood out like whipcord in his long sinewi neck his nostril seem to dilat with a pure anim lust for the chase and his mind was so absolut concentr upon the matter befor him that a question or remark fell unheed upon his ear or at the most onli provok a quick impati snarl in repli swift and silent he made his way along the track which ran through the meadow and so by way of the wood to the boscomb pool it was damp marshi ground as is all that district and there were mark of mani feet both upon the path and amid the short grass which bound it on either side sometim holm would hurri on sometim stop dead and onc he made quit a littl detour into the meadow lestrad and i walk behind him the detect indiffer and contemptu while i watch my friend with the interest which sprang from the convict that everi one of his action was direct toward a definit end the boscomb pool which is a littl reed girt sheet of water some fifti yard across is situat at the boundari between the hatherley farm and the privat park of the wealthi mr turner abov the wood which line it upon the farther side we could see the red jut pinnacl which mark the site of the rich landown dwell on the hatherley side of the pool the wood grew veri thick and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenti pace across between the edg of the tree and the reed which line the lake lestrad show us the exact spot at which the bodi had been found and inde so moist was the ground that i could plain see the trace which had been left by the fall of the stricken man to holm as i could see by his eager face and peer eye veri mani other thing were to be read upon the trampl grass he ran round like a dog who is pick up a scent and then turn upon my companion what did you go into the pool for he ask i fish about with a rake i thought there might be some weapon or other trace but how on earth oh tut tut i have no time that left foot of your with it inward twist is all over the place a mole could trace it and there it vanish among the reed oh how simpl it would all have been had i been here befor they came like a herd of buffalo and wallow all over it here is where the parti with the lodg keeper came and they have cover all track for six or eight feet round the bodi but here are three separ track of the same feet he drew out a len and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view talk all the time rather to himself than to us these are young mccarthi feet twice he was walk and onc he ran swift so that the sole are deepli mark and the heel hard visibl that bear out his stori he ran when he saw his father on the ground then here are the father feet as he pace up and down what is this then it is the butt end of the gun as the son stood listen and this ha ha what have we here tipto tipto squar too quit unusu boot they come they go they come againof cours that was for the cloak now where did they come from he ran up and down sometim lose sometim find the track until we were well within the edg of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech the largest tree in the neighbourhood holm trace his way to the farther side of this and lay down onc more upon his face with a littl cri of satisfact for a long time he remain there turn over the leav and dri stick gather up what seem to me to be dust into an envelop and examin with his len not onli the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach a jag stone was lie among the moss and this also he care examin and retain then he follow a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad where all trace were lost it has been a case of consider interest he remark return to his natur manner i fanci that this grey hous on the right must be the lodg i think that i will go in and have a word with moran and perhap write a littl note have done that we may drive back to our luncheon you may walk to the cab and i shall be with you present it was about ten minut befor we regain our cab and drove back into ross holm still carri with him the stone which he had pick up in the wood this may interest you lestrad he remark hold it out the murder was done with it i see no mark there are none how do you know then the grass was grow under it it had onli lain there a few day there was no sign of a place whenc it had been taken it correspond with the injuri there is no sign of ani other weapon and the murder is a tall man left hand limp with the right leg wear thick sole shoot boot and a grey cloak smoke indian cigar use a cigar holder and carri a blunt pen knife in his pocket there are sever other indic but these may be enough to aid us in our search lestrad laugh i am afraid that i am still a sceptic he said theori are all veri well but we have to deal with a hard head british juri nous verron answer holm calm you work your own method and i shall work mine i shall be busi this afternoon and shall probabl return to london by the even train and leav your case unfinish no finish but the mysteri it is solv who was the crimin then the gentleman i describ but who is he sure it would not be difficult to find out this is not such a popul neighbourhood lestrad shrug his shoulder i am a practic man he said and i realli cannot undertak to go about the countri look for a left hand gentleman with a game leg i should becom the laugh stock of scotland yard all right said holm quiet i have given you the chanc here are your lodg good bye i shall drop you a line befor i leav have left lestrad at his room we drove to our hotel where we found lunch upon the tabl holm was silent and buri in thought with a pain express upon his face as one who find himself in a perplex posit look here watson he said when the cloth was clear just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a littl i dont know quit what to do and i should valu your advic light a cigar and let me expound pray do so well now in consid this case there are two point about young mccarthi narrat which struck us both instant although they impress me in his favour and you against him one was the fact that his father should accord to his account cri cooee befor see him the other was his singular die refer to a rat he mumbl sever word you understand but that was all that caught the son ear now from this doubl point our research must commenc and we will begin it by presum that what the lad say is absolut true what of this cooee then well obvious it could not have been meant for the son the son as far as he knew was in bristol it was mere chanc that he was within earshot the cooee was meant to attract the attent of whoever it was that he had the appoint with but cooee is a distinct australian cri and one which is use between australian there is a strong presumpt that the person whom mccarthi expect to meet him at boscomb pool was someon who had been in australia what of the rat then sherlock holm took a fold paper from his pocket and flatten it out on the tabl this is a map of the coloni of victoria he said i wire to bristol for it last night he put his hand over part of the map what do you read arat i read and now he rais his hand ballarat quit so that was the word the man utter and of which his son onli caught the last two syllabl he was tri to utter the name of his murder so and so of ballarat it is wonder i exclaim it is obvious and now you see i had narrow the field down consider the possess of a grey garment was a third point which grant the son statement to be correct was a certainti we have come now out of mere vagu to the definit concept of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak certain and one who was at home in the district for the pool can onli be approach by the farm or by the estat where stranger could hard wander quit so then come our expedit of to day by an examin of the ground i gain the trifl detail which i gave to that imbecil lestrad as to the person of the crimin but how did you gain them you know my method it is found upon the observ of trifl his height i know that you might rough judg from the length of his stride his boot too might be told from their trace yes they were peculiar boot but his lame the impress of his right foot was alway less distinct than his left he put less weight upon it whi becaus he limpedh was lame but his left handed you were yourself struck by the natur of the injuri as record by the surgeon at the inquest the blow was struck from immedi behind and yet was upon the left side now how can that be unless it were by a left hand man he had stood behind that tree dure the interview between the father and son he had even smoke there i found the ash of a cigar which my special knowledg of tobacco ash enabl me to pronounc as an indian cigar i have as you know devot some attent to this and written a littl monograph on the ash of 140 differ varieti of pipe cigar and cigarett tobacco have found the ash i then look round and discov the stump among the moss where he had toss it it was an indian cigar of the varieti which are roll in rotterdam and the cigar holder i could see that the end had not been in his mouth therefor he use a holder the tip had been cut off not bitten off but the cut was not a clean one so i deduc a blunt pen knife holm i said you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escap and you have save an innoc human life as truli as if you had cut the cord which was hang him i see the direct in which all this point the culprit is mr john turner cri the hotel waiter open the door of our sit room and usher in a visitor the man who enter was a strang and impress figur his slow limp step and bow shoulder gave the appear of decrepitud and yet his hard deep line craggi featur and his enorm limb show that he was possess of unusu strength of bodi and of charact his tangl beard grizzl hair and outstand droop eyebrow combin to give an air of digniti and power to his appear but his face was of an ashen white while his lip and the corner of his nostril were ting with a shade of blue it was clear to me at a glanc that he was in the grip of some dead and chronic diseas pray sit down on the sofa said holm gentl you had my note yes the lodg keeper brought it up you said that you wish to see me here to avoid scandal i thought peopl would talk if i went to the hall and whi did you wish to see me he look across at my companion with despair in his weari eye as though his question was alreadi answer yes said holm answer the look rather than the word it is so i know all about mccarthi the old man sank his face in his hand god help me he cri but i would not have let the young man come to harm i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assiz i am glad to hear you say so said holm grave i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl it would break her heartit will break her heart when she hear that i am arrest it may not come to that said holm what i am no offici agent i understand that it was your daughter who requir my presenc here and i am act in her interest young mccarthi must be got off howev i am a die man said old turner i have had diabet for year my doctor say it is a question whether i shall live a month yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol holm rose and sat down at the tabl with his pen in his hand and a bundl of paper befor him just tell us the truth he said i shall jot down the fact you will sign it and watson here can wit it then i could produc your confess at the last extrem to save young mccarthi i promis you that i shall not use it unless it is absolut need it as well said the old man it a question whether i shall live to the assiz so it matter littl to me but i should wish to spare alic the shock and now i will make the thing clear to you it has been a long time in the act but will not take me long to tell you didnt know this dead man mccarthi he was a devil incarn i tell you that god keep you out of the clutch of such a man as he his grip has been upon me these twenti year and he has blast my life ill tell you first how i came to be in his power it was in the earli 60s at the dig i was a young chap then hot blood and reckless readi to turn my hand at anyth i got among bad companion took to drink had no luck with my claim took to the bush and in a word becam what you would call over here a highway robber there were six of us and we had a wild free life of it stick up a station from time to time or stop the wagon on the road to the dig black jack of ballarat was the name i went under and our parti is still rememb in the coloni as the ballarat gang one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourn and we lay in wait for it and attack it there were six trooper and six of us so it was a close thing but we empti four of their saddl at the first volley three of our boy were kill howev befor we got the swag i put my pistol to the head of the wagon driver who was this veri man mccarthi i wish to the lord that i had shot him then but i spare him though i saw his wick littl eye fix on my face as though to rememb everi featur we got away with the gold becam wealthi men and made our way over to england without be suspect there i part from my old pal and determin to settl down to a quiet and respect life i bought this estat which chanc to be in the market and i set myself to do a littl good with my money to make up for the way in which i had earn it i marri too and though my wife die young she left me my dear littl alic even when she was just a babi her wee hand seem to lead me down the right path as noth els had ever done in a word i turn over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past all was go well when mccarthi laid his grip upon me i had gone up to town about an invest and i met him in regent street with hard a coat to his back or a boot to his foot here we are jack say he touch me on the arm well be as good as a famili to you there two of us me and my son and you can have the keep of us if you dontit a fine law abid countri is england and there alway a policeman within hail well down they came to the west countri there was no shake them off and there they have live rent free on my best land ever sinc there was no rest for me no peac no forget turn where i would there was his cun grin face at my elbow it grew wors as alic grew up for he soon saw i was more afraid of her know my past than of the polic whatev he want he must have and whatev it was i gave him without question land money hous until at last he ask a thing which i could not give he ask for alic his son you see had grown up and so had my girl and as i was known to be in weak health it seem a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole properti but there i was firm i would not have his curs stock mix with mine not that i had ani dislik to the lad but his blood was in him and that was enough i stood firm mccarthi threaten i brave him to do his worst we were to meet at the pool midway between our hous to talk it over when i went down there i found him talk with his son so i smoke a cigar and wait behind a tree until he should be alon but as i listen to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seem to come uppermost he was urg his son to marri my daughter with as littl regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the street it drove me mad to think that i and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this could i not snap the bond i was alreadi a die and a desper man though clear of mind and fair strong of limb i knew that my own fate was seal but my memori and my girl both could be save if i could but silenc that foul tongu i did it mr holm i would do it again deepli as i have sin i have led a life of martyrdom to aton for it but that my girl should be entangl in the same mesh which held me was more than i could suffer i struck him down with no more compunct than if he had been some foul and venom beast his cri brought back his son but i had gain the cover of the wood though i was forc to go back to fetch the cloak which i had drop in my flight that is the true stori gentlemen of all that occur well it is not for me to judg you said holm as the old man sign the statement which had been drawn out i pray that we may never be expos to such a temptat i pray not sir and what do you intend to do in view of your health noth you are yourself awar that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assiz i will keep your confess and if mccarthi is condemn i shall be forc to use it if not it shall never be seen by mortal eye and your secret whether you be aliv or dead shall be safe with us farewel then said the old man solemn your own deathb when they come will be the easier for the thought of the peac which you have given to mine totter and shake in all his giant frame he stumbl slowli from the room god help us said holm after a long silenc whi doe fate play such trick with poor helpless worm i never hear of such a case as this that i do not think of baxter word and say there but for the grace of god goe sherlock holm jame mccarthi was acquit at the assiz on the strength of a number of object which had been drawn out by holm and submit to the defend counsel old turner live for seven month after our interview but he is now dead and there is everi prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happili togeth in ignor of the black cloud which rest upon their past adventur v the five orang pip when i glanc over my note and record of the sherlock holm case between the year 82 and 90 i am face by so mani which present strang and interest featur that it is no easi matter to know which to choos and which to leav some howev have alreadi gain public through the paper and other have not offer a field for those peculiar qualiti which my friend possess in so high a degre and which it is the object of these paper to illustr some too have baffl his analyt skill and would be as narrat begin without an end while other have been but partial clear up and have their explan found rather upon conjectur and surmis than on that absolut logic proof which was so dear to him there is howev one of these last which was so remark in it detail and so startl in it result that i am tempt to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are point in connect with it which never have been and probabl never will be entir clear up the year 87 furnish us with a long seri of case of greater or less interest of which i retain the record among my head under this one twelv month i find an account of the adventur of the paradol chamber of the amateur mendic societi who held a luxuri club in the lower vault of a furnitur warehous of the fact connect with the loss of the british barqu sophi anderson of the singular adventur of the grice paterson in the island of uffa and final of the camberwel poison case in the latter as may be rememb sherlock holm was abl by wind up the dead man watch to prove that it had been wound up two hour befor and that therefor the deceas had gone to bed within that timea deduct which was of the greatest import in clear up the case all these i may sketch out at some futur date but none of them present such singular featur as the strang train of circumst which i have now taken up my pen to describ it was in the latter day of septemb and the equinocti gale had set in with except violenc all day the wind had scream and the rain had beaten against the window so that even here in the heart of great hand made london we were forc to rais our mind for the instant from the routin of life and to recognis the presenc of those great element forc which shriek at mankind through the bar of his civilis like untam beast in a cage as even drew in the storm grew higher and louder and the wind cri and sob like a child in the chimney sherlock holm sat moodili at one side of the fireplac cross index his record of crime while i at the other was deep in one of clark russel fine sea stori until the howl of the gale from without seem to blend with the text and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea wave my wife was on a visit to her mother and for a few day i was a dweller onc more in my old quarter at baker street whi said i glanc up at my companion that was sure the bell who could come to night some friend of your perhap except yourself i have none he answer i do not encourag visitor a client then if so it is a serious case noth less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour but i take it that it is more like to be some croni of

state and his reason for leav them was his avers to the negro and his dislik of the republican polici in extend the franchis to them he was a singular man fierc and quick temper veri foul mouth when he was angri and of a most retir disposit dure all the year that he live at horsham i doubt if ever he set foot in the town he had a garden and two or three field round his hous and there he would take his exercis though veri often for week on end he would never leav his room he drank a great deal of brandi and smoke veri heavili but he would see no societi and did not want ani friend not even his own brother he didnt mind me in fact he took a fanci to me for at the time when he saw me first i was a youngster of twelv or so this would be in the year 1878 after he had been eight or nine year in england he beg my father to let me live with him and he was veri kind to me in his way when he was sober he use to be fond of play backgammon and draught with me and he would make me his repres both with the servant and with the tradespeopl so that by the time that i was sixteen i was quit master of the hous i kept all the key and could go where i like and do what i like so long as i did not disturb him in his privaci there was one singular except howev for he had a singl room a lumber room up among the attic which was invari lock and which he would never permit either me or anyon els to enter with a boy curios i have peep through the keyhol but i was never abl to see more than such a collect of old trunk and bundl as would be expect in such a room one dayit was in march 1883a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the tabl in front of the colonel plate it was not a common thing for him to receiv letter for his bill were all paid in readi money and he had no friend of ani sort from

then my god my god my sin have overtaken me what is it uncl i cri death said he and rise from the tabl he retir to his room leav me palpit with horror i took up the envelop and saw scrawl in red ink upon the inner flap just abov the gum the letter k three time repeat there was noth els save the five dri pip what could be the reason of his overpow terror i left the breakfast tabl and as i ascend the stair i met him come down with an old rusti key which must have belong to the attic in one hand and a small brass box like a cashbox in the other they may do what they like but ill checkmat them still said he with an oath tell mari that i shall want a fire in my room to day and send down to fordham the horsham lawyer i did as he order and when the lawyer arriv i was ask to step up to the room the fire was burn bright and in the grate there was a mass of black fluffi ash as of burn paper while the brass box stood open and empti besid it as i glanc at the box i notic with a start that upon

the sensat grew less keen as the week pass and noth happen to disturb the usual routin of our live i could see a chang in my uncl howev he drank more than ever and he was less inclin for ani sort of societi most of his time he would spend in his room with the door lock upon the insid but sometim he would emerg in a sort of drunken frenzi and would burst out of the hous and tear about the garden with a revolv in his hand scream out that he was afraid of no man and that he was not to be coop up like a sheep in a pen by man or devil when these hot fit were over howev he would rush tumultu in at the door and lock and bar it behind him like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lie at the root of his soul at such time i have seen his face even on a cold day glisten with moistur as though it were new rais from a basin well to come to an end of the matter mr holm and not to abus your patienc there came a night when he made one of those drunken salli from which he never came back we found him when we went to search for him face downward in a littl green scum pool which lay at the foot of the garden there was no sign of ani violenc and the water was but two feet deep so that the juri have regard to his known eccentr brought in a verdict of suicid but i who knew how he winc from the veri thought of death had much ado to persuad myself that he had gone out of

a heart which was full of forebod on the third day after the come of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his major freebodi who is in command of one of the fort upon portsdown hill i was glad that he should go for it seem to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home in that howev i was in error upon the second day of his absenc i receiv a

bring in a verdict of death from accident caus care as i examin everi fact connect with his death i was unabl to find anyth which could suggest the idea of murder there were no sign of violenc no footmark no robberi no record of stranger have been seen upon the road and yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at eas and that i was well nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him in this sinist way i came into my inherit you will ask me whi i did not dispos of it i answer becaus i was well convinc that our troubl were in some way depend upon an incid in my uncl life and that the danger would be as press in one hous as in anoth it was in januari 85 that my poor father met his end and two year and eight month have elaps sinc then dure that time i have live happili at horsham and i had begun to hope that this curs had pass away from the famili and that it had end with the last generat i had begun to take comfort too soon howev yesterday morn the blow fell in the

no foresight and no precaut can guard against tut tut cri sherlock holm you must act man or you are lost noth but energi can save you this is no time for despair i have seen the polic ah but they listen to my stori with a smile i am convinc that the inspector has form the opinion that the letter are all practic joke and that the death of my relat were realli accid as the juri state and were not to be connect with the warn holm shook his clench hand in the air incred imbecil he cri they have howev allow me a policeman who may remain in the hous with me has he come with you to night no his

remembr said he that on the day when my uncl burn the paper i observ that the small unburn margin which lay amid the ash were of this particular colour i found this singl sheet upon the floor of his room and i am inclin to think that it may be one of the paper which has perhap flutter out from among the other and in that way has escap destruct beyond the mention of pip i do not see that it help us much i think myself that it is a page from some privat diari the write is undoubt my uncl holm move the lamp and we both bent over the sheet of paper which show by it rag edg that it had inde been torn from a book it was head march 1869 and beneath were the follow enigmat notic 4th hudson came same old platform 7th set the pip on mccauley paramor and john swain of st augustin 9th mccauley clear

discuss what you have told me you must get home instant and act what shall i do there is but one thing to do it must be done at onc you must put this piec of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have describ you must also put in a note to say that all the other paper were burn by your uncl and that this is the onli one which remain you must assert that in such word as will carri convict with them have done this you must at onc put the box out upon the sundial as direct do you understand entir do not think of reveng or anyth of the sort at present i think that we may

hand with us and took his leav outsid the wind still scream and the rain splash and patter against the window this strang wild stori seem to have come to us from amid the mad elementsblown in upon us like a sheet of sea weed in a galeand now to have been reabsorb by them onc more sherlock holm sat for some time in silenc with his head sunk forward and his eye bent upon the red glow of the fire then he lit his pipe and lean back in his chair he watch the blue smoke ring as they chase each other up to the ceil i think watson he remark at last that of all our case we have had none more fantast than this save perhap the sign of four well yes save perhap that and yet this john openshaw seem to me to be walk amid even greater peril than did the sholto but have you i ask form ani definit concept as to what these peril are there can be no question as to their natur he answer then what are they who is this k k k and whi doe he pursu this unhappi famili sherlock holm close his eye and place his elbow upon the arm of his chair with his finger tip togeth the ideal reason he remark would when he had onc been shown a singl fact in all it bear deduc from it not onli all the chain of event which led up to it but also all the result which would follow from it as cuvier could correct describ a whole anim by the contempl of a singl bone so the observ who has thorough understood one link in a seri of incid should be abl to accur state all the other one both befor and after we have not yet grasp the result which the reason alon can attain to problem may be solv in the studi which have baffl all those who have sought a solut by the aid of their sens to carri the art howev to it highest pitch it is necessari that the reason should be abl to utilis all the fact which have come to his knowledg and this in itself impli as you will readili see a possess of all knowledg which even in these day of free educ and encyclopaedia is a somewhat rare accomplish it is not so imposs howev that a man should possess all knowledg which is like to be use to him in his work and this i have endeavour in my case to do if i rememb right you on one occas in the earli day of our friendship defin my limit in a veri precis fashion yes i answer laugh it was a singular document philosophi astronomi and polit were mark at zero i rememb botani variabl geolog profound as regard the mud stain from ani region within fifti mile of town chemistri eccentr anatomi unsystemat sensat literatur and crime record uniqu violin player boxer swordsman lawyer and self poison by cocain and tobacco those i think were the main point of my analysi holm grin at the last item well he said i say now as i said then that a man should keep his littl brain attic stock with all the furnitur that he is like to use and the rest he can put away in the lumber room of his librari where he can get it if he want it now for such a case as the one which has been submit to us to night we need certain to muster all our resourc kind hand me down the letter k of the american encyclopaedia which stand upon the shelf besid you thank you now let us consid the situat and see what may be deduc from it in the first place we may start with a strong presumpt that colonel openshaw had some veri strong reason for leav america men at his time of life do not chang all their habit and exchang will the charm climat of florida for the lone life of an english provinci town his extrem love of solitud in england suggest the idea that he was in fear of someon or someth so we may assum as a work hypothesi that it was fear of someon or someth which drove him from america as to what it was he fear we can onli deduc that by consid the formid letter which were receiv by himself and his successor did you remark the postmark of those letter the first was from pondicherri the second from dunde and the third from london from east london what do you deduc from that they are all seaport that the writer was on board of a ship excel we have alreadi a clue there can be no doubt that the probabilityth strong probabilityi that the writer was on board of a ship and now let us consid anoth point in the case of pondicherri seven week elaps between the threat and it fulfil in dunde it was onli some three or four day doe that suggest anyth a greater distanc to travel but the letter had also a greater distanc to come then i do not see the point there is at least a presumpt that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sail ship it look as if they alway send their singular warn or token befor them when start upon their mission you see how quick the deed follow the sign when it came from dunde if they had come from pondicherri in a steamer they would have arriv almost as soon as their letter but as a matter of fact seven week elaps i think that those seven week repres the differ between the mail boat which brought the letter and the sail vessel which brought the writer it is possibl more than that it is probabl and now you see the dead urgenc of this new case and whi i urg young openshaw to caution the blow has alway fallen at the end of the time which it would take the sender to travel the distanc but this one come from london and therefor we cannot count upon delay good god i cri what can it mean this relentless persecut the paper which openshaw carri are obvious of vital import to the person or person in the sail ship i think that it is quit clear that there must be more than one of them a singl man could not have carri out two death in such a way as to deceiv a coron juri there must have been sever in it and they must have been men of resourc and determin their paper they mean to have be the holder of them who it may in this way you see k k k ceas to be the initi of an individu and becom the badg of a societi but of what societi have you never said sherlock holm bend forward and sink his voicehav you never heard of the ku klux klan i never have holm turn over the leav of the book upon his knee here it is said he present ku klux klan a name deriv from the fanci resembl to the sound produc by cock a rifl this terribl secret societi was form by some ex confeder soldier in the southern state after the civil war and it rapid form local branch in differ part of the countri notabl in tennesse louisiana the carolina georgia and florida it power was use for polit purpos princip for the terroris of the negro voter and the murder and drive from the countri of those who were oppos to it view it outrag were usual preced by a warn sent to the mark man in some fantast but general recognis shapea sprig of oak leav in some part melon seed or orang pip in other on receiv this the victim might either open abjur his former way or might fli from the countri if he brave the matter out death would unfail come upon him and usual in some strang and unforeseen manner so perfect was the organis of the societi and so systemat it method that there is hard a case upon record where ani man succeed in brave it with impun or in which ani of it outrag were trace home to the perpetr for some year the organis flourish in spite of the effort of the unit state govern and of the better class of the communiti in the south eventu in the year 1869 the movement rather sudden collaps although there have been sporad outbreak of the same sort sinc that date you will observ said holm lay down the volum that the sudden break up of the societi was coincid with the disappear of openshaw from america with their paper it may well have been caus and effect it is no wonder that he and his famili have some of the more implac spirit upon their track you can understand that this regist and diari may implic some of the first men in the south and that there may be mani who will not sleep easi at night until it is recov then the page we have seen is such as we might expect it ran if i rememb right sent the pip to a b and cthat is sent the societi warn to them then there are success entri that a and b clear or left the countri and final that c was visit with i fear a sinist result for c well i think doctor that we may let some light into this dark place and i believ that the onli chanc young openshaw has in the meantim is to do what i have told him there is noth more to be said or to be done to night so hand me over my violin and let us tri to forget for half an hour the miser weather and the still more miser way of our fellow men it had clear in the morn and the sun was shine with a subdu bright through the dim veil which hang over the great citi sherlock holm was alreadi at breakfast when i came down you will excus me for not wait for you said he i have i forese a veri busi day befor me in look into this case of young openshaw what step will you take i ask it will veri much depend upon the result of my first inquiri i may have to go down to horsham after all you will not go there first no i shall commenc with the citi just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffe as i wait i lift the unopen newspap from the tabl and glanc my eye over it it rest upon a head which sent a chill to my heart holm i cri you are too late ah said he lay down his cup i fear as much how was it done he spoke calm but i could see that he was deepli move my eye caught the name of openshaw and the head tragedi near waterloo bridg here is the account between nine and ten last night polic constabl cook of the h divis on duti near waterloo bridg heard a cri for help and a splash in the water the night howev was extrem dark and stormi so that in spite of the help of sever passer by it

which was found in his pocket was john openshaw and whose resid is near horsham it is conjectur that he may have been hurri down to catch the last train from waterloo station and that in his hast and the extrem dark he miss his path and walk over the edg of one of the small land place for river steamboat the bodi exhibit no trace of violenc and there can be no doubt that the deceas had been the victim of an unfortun accid which should have the effect of call the attent of the author to the condit of the riversid land stage we sat in silenc for some minut holm more depress and shaken than i had ever seen him that hurt my pride watson he said at last it is a petti feel no doubt but it hurt my pride it becom a person matter with me now and if god send me health i shall set my hand upon

inform that of late he had when the fit was on him made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the citi hitherto his orgi had alway been confin to one day and he had come back twitch and shatter in the even but now the spell had been upon him eight and forti hour and he lay there doubtless among the dreg of the dock breath in the poison or sleep off the effect there he was to be found she was sure of it at the bar of gold in upper swandam lane but what was she to do how could she a young and timid woman make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffian who

case clear and concis to you watson and mayb you can see a spark where all is dark to me proceed then some year agoto be definit in may 1884there came to lee a gentleman nevill st clair by name who appear to have plenti of money he took a larg villa laid out the ground veri nice and live general in good style by degre he made friend in the neighbourhood and in 1887 he marri the daughter of a local brewer by whom he now has two children he had no occup but was interest in sever compani and went into town as a rule in the morn return by the 514 from cannon street everi night mr st clair is now thirti seven year of age is a man of temper habit a good husband a veri affection father and a man who is popular with all who know him i may add that his whole debt at the present moment as far as we have been abl to ascertain amount to 88 pound 10s while he has 220 pound stand to his credit in the capit and counti bank there is no reason therefor to think that money troubl have been weigh upon his mind last monday mr nevill st clair went into town rather earlier than usual remark befor he start that he had two import commiss to perform and that he would bring his littl boy home a box of brick now by the merest chanc his wife receiv a telegram upon this same monday veri short after his departur to the effect that a small parcel of consider valu which she had been expect was wait for her at the offic of the aberdeen ship compani now if you are well up in your london you will know that the offic of the compani is in fresno street which branch out of upper swandam lane where you found me to night mrs st clair had her lunch start for the citi did some shop proceed to the compani offic got her packet and found herself at exact 435 walk through swandam lane on her way back to the station have you follow me so far it is veri clear if you rememb monday was an exceed hot day and mrs st clair walk slowli glanc about in the hope of see a cab as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself while she was walk in this way down swandam lane she sudden heard an ejacul or cri and was struck cold to see her husband look down at her and as it seem to her beckon to her from a second floor window the window was open and she distinct saw his face which she describ as be terribl agit he wave his hand frantic to her and then vanish from the window so sudden that it seem to her that he had been pluck back by some irresist forc from behind one singular point which struck her quick feminin eye was that although he wore some dark coat such as he had start to town in he had on neither collar nor neckti convinc that someth was amiss with him she rush down the stepsfor the hous was none other than the opium den in which you found me to nightand run through the front room she attempt to ascend the stair which led to the first floor at the foot of the stair howev she met this lascar scoundrel of whom i have spoken who thrust her back and aid by a dane who act as assist there push her out into the street fill with the most madden doubt and fear she rush down the lane and by rare good fortun met in fresno street a number of constabl with an inspector all on their way to their beat the inspector and two men accompani her back and in spite of the continu resist of the proprietor they made their way to the room in which mr st clair had last been seen there was no sign of him there in fact in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippl wretch of hideous aspect who it seem made his home there both he and the lascar stout swore that no one els had been in the front room dure the afternoon so determin was their denial that the inspector was stagger and had almost come to believ that mrs st clair had been delud when with a cri she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the tabl and tore the lid from it out there fell a cascad of children brick it was the toy which he had promis to bring home this discoveri and the evid confus which the crippl show made the inspector realis that the matter was serious the room were care examin and result all point to an abomin crime the front room was plain furnish as a sit room and led into a small bedroom which look out upon the back of one of the wharv between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip which is dri at low tide but is cover at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water the bedroom window was a broad one and open from below on examin trace of blood were to be seen upon the windowsil and sever scatter drop were visibl upon the wooden floor of the bedroom thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the cloth of mr nevill st clair with the except of his coat his boot his sock his hat and his watchal were there there were no sign of violenc upon ani of these garment and there were no other trace of mr nevill st clair out of the window he must appar have gone for no other exit could be discov and the omin bloodstain upon the sill gave littl promis that he could save himself by swim for the tide was at it veri highest at the moment of the tragedi and now as to the villain who seem to be immedi implic in the matter the lascar was known to be a man of the vilest anteced but as by mrs st clair stori he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a veri few second of her husband appear at the window he could hard have been more than an accessori to the crime his defenc was one of absolut ignor and he protest that he had no knowledg as to the do of hugh boon his lodger and that he could not account in ani way for the presenc of the miss gentleman cloth so much for the lascar manag now for the sinist crippl who live upon the second floor of the opium den and who was certain the last human be whose eye rest upon nevill st clair his name is hugh boon and his hideous face is one which is familiar to everi man who goe much to the citi he is a profession beggar though in order to avoid the polic regul he pretend to a small trade in wax vesta some littl distanc down threadneedl street upon the left hand side there is as you may have remark a small angl in the wall here it is that this creatur take his daili seat cross leg with his tini stock of match on his lap and as he is a piteous spectacl a small rain of chariti descend into the greasi leather cap which lie upon the pavement besid him i have watch the fellow more than onc befor ever i thought of make his profession acquaint and i have been surpris at the harvest which he has reap in a short time his appear you see is so remark that no one can pass him without observ him a shock of orang hair a pale face disfigur by a horribl scar which by it contract has turn up the outer edg of his upper lip a bulldog chin and a pair of veri penetr dark eye which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendic and so too doe his wit for he is ever readi with a repli to ani piec of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passer by this is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest but a crippl said i what could he have done singl hand against a man in the prime of life he is a crippl in the sens that he walk with a limp but in other respect he appear to be a power and well nurtur man sure your medic experi would tell you watson that weak in one limb is often compens for by except strength in the other pray continu your narrat mrs st clair had faint at the sight of the blood upon the window and she was escort home in a cab by the polic as her presenc could be of no help to them in their investig inspector barton who had charg of the case made a veri care examin of the premis but without find anyth which threw ani light upon the matter one mistak had been made in not arrest boon instant as he was allow some few minut dure which he might have communic with his friend the lascar but this fault was soon remedi and he was seiz and search without anyth be found which could incrimin him there were it is true some blood stain upon his right shirt sleev but he point to his ring finger which had been cut near the nail and explain that the bleed came from there ad that he had been to the window not long befor and that the stain which had been observ there came doubtless from the same sourc he deni strenuous have ever seen mr nevill st clair and swore that the presenc of the cloth in his room was as much a mysteri to him as to the polic as to mrs st clair assert that she had actual seen her husband at the window he declar that she must have been either mad or dream he was remov loud protest to the polic station while the inspector remain upon the premis in the hope that the eb tide might afford some fresh clue and it did though they hard found upon the mud bank what they had fear to find it was nevill st clair coat and not nevill st clair which lay uncov as the tide reced and what do you think they found in the pocket i cannot imagin no i dont think you would guess everi pocket stuf with penni and half pennies421 penni and 270 half penni it was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide but a human bodi is a differ matter there is a fierc eddi between the wharf and the hous it seem like enough that the weight coat had remain when the strip bodi had been suck away into the river but i understand that all the other cloth were found in the room would the bodi be dress in a coat alon no sir but the fact might be met specious enough suppos that this man boon had thrust nevill st clair through the window there is no human eye which could have seen the deed what would he do then it would of cours instant strike him that he must get rid of the tell tale garment he would seiz the coat then and be in the act of throw it out when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink he has littl time for he has heard the scuffl downstair when the wife tri to forc her way up and perhap he has alreadi heard from his lascar confeder that the polic are hurri up the street there is not an instant to be lost he rush to some secret hoard where he has accumul the fruit of his beggari and he stuff all the coin upon which he can lay his hand into the pocket to make sure of the coat sink he throw it out and would have done the same with the other garment had not he heard the rush of step below and onli just had time to close the window when the polic appear it certain sound feasibl well we will take it as a work hypothesi for want of a better boon as i have told you was arrest and taken to the station but it could not be shown that there had ever befor been anyth against him he had for year been known as a profession beggar but his life appear to have been a veri quiet and innoc one there the matter stand at present and the question which have to be solvedwhat nevill st clair was do in the opium den what happen to him when there where is he now and what hugh boon had to do with his disappearancear all as far from a solut as ever i confess that i cannot recal ani case within my experi which look at the first glanc so simpl and yet which present such difficulti while sherlock holm had been detail this singular seri of event we had been whirl through the outskirt of the great town until the last straggl hous had been left behind and we rattl along with a countri hedg upon either side of us just as he finish howev we drove through two scatter villag

ten day i had the money and had paid the debt well you can imagin how hard it was to settl down to arduous work at 2 pound a week when i knew that i could earn as much in a day by smear my face with a littl paint lay my cap on the ground and sit still it was a long fight between my pride and the money but the dollar won at last and i threw up report and sat day after day in the corner which i had first chosen inspir piti by my ghast face and fill my pocket with copper onli one man knew my secret he was the keeper of a low den in which i use to lodg in swandam lane where i could everi morn

heard her voic downstair but i knew that she could not ascend swift i threw off my cloth pull on those of a beggar and put on my pigment and wig even a wife eye could not pierc so complet a disguis but then it occur to me that there might be a search in the room and that the cloth might betray me i threw open the window reopen by my violenc a small cut which i had inflict upon myself in the

my wife would be terribl anxious i slip off my ring and confid it to the lascar at a moment when no constabl was watch me togeth with a hurri scrawl tell her that she had no caus to fear that note onli reach her yesterday said holm good god what a week she must have spent the polic have watch this lascar said inspector bradstreet and i can quit understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserv probabl he hand it to some sailor custom of his who forgot all about it for some day that was it said holm nod approv i have no doubt of it but have you never been prosecut for beg mani time but what was a fine to me it must stop here howev said bradstreet if the polic are to hush this thing up there must be no more of hugh boon i have sworn it by the most solemn oath which a man can take in that case i think that it is probabl that no further step may be taken but if you are found again then all must come out i am sure mr holm that we are veri much indebt to you for have clear the matter up i wish i knew how you reach your result i reach this one said my friend by sit upon five pillow and consum an ounc of shag i think watson that if we drive to baker street we shall just be in time for breakfast vii the adventur of the blue carbuncl i had call upon my friend sherlock holm upon the second morn after christma with the intent of wish him the compliment of the season he was loung upon the sofa in a purpl dress gown a pipe rack within his reach upon the right and a pile of crumpl morn paper evid newli studi near at hand besid the couch was a wooden chair and on the angl of the back hung a veri seedi and disreput hard felt hat much the wors for wear and crack in sever place a len and a forcep lie upon the seat of the chair suggest that the hat had been suspend in this manner for the purpos of examin you are engag said i perhap i interrupt you not at all i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my result the matter is a perfect trivial oneh jerk his thumb in the direct of the old hatbut there are point in connect with it which are not entir devoid of interest and even of instruct i seat myself in his armchair and warm my hand befor his crackl fire for a sharp frost had set in and the window were thick with the ice crystal i suppos i remark that home as it look this thing has some dead stori link on to itthat it is the clue which will guid you in the solut of some mysteri and the punish of some crime no no no crime said sherlock holm laugh onli one of those whimsic littl incid which will happen when you have four million human be all jostl each other within the space of a few squar mile amid the action and reaction of so dens a swarm of human everi possibl combin of event may be expect to take place and mani a littl problem will be present which may be strike and bizarr without be crimin we have alreadi had experi of such so much so i remark that of the last six case which i have ad to my note three have been entir free of ani legal crime precis you allud to my attempt to recov the iren adler paper to the singular case of miss mari sutherland and to the adventur of the man with the twist lip well i have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innoc categori you know peterson the commissionair yes it is to him that this trophi belong it is his hat no no he found it it owner is unknown i beg that you will look upon it not as a batter billycock but as an intellectu problem and first as to how it came here it arriv upon christma morn in compani with a good fat goos which is i have no doubt roast at this moment in front of peterson fire the fact are these about four oclock on christma morn peterson who as you know is a veri honest fellow was return from some small jollif and was make his way homeward down tottenham court road in front of him he saw in the gaslight a tallish man walk with a slight stagger and carri a white goos slung over his shoulder as he reach the corner of goodg street a row broke out between this stranger and a littl knot of rough one of the latter knock off the man hat on which he rais his stick to defend himself and swing it over his head smash the shop window behind him peterson had rush forward to protect the stranger from his assail but the man shock at have broken the window and see an offici look person in uniform rush toward him drop his goos took to his heel and vanish amid the labyrinth of small street which lie at the back of tottenham court road the rough had also fled at the appear of peterson so that he was left in possess of the field of battl and also of the spoil of victori in the shape of this batter hat and a most unimpeach christma goos which sure he restor to their owner my dear fellow there lie the problem it is true that for mrs henri baker was print upon a small card which was tie to the bird left leg and it is also true that the initi h b are legibl upon the line of this hat but as there are some thousand of baker and some hundr of henri baker in this citi of our it is not easi to restor lost properti to ani one of them what then did peterson do he brought round both hat and goos to me on christma morn know that even the smallest problem are of interest to me the goos we retain until this morn when there were sign that in spite of the slight frost it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessari delay it finder has carri it off therefor to fulfil the ultim destini of a goos while i continu to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his christma dinner did he not advertis no then what clue could you have as to his ident onli as much as we can deduc from his hat precis but you are joke what can you gather from this old batter felt here is my len you know my method what can you gather yourself as to the individu of the man who has worn this articl i took the tatter object in my hand and turn it over rather ruefulli it was a veri ordinari black hat of the usual round shape hard and much the wors for wear the line had been of red silk but was a good deal discolour there was no maker name but as holm had remark the initi h b were scrawl upon one side it was pierc in the brim for a hat secur but the elast was miss for the rest it was crack exceed dusti and spot in sever place although there seem to have been some attempt to hide the discolour patch by smear them with ink i can see noth said i hand it back to my friend on the contrari watson you can see everyth you fail howev to reason from what you see you are too timid in draw your infer then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat he pick it up and gaze at it in the peculiar introspect fashion which was characterist of him it is perhap less suggest than it might have been he remark and yet there are a few infer which are veri distinct and a few other which repres at least a strong balanc of probabl that the man was high intellectu is of cours obvious upon the face of it and also that he was fair well to do within the last three year although he has now fallen upon evil day he had foresight but has less now than former point to a moral retrogress which when taken with the declin of his fortun seem to indic some evil influenc probabl drink at work upon him this may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceas to love him my dear holm he has howev retain some degre of self respect he continu disregard my remonstr he is a man who lead a sedentari life goe out littl is out of train entir is middl age has grizzl hair which he has had cut within the last few day and which he anoint with lime cream these are the more patent fact which are to be deduc from his hat also by the way that it is extrem improb that he has gas laid on in his hous you are certain joke holm not in the least is it possibl that even now when i give you these result you are unabl to see how they are attain i have no doubt that i am veri stupid but i must confess that i am unabl to follow you for exampl how did you deduc that this man was intellectu for answer holm clap the hat upon his head it came right over the forehead and settl upon the bridg of his nose it is a question of cubic capac said he a man with so larg a brain must have someth in it the declin of his fortun then this hat is three year old these flat brim curl at the edg came in then it is a hat of the veri best qualiti look at the band of rib silk and the excel line if this man could afford to buy so expens a hat three year ago and has had no hat sinc then he has assur gone down in the world well that is clear enough certain but how about the foresight and the moral retrogress sherlock holm laugh here is the foresight said he put his finger upon the littl disc and loop of the hat secur they are never sold upon hat if this man order one it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight sinc he went out of his way to take this precaut against the wind but sinc we see that he has broken the elast and has not troubl to replac it it is obvious that he has less foresight now than former which is a distinct proof of a weaken natur on the other hand he has endeavour to conceal some of these stain upon the felt by daub them with ink which is a sign that he has not entir lost his self respect your reason is certain plausibl the further point that he is middl age that his hair is grizzl that it has been recent cut and that he use lime cream are all to be gather from a close examin of the lower part of the line the len disclos a larg number of hair end clean cut by the scissor of the barber they all appear to be adhes and there is a distinct odour of lime cream this dust you will observ is not the gritti grey dust of the street but the fluffi brown dust of the hous show that it has been hung up indoor most of the time while the mark of moistur upon the insid are proof posit that the wearer perspir veri freeli and could therefor hard be in the best of train but his wifeyou said that she had ceas to love him this hat has not been brush for week when i see you my dear watson with a week accumul of dust upon your hat and when your wife allow you to go out in such a state i shall fear that you also have been unfortun enough to lose your wife affect but he might be a bachelor nay he was bring home the goos as a peac offer to his wife rememb the card upon the bird leg you have an answer to everyth but how on earth do you deduc that the gas is not laid on in his hous one tallow stain or even two might come by chanc but when i see no less than five i think that there can be littl doubt that the individu must be brought into frequent contact with burn tallowwalk upstair at night probabl with his hat in one hand and a gutter candl in the other anyhow he never got tallow stain from a gas jet are you satisfi well it is veri ingeni said i laugh but sinc as you said just now there has been no crime commit and no harm done save the loss of a goos all this seem to be rather a wast of energi sherlock holm had open his mouth to repli when the door flew open and peterson the commissionair rush into the apart with flush cheek and the face of a man who is daze with astonish the goos mr holm the goos sir he gasp eh what of it then has it return to life and flap off through the kitchen window holm twist himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man excit face see here sir see what my wife found in it crop he held out his hand and display upon the centr of the palm a brilliant scintil blue stone rather smaller than a bean in size but of such puriti and radianc that it twinkl like an electr point in the dark hollow of his hand sherlock holm sat up with a whistl by jove peterson said he this is treasur trove inde i suppos you know what you have got a diamond sir a precious stone it cut into glass as though it were putti it more than a precious stone it is the precious stone not the countess of morcar blue carbuncl i ejacul precis so i ought to know it size and shape see that i have read the advertis about it in the time everi day late it is absolut uniqu and it valu can onli be conjectur but the reward offer of 1000 pound is certain not within a twentieth part of the market price a thousand pound great lord of merci the commissionair plump down into a chair and stare from one to the other of us that is the reward and i have reason to know that there are sentiment consider in the background which would induc the countess to part with half her fortun if she could but recov the gem it was lost if i rememb aright at the hotel cosmopolitan i remark precis so on decemb 22nd just five day ago john horner a plumber was accus of have abstract it from the ladi jewel case the evid against him was so strong that the case has been refer to the assiz i have some account of the matter here i believ he rummag amid his newspap glanc over the date until at last he smooth one out doubl it over and read the follow paragraph hotel cosmopolitan jewel robberi john horner 26 plumber was brought up upon the charg of have upon the 22nd inst abstract from the jewel case of the countess of morcar the valuabl gem known as the blue carbuncl jame ryder upper attend at the hotel gave his evid to the effect that he had shown horner up to the dress room of the countess of morcar upon the day of the robberi in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate which was loos he had remain with horner some littl time but had final been call away on return he found that horner had disappear that the bureau had been forc open and that the small morocco casket in which as it afterward transpir the countess was accustom to keep her jewel was lie empti upon the dress tabl ryder instant gave the alarm and horner was arrest the same even but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his room catherin cusack maid to the countess depos to have heard ryder cri of dismay on discov the robberi and to have rush into the room where she found matter as describ by the last wit inspector bradstreet b divis gave evid as to the arrest of horner who struggl frantic and protest his innoc in the strongest term evid of a previous convict for robberi have been given against the prison the magistr refus to deal summarili with the offenc but refer it to the assiz horner who had shown sign of intens emot dure the proceed faint away at the conclus and was carri out of court hum so much for the polic court said holm thought toss asid the paper the question for us now to solv is the sequenc of event lead from a rifl jewel case at one end to the crop of a goos in tottenham court road at the other you see watson our littl deduct have sudden assum a much more import and less innoc aspect here is the stone the stone came from the goos and the goos came from mr henri baker the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characterist with which i have bore you so now we must set ourselv veri serious to find this gentleman and ascertain what part he has play in this littl mysteri to do this we must tri the simplest mean first and these lie undoubt in an advertis in all the even paper if this fail i shall have recours to other method what will you say give me a pencil and that slip of paper now then found at the corner of goodg street a goos and a black felt hat mr henri baker can have the same by appli at 630 this even at 221b baker street that is clear and concis veri but will he see it well he is sure to keep an eye on the paper sinc to a poor man the loss was a heavi one he was clear so scare by his mischanc in break the window and by the approach of peterson that he thought of noth but flight but sinc then he must have bitter regret the impuls which caus him to drop his bird then again the introduct of his name will caus him to see it for everyon who know him will direct his attent to it here you are peterson run down to the advertis agenc and have this put in the even paper in which sir oh in the globe star pall mall st jamess even news standard echo and ani other that occur to you veri well sir and this stone ah yes i shall keep the stone thank you and i say peterson just buy a goos on your way back and leav it here with me for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your famili is now devour when the commissionair had gone holm took up the stone and held it against the light it a bonni thing said he just see how it glint and sparkl of cours it is a nucleus and focus of crime everi good stone is they are the devil pet bait in the larger and older jewel everi facet may stand for a bloodi deed this stone is not yet twenti year old it was found in the bank of the amoy river in southern china and is remark in have everi characterist of the carbuncl save that it is blue in shade instead of rubi red in spite of it youth it has alreadi a sinist histori there have been two murder a vitriol throw a suicid and sever robberi brought about for the sake of this forti grain weight of crystallis charcoal who would think that so pretti a toy would be a purveyor to the gallow and the prison ill lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the countess to say that we have it do you think that this man horner is innoc i cannot tell well then do you imagin that this other one henri baker had anyth to do with the matter it is i think much more like that henri baker is an absolut innoc man who had no idea that the bird which he was carri was of consider more valu than if it were made of solid gold that howev i shall determin by a veri simpl test if we have an answer to our advertis and you can do noth until then noth in that case i shall continu my profession round but i shall come back in the even at the hour you have mention for i should like to see the solut of so tangl a busi veri glad to see you i dine at seven there is a woodcock i believ by the way in view of recent occurr perhap i ought to ask mrs hudson to examin it crop i had been delay at a case and it was a littl after half past six when i found myself in baker street onc more as i approach the hous i saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a coat which was button up to his chin wait outsid in the bright semicircl which was thrown from the fanlight just as i arriv the door was open and we were shown up togeth to holm room mr henri baker i believ said he rise from his armchair and greet his visitor with the easi air of genial which he could so readili assum pray take this chair by the fire mr baker it is a cold night and i observ that your circul is more adapt for summer than

with the collar turn up and his lank wrist protrud from his sleev without a sign of cuff or shirt he spoke in a slow staccato fashion choos his word with care and gave the impress general of a man of learn and letter who had had ill usag at the hand of fortun we have retain these thing for some day said holm becaus we expect to see an advertis from you give your address i am at a loss to know now whi you did not advertis our visitor gave a rather shamefac laugh shill have not been so plenti with me as they onc were he remark i had no doubt that the gang of rough who assault me had carri off both my hat and the bird i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recov them veri natur by the way about the bird we were compel to eat it to eat it our visitor half rose from his chair in his excit yes it would have been of no use to anyon had we not done so but i presum that this other goos upon the sideboard which is about the same weight and perfect fresh will answer your purpos equal well oh certain certain answer mr baker with a sigh of relief of cours we still have the feather leg crop and so on of your own bird so if you wish the man burst into a hearti laugh they might be use to me as relic of my adventur said he but beyond that i can hard see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaint are go to be to me no sir i think that with your permiss i will

close alli it was a wild night the wind was howl outsid and the rain was beat and splash against the window sudden amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrifi woman i knew that it was my sister voic i sprang from my bed wrap a shawl round me and rush into the corridor as i open my door i seem to hear a low whistl such as my sister describ and a few moment later a clang sound as if a mass of metal had fallen as i ran down the passag my sister door was unlock and revolv slowli upon it hing i stare at it horror stricken not know what was about to issu from it by the light of the corridor lamp i saw my sister appear at the open her face blanch with terror her hand grope for help her whole figur sway to and fro like that of a drunkard i ran to her and threw my arm round her but at that moment her knee seem to give way and she fell to the ground she writh as one who is in terribl pain and her limb were dread convuls at first i thought that she had not recognis me but as i bent over her she sudden shriek out in a voic which i shall never forget oh my god helen it was the band the speckl band there was someth els which she would fain have said and

dress gown when he reach my sister side she was unconsci and though he pour brandi down her throat and sent for medic aid from the villag all effort were in vain for she slowli sank and die without have recov her conscious such was the dread end of my belov sister one moment said holm are you sure about this whistl and metal sound could you swear to it that was what the counti coron ask me at the inquiri it is my strong impress that i heard it and yet among the crash of the gale and the creak of an old hous i may possibl have been deceiv was your sister dress no she was in her night dress in her right hand was found the char stump of a match and in her left a match box show that she had struck a light and look about her when the alarm took place that is import and what conclus did the coron come to he investig the case with great care for dr roylott conduct had long been notori in the counti but he was unabl to find ani satisfactori caus of death my evid show that the door had been fasten upon the inner side and the window were block by old fashion shutter with broad iron bar which were secur everi night the wall were care sound and were shown to be quit solid all round and the floor was also thorough examin with the same result the chimney is wide but is bar up by four larg stapl it is certain therefor that my sister was quit alon when she met her end besid there were no mark of ani violenc upon her how about poison the doctor examin her for it but without success what do you think that this unfortun ladi die of then it is my belief that she die of pure fear and nervous shock though what it was that frighten her i cannot imagin were there gipsi in the plantat at the time yes there are near alway some there ah and what did you gather from this allus to a banda speckl band sometim i have thought that it was mere the wild talk of delirium sometim that it may have refer to some band of peopl perhap to these veri gipsi in the plantat i do not know whether the spot handkerchief which so mani of them wear over their head might have suggest the strang adject which she use holm shook his head like a man who is far from be satisfi these are veri deep water said he pray go on with your narrat two year have pass sinc then and my life has been until late loneli than ever a month ago howev a dear friend whom i have known for mani year has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriag his name is armitageperci armitageth second son of mr armitag of crane water near read my stepfath has offer no opposit to the match and we are to be marri in the cours of the spring two day ago some repair were start in the west wing of the build and my bedroom wall has been pierc so that i have had to move into the chamber in which my sister die and to sleep in the veri bed in which she slept imagin then my thrill of terror when last night as i lay awak think over her terribl fate i sudden heard in the silenc of the night the low whistl which had been the herald of her own death i sprang up and lit the lamp but noth was to be seen in the room i was too shaken to go to bed again howev so i dress and as soon as it was daylight i slip down got a dog cart at the crown inn which is opposit and drove to leatherhead from whenc i have come on this morn with the one object of see you and ask your advic you have done wise said my friend but have you told me all yes all miss roylott you have not you are screen your stepfath whi what do you mean for answer holm push back the frill of black lace which fring the hand that lay upon our visitor knee five littl livid spot the mark of four finger and a thumb were print upon the white wrist you have been cruelli use said holm the ladi colour deepli and cover over her injur wrist he is a hard man she said and perhap he hard know his own strength there was a long silenc dure which holm lean his chin upon his hand and stare into the crackl fire this is a veri deep busi he said at last there are a thousand detail which i should desir to know befor i decid upon our cours of action yet we have not a moment to lose if we were to come to stoke moran to day would it be possibl for us to see over these room without the knowledg of your stepfath as it happen he spoke of come into town to day upon some most import busi it is probabl that he will be away all day and that there would be noth to disturb you we have a housekeep now but she is old and foolish and i could easili get her out of the way excel you are not avers to this trip watson by no mean then we shall both come what are you go to do yourself i have one or two thing which i would wish to do now that i am in town but i shall return by the twelv oclock train so as to be there in time for your come and you may expect us earli in the afternoon i have

afternoon she drop her thick black veil over her face and glide from the room and what do you think of it all watson ask sherlock holm lean back in his chair it seem to me to be a most dark and sinist busi dark enough and sinist enough yet if the ladi is correct in say that the floor and wall are sound and that the door window and chimney are impass then her sister must have been undoubt alon when she met her mysteri end what becom then of these nocturn whistl and what of the veri peculiar word of the die woman i cannot think when you combin the idea of whistl at night the presenc of a band of gipsi who are on intim term with this old doctor the fact that we have everi reason to believ that the doctor has an interest in prevent his stepdaught marriag the die allus to a band and final the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metal clang which might have been caus by one of those metal bar that secur the shutter fall back into it place i think that there is good ground to think that the mysteri may be clear along those line but what then did the gipsi do i cannot imagin i see mani object to ani such theori and so do i it is precis for that reason that we are go to stoke moran this day i want to see whether the object are fatal or if they may be explain away but what in the name of the devil the ejacul had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been sudden dash open and that a huge man had frame himself in the apertur his costum was a peculiar mixtur of the profession and of the agricultur have a black top hat a long frock coat and a pair of high gaiter with a hunt crop swing in his hand so tall was he that his hat actual brush the cross bar of the doorway and his breadth seem to span it across from side to side a larg face sear with a thousand

through the love surrey lane it was a perfect day with a bright sun and a few fleeci cloud in the heaven the tree and waysid hedg were just throw out their first green shoot and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth to me at least there was a strang contrast between the sweet promis of the spring and this sinist quest upon which we were engag my companion sat in the front of the trap his arm fold his hat pull down over his eye and his chin sunk upon his breast buri in the deepest thought sudden howev he start tap me on the shoulder and point over the meadow look there said he a heavili timber park stretch up in a gentl slope thicken into a grove at the highest point from amid the branch there jut out the grey gabl and high roof tree of a veri old mansion stoke

fanci is miss stoner observ holm shade his eye yes i think we had better do as you suggest we got off paid our fare and the trap rattl back on it way to leatherhead i thought it as well said holm as we climb the stile that this fellow should think we had come here as architect or on some definit busi it may stop his gossip good afternoon miss stoner you see that we have been as good as our word

she listen good heaven she cri he has follow me then so it appear he is so cun that i never know when i am safe from him what will he say when he return he must guard himself for he may find that there is someon more cun than himself upon his track you must lock yourself up from him to night if he is violent we shall take you away to your aunt at harrow now we must make the best use of our time so kind take us at onc to the room which we are to examin the build was of grey lichen blotch stone with a high central portion and two curv wing like the claw of a crab thrown out on each side in one of these wing the window were broken and block with wooden board while the roof was part cave in a pictur of ruin the central portion was in littl better repair but the right hand block was compar modern and the blind in the window with the blue smoke curl up from the chimney show that this was where the famili resid some scaffold had been erect against the end wall and the stone work had been broken into but there were no sign of ani workmen at the moment of our visit holm walk slowli up and down the ill trim lawn and examin with deep attent the outsid of the window this i take it belong to the room in which you use to sleep the centr one to your sister and the one next to the main build to dr roylott chamber exact so but i am now sleep in the middl one pend the alter as i understand by the way there doe not seem to be ani veri press need for repair at that end wall there were none i believ that it was an excus to move me from my room ah that is suggest now on the other side of this narrow wing run the corridor from which these three room open there are window in it of cours yes but veri small one too narrow for anyon to pass through as you both lock your door at night your room were unapproach from that side now would you have the kind to go into your room and bar your shutter miss stoner did so and holm after a care examin through the open window endeavour in everi way to forc the shutter open but without success there was no slit through which a knife could be pass to rais the bar then with his len he test the hing but they were of solid iron built firm into the massiv masonri hum said he scratch his chin in some perplex my theori certain present some difficulti no one could pass these shutter if they were bolt well we shall see if the insid throw ani light upon the matter a small side door led into the whitewash corridor from which the three bedroom open holm refus to examin the third chamber so we pass at onc to the second that in which miss stoner was now sleep and in which her sister had met with her fate it was a home littl room with a low ceil and a gape fireplac after the fashion of old countri hous a brown chest of drawer stood in one corner a narrow white counterpan bed in anoth and a dress tabl on the left hand side of the window these articl with two small wicker work chair made up all the furnitur in the room save for a squar of wilton carpet in the centr the board round and the panel of the wall were of brown worm eaten oak so old and discolour that it may have date from the origin build of the hous holm drew one of the chair into a corner and sat silent while his eye travel round and round and up and down take in everi detail of the apart where doe that bell communic with he ask at last point to a thick bell rope which hung down besid the bed the tassel actual lie upon the pillow it goe to the housekeep room it look newer than the other thing yes it was onli put there a coupl of year ago your sister ask for it i suppos no i never heard of her use it we use alway to get what we want for ourselv inde it seem unnecessari to put so nice a bell pull there you will excus me for a few minut while i satisfi myself as to this floor he threw himself down upon his face with his len in his hand and crawl swift backward and forward examin minut the crack between the board then he did the same with the wood work with which the chamber was panel final he walk over to the bed and spent some time in stare at it and in run his eye up and down the wall final he took the bell rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug whi it a dummi said he wont it ring no it is not even attach to a wire this is veri interest you can see now that it is fasten to a hook just abov where the littl open for the ventil is how veri absurd i never notic that befor veri strang mutter holm pull at the rope there are one or two veri singular point about this room for exampl what a fool a builder must be to open a ventil into anoth room when with the same troubl he might have communic with the outsid air that is also quit modern said the ladi done about the same time as the bell rope remark holm yes there were sever littl chang carri out about that time they seem to have been of a most interest characterdummi bell rope and ventil which do not ventil with your permiss miss stoner we shall now carri our research into the inner apart dr grimesbi roylott chamber was larger than that of his step daughter but was as plain furnish a camp bed a small wooden shelf full of book most of a technic charact an armchair besid the bed a plain wooden chair against the wall a round tabl and a larg iron safe were the princip thing which met the eye holm walk slowli round and examin each and all of them with the keenest interest what in here he ask tap the safe my stepfath busi paper oh you have seen insid then onli onc some year ago i rememb that it was full of paper there isnt a cat in it for exampl no what a strang idea well look at this he took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it no we dont keep a cat but there is a cheetah and a baboon ah yes of cours well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk doe not go veri far in satisfi it want i daresay there is one point which i should wish to determin he squat down in front of the wooden chair and examin the seat of it with the greatest attent thank you that is quit settl said he rise and put his len in his pocket hullo here is someth interest the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed the lash howev was curl upon itself and tie so as to make a loop of whipcord what do you make of that watson it a common enough lash but i dont know whi it should be tie that is not quit so common is it ah me it a wick world and when a clever man turn his brain to crime it is the worst of all i think that i have seen enough now miss stoner and with your permiss we shall walk out upon the lawn i had never seen my friend face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turn from the scene of this investig we had walk sever time up and down the lawn neither miss stoner nor myself like to break in upon his thought befor he rous himself from his reveri it is veri essenti miss stoner said he that you should absolut follow my advic in everi respect i shall most certain do so the matter is too serious for ani hesit your life may depend upon your complianc i assur you that i am in your hand in the first place both my friend and i must spend the night in your room both miss stoner and i gaze at him in astonish yes it must be so let me explain i believ that that is the villag inn over there yes that is the crown veri good your window would be visibl from there certain you must confin yourself to your room on pretenc of a headach when your stepfath come back then when you hear him retir for the night you must open the shutter of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then withdraw quiet with everyth which you are like to want into the room which you use to occupi i have no doubt that in spite of the repair you could manag there for one night oh yes easili the rest you will leav in our hand but what will you do we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investig the caus of this nois which has disturb you i believ mr holm that you have alreadi made up your mind said miss stoner lay her hand upon my companion sleev perhap i have then for piti sake tell me what was the caus of my sister death i should prefer to have clearer proof befor i speak you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and if she die from some sudden fright no i do not think so i think that there was probabl some more tangibl caus and now miss stoner we must leav you for if dr roylott return and saw us our journey would be in vain good bye and be brave for if you will do what i have told you you may rest assur that we shall soon drive away the danger that threaten you sherlock holm and i had no difficulti in engag a bedroom and sit room at the crown inn they were on the upper floor and from our window we could command a view of the avenu gate and of the inhabit wing of stoke moran manor hous at dusk we saw dr grimesbi roylott drive past his huge form loom up besid the littl figur of the lad who drove him the boy had some slight difficulti in undo the heavi iron gate and we heard the hoars roar of the doctor voic and saw the furi with which he shook his clinch fist at him the trap drove on and a few minut later we saw a sudden light spring up among the tree as the lamp was lit in one of the sit room do you know watson said holm as we sat togeth in the gather dark i have realli some scrupl as to take you to night there is a distinct element of danger can i be of assist your presenc might be invalu then i shall certain come it is veri kind of you you speak of danger you have evid seen more in these room than was visibl to me no but i fanci that i may have deduc a littl more i imagin that you saw all that i did i saw noth remark save the bell rope and what purpos that could answer i confess is more than i can imagin you saw the ventil too yes but i do not think that it is such a veri unusu thing to have a small open between two room it was so small that a rat could hard pass through i knew that we should find a ventil befor ever we came to stoke moran my dear holm oh yes i did you rememb in her statement she said that her sister could smell dr roylott cigar now of cours that suggest at onc that there must be a communic between the two room it could onli be a small one or it would have been remark upon at the coron inquiri i deduc a ventil but what harm can there be in that well there is at least a curious coincid of date a ventil is made a cord is hung and a ladi who sleep in the bed die doe not that strike you i cannot as yet see ani connect did you observ anyth veri peculiar about that bed no it was clamp to the floor did you ever see a bed fasten like that befor i cannot say that i have the ladi could not move her bed it must alway be in the same relat posit to the ventil and to the ropeor so we may call it sinc it was clear never meant for a bell pull holm i cri i seem to see dim what you are hint at we are onli just in time to prevent some subtl and horribl crime subtl enough and horribl enough when a doctor doe go wrong he is the first of crimin he has nerv and he has knowledg palmer and pritchard were among the head of their profess this man strike even deeper but i think watson that we shall be abl to strike deeper still but we shall have horror enough befor the night is over for good sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our mind for a few hour to someth more cheer about nine oclock the light among the tree was extinguish and all was dark in the direct of the manor hous two hour pass slowli away and then sudden just at the stroke of eleven a singl bright light shone out right in front of us that is our signal said holm spring to his feet it come from the middl window as we pass out he exchang a few word with the landlord explain that we were go on a late visit to an acquaint and that it was possibl that we might spend the night there a moment later we were out on the dark road a chill wind blow in our face and one yellow light twinkl in front of us through the gloom to guid us on our sombr errand there was littl difficulti in enter the ground for unrepair breach gape in the old park wall make our way among the tree we reach the lawn cross it and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bush there dart what seem to be a hideous and distort child who threw itself upon the grass with writh limb and then ran swift across the lawn into the dark my god i whisper did you see it holm was for the moment as startl as i his hand close like a vice upon my wrist in his agit then he broke into a low laugh and put his lip to my ear it is a nice household he murmur that is the baboon i had forgotten the strang pet which the doctor affect there was a cheetah too perhap we might find it upon our shoulder at ani moment i confess that i felt easier in my mind when after follow holm exampl and slip off my shoe i found myself insid the bedroom my companion noiseless close the shutter move the lamp onto the tabl and cast his eye round the room all was as we had seen it in the daytim then creep up to me and make a trumpet of his hand he whisper into my ear again so gentl that it was all that i could do to distinguish the word the least sound would be fatal to our plan i nod to show that i had heard we must sit without light he would see it through the ventil i nod again do not go asleep your veri life may depend upon it have your pistol readi in case we should need it i will sit on the side of the bed and you in that chair i took out my revolv and laid it on the corner of the tabl holm had brought up a long thin cane and this he place upon the bed besid him by it he laid the box of match and the stump of a candl then he turn down the lamp and we were left in dark how shall i ever forget that dread vigil i could not hear a sound not even the draw of a breath and yet i knew that my companion sat open eye within a few feet of me in the same state of nervous tension in which i was myself the shutter cut off the least ray of light and we wait in absolut dark from outsid came the occasion cri of a night bird and onc at our veri window a long drawn catlik whine which told us that the cheetah was inde at liberti far away we could hear the deep tone of the parish clock which boom out everi quarter of an hour how long they seem those quarter twelv struck and one and two and three and still we sat wait silent for whatev might befal sudden there was the momentari gleam of a light up in the direct of the ventil which vanish immedi but was succeed by a strong smell of burn oil and heat metal someon in the next room had lit a dark lantern i heard a gentl sound of movement and then all was silent onc more though the smell grew stronger for half an hour i sat with strain ear then sudden anoth sound becam audiblea veri gentl sooth sound like that of a small jet of steam escap continu from a kettl the instant that we heard it holm sprang from the bed struck a match and lash furious with his cane at the bell pull you see it watson he yell you see it but i saw noth at the moment when holm struck the light i heard a low clear whistl but the sudden glare flash into my weari eye made it imposs for me to tell what it was at which my friend lash so savag i could howev see that his face was dead pale and fill with horror and loath he had ceas to strike and was gaze up at the ventil when sudden there broke from the silenc of the night the most horribl cri to which i have ever listen it swell up louder and louder a hoars yell of pain and fear and anger all mingl in the one dread shriek they say that away down in the villag and even in the distant parsonag that cri rais the sleeper from their bed it struck cold to our heart and i stood gaze at holm and he at me until the last echo of it had die away into the silenc from which it rose what can it mean i gasp it mean that it is all over holm answer and perhap after all it is for the best take your pistol and we will enter dr roylott room with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor twice he struck at the chamber door without ani repli from within then he turn the handl and enter i at his heel with the cock pistol in my hand it was a singular sight which met our eye on the tabl stood a dark lantern with the shutter half open throw a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar besid this tabl on the wooden chair sat dr grimesbi roylott clad in a long grey dress gown his bare ankl protrud beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slipper across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had notic dure the day his chin was cock upward and his eye were fix in a dread rigid stare at the corner of the ceil round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with brownish speckl which seem to be bound tight round his head as we enter he made neither sound nor motion the band the speckl band whisper holm i took a step forward in an instant his strang headgear began to move and there rear itself from among his hair the squat diamond shape head and puf neck of a loathsom serpent it is a swamp adder cri holm the deadliest snake in india he has die within ten second of be bitten violenc doe in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer fall into the pit which he dig for anoth let us thrust this creatur back into it den and we can then remov miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the counti polic know what has happen as he spoke he drew the dog whip swift from the dead man lap and throw the noos round the reptil neck he drew it from it horrid perch and carri it at arm length threw it into the iron safe which he close upon it such are the true fact of the death of dr grimesbi roylott of stoke moran it is not necessari that i should prolong a narrat which has alreadi run to too great a length by tell how we broke the sad news to the terrifi girl how we convey her by the morn train to the care of her good aunt at harrow of how the slow process of offici inquiri came to the conclus that the doctor met his fate while indiscreet play with a danger pet the littl which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holm as we travel back next day i had said he come to an entir erron conclus which show my dear watson how danger it alway is to reason from insuffici data the presenc of the gipsi and the use of the word band which was use by the poor girl no doubt to explain the appear which she had caught a hurri glimps of by the light of her match were suffici to put me upon an entir wrong scent i can onli claim the merit that i instant reconsid my posit when howev it becam clear to me that whatev danger threaten an occup of the room could not come either from the window or the door my attent was speedili drawn as i have alreadi remark to you to this ventil and to the bell rope which hung down to the bed the discoveri that this was a dummi and that the bed was clamp to the floor instant gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridg for someth pass through the hole and come to the bed the idea of a snake instant occur to me and when i coupl it with my knowledg that the doctor was furnish with a suppli of creatur from india i felt that i was probabl on the right track the idea of use a form of poison which could not possibl be discov by ani chemic test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern train the rapid with which such a poison would take effect would also from his point of view be an advantag it would be a sharp eye coron inde who could distinguish the two littl dark punctur which would show where the poison fang had done their work then i thought of the whistl of cours he must recal the snake befor the morn light reveal it to the victim he had train it probabl by the use of the milk which we saw to return to him when summon he would put it through this ventil at the hour that he thought best with the certainti that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed it might or might not bite the occup perhap she might escap everi night for a week but sooner or later she must fall a victim i had come to these conclus befor ever i had enter his room an inspect of his chair show me that he had been in the habit of stand on it which of cours would be necessari in order that he should reach the ventil the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to final dispel ani doubt which may have remain the metal clang heard by miss stoner was obvious caus by her stepfath hastili close the door of his safe upon it terribl occup have onc made up my mind you know the step which i took in order to put the matter to the proof i heard the creatur hiss as i have no doubt that you did also and i instant lit the light and attack it with the result of drive it through the ventil and also with the result of caus it to turn upon it master at the other side some of the blow of my cane came home and rous it snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person it saw in this way i am no doubt indirect respons for dr grimesbi roylott death and i cannot say that it is like to weigh veri heavili upon my conscienc ix the adventur of the engin thumb of all the problem which have been submit to my friend mr sherlock holm for solut dure the year of our intimaci there were onli two which i was the mean of introduc to his noticethat of mr hatherley thumb and that of colonel warburton mad of these the latter may have afford a finer field for an acut and origin observ but the other was so strang in it incept and so dramat in it detail that it may be the more worthi of be place upon record even if it gave my friend fewer open for those deduct method of reason by which he achiev such remark result the stori has i believ been told more than onc in the newspap but like all such narrat it effect is much less strike when set forth en bloc in a singl half column of print than when the fact slowli evolv befor your own eye and the mysteri clear gradual away as each new discoveri furnish a step which lead on to the complet truth at the time the circumst made a deep impress upon me and the laps of two year has hard serv to weaken the effect it was in the summer of 89 not long after my marriag that the event occur which i am now about to summaris i had return to civil practic and had final abandon holm in his baker street room although i continu visit him and occasion even persuad him to forgo his bohemian habit so far as to come and

there was a gentleman wait who wish to see me upon busi he brought up a card too with the name of colonel lysand stark engrav upon it close at his heel came the colonel himself a man rather over the middl size but of an exceed thin i do not think that i have ever seen so thin a man his whole face sharpen away into nose and chin and the skin of his cheek was drawn quit tens over his outstand bone yet this emaci seem to be his natur habit and due to no diseas for his eye was bright his step brisk and his bear assur he was plain but neat dress and his age i should judg would be nearer forti than thirti mr hatherley said he with someth of a german accent you have been recommend to me mr hatherley as be a man who is not onli profici in his profess but is also discreet and capabl of preserv a

across the room he flung open the door the passag outsid was empti that all right said he come back i know that clerk are sometim curious as to their master affair now we can talk in safeti he drew up his chair veri close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same question and thought look a feel of repuls and of someth akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strang antic of this fleshless man even my dread of lose a client could not restrain me from show my impati i beg that you will state your busi sir said i my time is of valu heaven forgiv me for that last sentenc but the word came to my lip how would fifti guinea for a night work suit you he ask most admir i say a night work but an hour would be nearer the mark i simpli want your opinion about a hydraul stamp machin which has got out of gear if you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselv what do you think of such a commiss as that the work appear to be light and the pay munific precis so we shall want you to come to night by the last train where to to eyford in berkshir it is a littl place near the border of oxfordshir and within seven mile of read there is a train from paddington which would bring you there at about 1115 veri good i shall come down in a carriag to meet you there is a drive then yes our littl place is quit out in the countri it is a good seven mile from eyford station then we can hard get there befor midnight i suppos there would be no chanc of a train back i should be compel to stop the night yes we could easili give you a shake down that is veri awkward could i not come at some more conveni hour we have judg it best that you should come late it is to recompens you for ani inconveni that we are pay to you a young and unknown man a fee which would buy an opinion from the veri head of your profess still of cours if you would like to draw out of the busi there is plenti of time to do so i thought of the fifti guinea and of how veri use they would be to me not at all said i i shall be veri happi to accommod myself to your wish i should like howev to understand a littl more clear what it is that you wish me to do quit so it is veri natur that the pledg of secreci which we have exact from you should have arous your curios i have no wish to commit you to anyth without your have it all laid befor you i suppos that we are absolut safe from eavesdropp entir then the matter stand thus you are probabl awar that fuller earth is a valuabl product and that it is onli found in one or two place in england i have heard so some littl time ago i bought a small placea veri small placewithin ten mile of read i was fortun enough to discov that there was a deposit of fuller earth in one of my field on examin it howev i found that this deposit was a compar small one and that it form a link between two veri much larger one upon the right and leftboth of them howev in the ground of my neighbour these good peopl were absolut ignor that their land contain that which was quit as valuabl as a gold mine natur it was to my interest to buy their land befor they discov it true valu but unfortun i had no capit by which i could do this i took a few of my friend into the secret howev and they suggest that we should quiet and secret work our own littl deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enabl us to buy the neighbour field this we have now been do for some time and in order to help us in our oper we erect a hydraul press this press as i have alreadi explain has got out of order and we wish your advic upon the subject we guard our secret veri jealous howev and if it onc becam known that we had hydraul engin come to our littl hous it would soon rous inquiri and then if the fact came out it would be good bye to ani chanc of get these field and carri out our plan that is whi i have made you promis me that you will not tell a human be that you are go to eyford to night i hope that i make it all plain i quit follow you said i the onli point which i could not quit understand was what use you could make of a hydraul press in excav fuller earth which as i understand is dug out like gravel from a pit ah said he careless we have our own process we compress the earth into brick so as to remov them without reveal what they are but that is a mere detail i have taken you fulli into my confid now mr hatherley and i have shown you how i trust you he rose as he spoke i shall expect you then at eyford at 1115 i shall certain be there and not a word to a soul he look at me with a last long question gaze and then press my hand in a cold dank grasp he hurri from the room well when i came to think it all over in cool blood i was veri much astonish as you may both think at this sudden commiss which had been intrust to me on the one hand of cours i was glad for the fee was at least tenfold what i should have ask had i set a price upon my own servic and it was possibl that this order might lead to other one on the other hand the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleas impress upon me and i could not think that his explan of the fuller earth was suffici to explain the necess for my come at midnight and his extrem anxieti lest i should tell anyon of my errand howev i threw all fear to the wind ate a hearti supper drove to paddington and start off have obey to the letter the injunct as to hold my tongu at read i had to chang not onli my carriag but my station howev i was in time for the last train to eyford and i reach the littl dim lit station after eleven oclock i was the onli passeng who got out there and there was no one upon the platform save a singl sleepi porter with a lantern as i pass out through the wicket gate howev i found my acquaint of the morn wait in the shadow upon the other side without a word he grasp my arm and hurri me into a carriag the door of which was stand open he drew up the window on either side tap on the wood work and away we went as fast as the hors could go one hors interject holm yes onli one did you observ the colour yes i saw it by the side light when i was step into the carriag it was a chestnut tire look or fresh oh fresh and glossi thank you i am sorri to have interrupt you pray continu your most interest statement away we went then and we drove for at least an hour colonel lysand stark had said that it was onli seven mile but i should think from the rate that we seem to go and from the time that we took that it must have been nearer twelv he sat at my side in silenc all the time and i was awar more than onc when i glanc in his direct that he was look at me with great intens the countri road seem to be not veri good in that part of the world for we lurch and jolt terribl i tri to look out of the window to see someth of where we were but they were made of frost glass and i could make out noth save the occasion bright blur of a pass light now and then i hazard some remark to break the monotoni of the journey but the colonel answer onli in monosyl and the convers soon flag at last howev the bump of the road was exchang for the crisp smooth of a gravel drive and the carriag came to a stand colonel lysand stark sprang out and as i follow after him pull me swift into a porch which gape in front of us we step as it were right out of the carriag and into the hall so that i fail to catch the most fleet glanc of the front of the hous the instant that i had cross the threshold the door slam heavili behind us and i heard faint the rattl of the wheel as the carriag drove away it was pitch dark insid the hous and the colonel fumbl about look for match and mutter under his breath sudden a door open at the other end of the passag and a long golden bar of light shot out in our direct it grew broader and a woman appear with a lamp in her hand which she held abov her head push her face forward and peer at us i could see that she was pretti and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it was a rich materi she spoke a few word in a foreign tongu in a tone as though ask a question and when my companion answer in a gruff monosyl she gave such a start that the lamp near fell from her hand colonel stark went up to her whisper someth in her ear and then push her back into the room from whenc she had come he walk toward me again with the lamp in his hand perhap you will have the kind to wait in this room for a few minut said he throw open anoth door it was a quiet littl plain furnish room with a round tabl in the centr on which sever german book were scatter colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium besid the door i shall not keep you wait an instant said he and vanish into the dark i glanc at the book upon the tabl and in spite of my ignor of german i could see that two of them were treatis on scienc the other be volum of poetri then i walk across to the window hope that i might catch some glimps of the countri side but an oak shutter heavili bar was fold across it it was a wonder silent hous there was an old clock tick loud somewher in the passag but otherwis everyth was dead still a vagu feel of uneasi began to steal over me who were these german peopl and what were they do live in this strang out of the way place and where was the place i was ten mile or so from eyford that was all i knew but whether north south east or west i had no idea for that matter read and possibl other larg town were within that radius so the place might not be so seclud after all yet it was quit certain from the absolut still that we were in the countri i pace up and down the room hum a tune under my breath to keep up my spirit and feel that i was thorough earn my fifti guinea fee sudden without ani preliminari sound in the midst of the utter still the door of my room swung slowli open the woman was stand in the apertur the dark of the hall behind her the yellow light from my lamp beat upon her eager and beauti face i could see at a glanc that she was sick with fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart she held up one shake finger to warn me to be silent and she shot a few whisper word of broken english at me her eye glanc back like those of a frighten hors into the gloom behind her i would go said she tri hard as it seem to me to speak calm i would go i should not stay here there is no good for you to do but madam said i i have not yet done what i came for i cannot possibl leav until i have seen the machin it is not worth your while to wait she went on you can pass through the door no one hinder and then see that i smile and shook my head she sudden threw asid her constraint and made a step forward with her hand wrung togeth for the love of heaven she whisper get away from here befor it is too late but i am somewhat headstrong by natur and the more readi to engag in an affair when there is some obstacl in the way i thought of my fifti guinea fee of my wearisom journey and of the unpleas night which seem to be befor me was it all to go for noth whi should i slink away without have carri out my commiss and without the payment which was my due this woman might for all i knew be a monomaniac with a stout bear therefor though her manner had shaken me more than i care to confess i still shook my head and declar my intent of remain where i was she was about to renew her entreati when a door slam overhead and the sound of sever footstep was heard upon the stair she listen for an instant threw up her hand with a despair gestur and vanish as sudden and as noiseless as she had come the newcom were colonel lysand stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard grow out of the creas of his doubl chin who was introduc to me as mr ferguson this is my secretari and manag said the colonel by the way i was under the impress that i left this door shut just now i fear that you have felt the draught on the contrari said i i open the door myself becaus i felt the room to be a littl close he shot one of his suspici look at me perhap we had better proceed to busi then said he mr ferguson and i will take you up to see the machin i had better put my hat on i suppos oh no it is in the hous what you dig fuller earth in the hous no no this is onli where we compress it but never mind that all we wish you to do is to examin the machin and to let us know what is wrong with it we went upstair togeth the colonel first with the lamp the fat manag and i behind him it was a labyrinth of an old hous with corridor passag narrow wind staircas and littl low door the threshold of which were hollow out by the generat who had cross them there were no carpet and no sign of ani furnitur abov the ground floor while the plaster was peel off the wall and the damp was break through in green unhealthi blotch i tri to put on as unconcern an air as possibl but i had not forgotten the warn of the ladi even though i disregard them and i kept a keen eye upon my two companion ferguson appear to be a moros and silent man but i could see from the littl that he said that he was at least a fellow countryman colonel lysand stark stop at last befor a low door which he unlock within was a small squar room in which the three of us could hard get at one time ferguson remain outsid and the colonel usher me in we are now said he actual within the hydraul press and it would be a particular unpleas thing for us if anyon were to turn it on the ceil of this small chamber is realli the end of the descend piston and it come down with the forc of mani ton upon this metal floor there are small later column of water outsid which receiv the forc and which transmit and multipli it in the manner which is familiar to you the machin goe readili enough but there is some stiff in the work of it and it has lost a littl of it forc perhap you will have the good to look it over and to show us how we can set it right i took the lamp from him and i examin the machin veri thorough it was inde a gigant one and capabl of exercis enorm pressur when i pass outsid howev and press down the lever which control it i knew at onc by the whish sound that there was a slight leakag which allow a regurgit of water through one of the side cylind an examin show that one of the india rubber band which was round the head of a drive rod had shrunk so as not quit to fill the socket along which it work this was clear the caus of the loss of power and i point it out to my companion who follow my remark veri care and ask sever practic question as to how they should proceed to set it right when i had made it clear to them i return to the main chamber of the machin and took a good look at it to satisfi my own curios it was obvious at a glanc that the stori of the fuller earth was the merest fabric for it would be absurd to suppos that so power an engin could be design for so inadequ a purpos the wall were of wood but the floor consist of a larg iron trough and when i came to examin it i could see a crust of metal deposit all over it i had stoop and was scrape at this to see exact what it was when i heard a mutter exclam in german and saw the cadaver face of the colonel look down at me what are you do there he ask i felt angri at have been trick by so elabor a stori as that which he had told me i was admir your fuller earth said i i think that i should be better abl to advis you as to your machin if i knew what the exact purpos was for which it was use the instant that i utter the word i regret the rash of my speech his face set hard and a bale light sprang up in his grey eye veri well said he you shall know all about the machin he took a step backward slam the littl door and turn the key in the lock i rush toward it and pull at the handl but it was quit secur and did not give in the least to my kick and shove hullo i yell hullo colonel let me out and then sudden in the silenc i heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth it was the clank of the lever and the swish of the leak cylind he had set the engin at work the lamp still stood upon the floor where i had place it when examin the trough by it light i saw that the black ceil was come down upon me slowli jerkili but as none knew better than myself with a forc which must within a minut grind me to a shapeless pulp i threw myself scream against the door and drag with my nail at the lock i implor the colonel to let me out but the remorseless clank of the lever drown my cri the ceil was onli a foot or two abov my head and with my hand uprais i could feel it hard rough surfac then it flash through my mind that the pain of my death would depend veri much upon the posit in which i met it if i lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine and i shudder to think of that dread snap easier the other way perhap and yet had i the nerv to lie and look up at that dead black shadow waver down upon me alreadi i was unabl to stand erect when my eye caught someth which brought a gush of hope back to my heart i have said that though the floor and ceil were of iron the wall were of wood as i gave a last hurri glanc around i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the board which broaden and broaden as a small panel was push backward for an instant i could hard believ that here was inde a door which led away from death the next instant i threw myself through and lay half faint upon the other side the panel had close again behind me but the crash of the lamp and a few moment afterward the clang of the two slab of metal told me how narrow had been my escap i was recal to myself by a frantic pluck at my wrist and i found myself lie upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor while a woman bent over me and tug at me with her left hand while she held a candl in her right it was the same good friend whose warn i had so foolish reject come come she cri breathless they will be here in a moment they will see that you are not there oh do not wast the so precious time but come this time at least i did not scorn her advic i stagger to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a wind stair the latter led to anoth broad passag and just as we reach it we heard the sound of run feet and the shout of two voic one answer the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath my guid stop and look about her like one who is at her wit end then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom through the window of which the moon was shine bright it is your onli chanc said she it is high but it may be that you can jump it as she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passag and i saw the lean figur of colonel lysand stark rush forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher cleaver in the other i rush across the bedroom flung open the window and look out how quiet and sweet and wholesom the garden look in the moonlight and it could not be more than thirti feet down i clamber out upon the sill but i hesit to jump until i should have heard what pass between my saviour and the ruffian who pursu me if she were ill use then at ani risk i was determin to go back to her assist the thought had hard flash through my mind befor he was at the door push his way past her but she threw her arm round him and tri to hold him back fritz fritz she cri in english rememb your promis after the last time you said it should not be again he will be silent oh he will be silent you are mad elis he shout struggl to break away from her you will be the ruin of us he has seen too much let me pass i say he dash her to one side and rush to the window cut at me with his heavi weapon i had let myself go and was hang by the hand to the sill when his blow fell i was conscious of a dull pain my grip loosen and i fell into the garden below i was shaken but not hurt by the fall so i pick myself up and rush off among the bush as hard as i could run for i understood that i was far from be out of danger yet sudden howev as i ran a dead dizzi and sick came over me i glanc down at my hand which was throb pain and then for the first time saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pour from my wound i endeavour to tie my handkerchief round it but there came a sudden buzz in my ear and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rose bush how long i remain unconsci i cannot tell it must have been a veri long time for the moon had sunk and a bright morn was break when i came to myself my cloth were all sodden with dew and my coat sleev was drench with blood from my wound thumb the smart of it recal in an instant all the particular of my night adventur and i sprang to my feet with the feel that i might hard yet be safe from my pursuer but to my astonish when i came to look round me neither hous nor garden were to be seen i had been lie in an angl of the hedg close by the highroad and just a littl lower down was a long build which prove upon my approach it to be the veri station at which i had arriv upon the previous night were it not for the ugli wound upon my hand all that had pass dure those dread hour might have been an evil dream half daze i went into the station and ask about the morn train there would be one to read in less than an hour the same porter was on duti i found as had been there when i arriv i inquir of him whether he had ever heard of colonel lysand stark the name was strang to him had he observ a carriag the night befor wait for me no he had not was there a polic station anywher near there was one about three mile off it was too far for me to go weak and ill as i was i determin to wait until i got back to town befor tell my stori to the polic it was a littl past six when i arriv so i went first to have my wound dress and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here i put the case into your hand and shall do exact what you advis we both sat in silenc for some littl time after listen to this extraordinari narrat then sherlock holm pull down from the shelf one of the ponder commonplac book in which he place his cut here is an advertis which will interest you said he it appear in all the paper about a year ago listen to this lost on the 9th inst mr jeremiah hayl age twenti six a hydraul engin left his lodg at ten oclock at night and has not been heard of sinc was dress in etc etc ha that repres the last time that the colonel need to have his machin overhaul i fanci good heaven cri my patient then that explain what the girl said undoubt it is quit clear that the colonel was a cool and desper man who was absolut determin that noth should stand in the way of his littl game like those out and out pirat who will leav no survivor from a captur ship well everi moment now is precious so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to scotland yard at onc as a preliminari to start for eyford some three hour or so afterward we were all in the train togeth bound from read to the littl berkshir villag there were sherlock holm the hydraul engin inspector bradstreet of scotland yard a plain cloth man and myself bradstreet had spread an ordnanc map of the counti out upon the seat and was busi with his compass draw a circl with eyford for it centr there you are said he that circl is drawn at a radius of ten mile from the villag the place we want must be somewher near that line you said ten mile i think sir it was an hour good drive and you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconsci they must have done so i have a confus memori too of have been lift and convey somewher what i cannot understand said i is whi they should have spare you when they found you lie faint in the garden perhap the villain was soften by the woman entreati i hard think that like i never saw a more inexor face in my life oh we shall soon clear up all that said bradstreet well i have drawn my circl and i onli wish i knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found i think i could lay my finger on it said holm quiet realli now cri the inspector you have form your opinion come now we shall see who agre with you i say it is south for the countri is more desert there and i say east said my patient i am for west remark the plain cloth man there are sever quiet littl villag up there and i am for north said i becaus there are no hill there and our friend say that he did not notic the carriag go up ani come cri the inspector laugh it a veri pretti divers of opinion we have box the compass among us who do you give your cast vote to you are all wrong but we cant all be oh yes you can this is my point he place his finger in the centr of the circl this is where we shall find them but the twelv mile drive gasp hatherley six out and six back noth simpler you say yourself that the hors was fresh and glossi when you got in how could it be that if it had gone twelv mile over heavi road inde it is a like ruse enough observ bradstreet thought of cours there can be no doubt as to the natur of this gang none at all said holm they are coiner on a larg scale and have use the machin to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver we have known for some time that a clever gang was at work said the inspector they have been turn out half crown by the thousand we even trace them as far as read but could get no farther for they had cover their trace in a way that show that they were veri old hand but now thank to this lucki chanc i think that we have got them right enough but the inspector was mistaken for those crimin were not destin to fall into the hand of justic as we roll into eyford station we saw a gigant column of smoke which stream up from behind a small clump of tree in the neighbourhood and hung like an immens ostrich feather over the landscap a hous on fire ask bradstreet as the train steam off again on it way yes sir said the station master when did it break out i hear that it was dure the night sir but it has got wors and the whole place is in a blaze whose hous is it dr becher tell me broke in the engin is dr becher a german veri thin with a long sharp nose the station master laugh heartili no sir dr becher is an englishman and there isnt a man in the parish who has a better line waistcoat but he has a gentleman stay with him a patient as i understand who is a foreign and he look as if a littl good berkshir beef would do him no harm the station master had not finish his speech befor we were all hasten in the direct of the fire the road top a low hill and there was a great widespread whitewash build in front of us spout fire at everi chink and window while in the garden in front three fire engin were vain strive to keep the flame under that it cri hatherley in intens excit there is the gravel drive and there are the rose bush where i lay that second window is the one that i jump from well at least said holm you have had your reveng upon them there can be no question that it was your oil lamp which when it was crush in the press set fire to the wooden wall though no doubt they were too excit in the chase after you to observ it at the time now keep your eye open in this crowd for your friend of last night though i veri much fear that they are a good hundr mile off by now and holm fear came to be realis for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beauti woman the sinist german or the moros englishman earli that morn a peasant had met a cart contain sever peopl and some veri bulki box drive rapid in the direct of read but there all trace of the fugit disappear and even holm ingenu fail ever to discov the least clue as to their whereabout the firemen had been much perturb at the strang arrang which they had found within and still more so by discov a newli sever human thumb upon a window sill of the second floor about sunset howev their effort were at last success and they subdu the flame but not befor the roof had fallen in and the whole place been reduc to such absolut ruin that save some twist cylind and iron pipe not a trace remain of the machineri which had cost our unfortun acquaint so dear larg mass of nickel and of tin were discov store in an out hous but no coin were to be found which may have explain the presenc of those bulki box which have been alreadi refer to how our hydraul engin had been convey from the garden to the spot where he recov his sens might have remain forev a mysteri were it not for the soft mould which told us a veri plain tale he had evid been carri down by two person one of whom had remark small feet and the other unusu larg one on the whole it was most probabl that the silent englishman be less bold or less murder than his companion had assist the woman to bear the unconsci man out of the way of danger well said our engin ruefulli as we took our seat to return onc more to london it has been a pretti busi for me i have lost my thumb and i have lost a fifti guinea fee and what have i gain experi said holm laugh indirect it may be of valu you know you have onli to put it into word to gain the reput of be excel compani for the remaind of your exist x the adventur of the nobl bachelor the lord st simon marriag and it curious termin have long ceas to be a subject of interest in those exalt circl in which the unfortun bridegroom move fresh scandal have eclips it and their more piquant detail have drawn the gossip away from this four year old drama as i have reason to believ howev that the full fact have never been reveal to the general public and as my friend sherlock holm had a consider share in clear the matter up i feel that no memoir of him would be complet without some littl sketch of this remark episod it was a few week befor my own marriag dure the day when i was still share room with holm in baker street that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the tabl wait for him i had remain indoor all day for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain with high autumn wind and the jezail bullet which i had brought back in one of my limb as a relic of my afghan campaign throb with dull persist with my bodi in one easi chair and my leg upon anoth i had surround myself with a cloud of newspap until at last satur with the news of the day i toss them all asid and lay listless watch the huge crest and monogram upon the envelop upon the tabl and wonder lazili who my friend nobl correspond could be here is a veri fashion epistl i remark as he enter your morn letter if i rememb right were from a fish monger and a tide waiter yes my correspond has certain the charm of varieti he answer smile and the humbler are usual the more interest this look like one of those unwelcom social summons which call upon a man either to be bore or to lie he broke the seal and glanc

could see that i was amus her father is veri rich he is said to be the richest man on the pacif slope and how did he make his money in mine he had noth a few year ago then he struck gold invest it and came up by leap and bound now what is your own impress as to the young ladysyour wife charact the nobleman swung his glass a littl faster and stare down into the fire you see mr holm said he my wife was twenti befor her father becam a rich man dure that time she ran free in a mine camp and wander through wood or mountain so that her educ has come from natur rather than from the schoolmast she is what we call in england a tomboy with a strong natur wild and free unfett by ani sort of tradit she is impetuousvolcan i was about to say she is swift in make up her mind and fearless in carri out her resolut on the other hand i would not have given her the name which i have the honour to bearh gave a littl state coughhad not i thought her to be at bottom a nobl woman i believ that she is capabl of heroic self sacrific and that anyth dishonour would be repugn to her have you her photograph i brought this with me he open a locket and show us the full face of a veri love woman it was not a photograph but an ivori miniatur and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair the larg dark eye and the exquisit mouth holm gaze long and earnest at it then he close the

her and have now marri her she brought i understand a consider dowri a fair dowri not more than is usual in my famili and this of cours remain to you sinc the marriag is a fait accompli i realli have made no inquiri on the subject veri natur not did you see miss doran on the day befor the wed yes was she in good spirit never better she kept talk of what we should do in our futur live inde that is veri interest and on the morn of the wed she was as bright as possibleat least until after the ceremoni and did you observ ani chang in her then well to tell the truth i saw then the first sign that i had ever seen that her temper was just a littl sharp the incid howev was too trivial to relat and can have no possibl bear upon the case pray let us have it for all that oh it is childish she drop her bouquet as we went toward the vestri she was pass the front pew at the time and it fell over into the pew there was a moment delay but the gentleman in the pew hand it up to her again and it did not appear to be the wors for the fall yet when i spoke to her of the matter she answer me abrupt and in the carriag on our way home she seem absurd agit over this trifl caus inde you say that there was a gentleman in the pew some of the general public were present then oh yes it is imposs to exclud them when the church is open this gentleman was not one of your wife friend no no i call him a gentleman by courtesi but he was quit a common look person i hard notic his appear but realli i think that we are wander rather far from the point ladi st simon then return from the wed in a less cheer frame of mind than she had gone to it what did she do on re enter her father hous i saw her in convers with her maid and who is her maid alic is her name she is an american and came from california with her a confidenti servant a littl too much so it seem to me that her mistress allow her to take great liberti still of cours in america they look upon these thing in a differ way how long did she speak to this alic oh a few minut i had someth els to think of you did not overhear what they said ladi st simon said someth about jump a claim she was accustom to use slang of the kind i have no idea what she meant american slang is veri express sometim and what did your wife do when she finish speak to her maid she walk into the breakfast room on your arm no alon she was veri independ in littl matter like that then after we had sat down for ten minut or so she rose hurri mutter some word of apolog and left the room she never came back but this maid alic as i understand depos that she went to her room cover her bride dress with a long ulster put on a bonnet and went out quit so and she was afterward seen walk into hyde park in compani with flora millar a woman who is now in custodi and who had alreadi made a disturb at mr doran hous that morn ah yes i should like a few particular as to this young ladi and your relat to her lord st simon shrug his shoulder and rais his eyebrow we have been on a friend foot for some yearsi may say on a veri friend foot she use to be at the allegro i have not treat her ungener and she had no just caus of complaint against me but you know what women are mr holm flora was a dear littl thing but exceed hot head and devot attach to me she wrote me dread letter when she heard that i was about to be marri and to tell the truth the reason whi i had the marriag celebr so quiet was that i fear lest there might be a scandal in the church she came to mr doran door just after we return and she endeavour to push her way in utter veri abus express toward my wife and even threaten her but i had foreseen the possibl of someth of the sort and i had two polic fellow there in privat cloth who soon push her out again she was quiet when she saw that there was no good in make a row did your wife hear all this no thank good she did not and she was seen walk with this veri woman afterward yes that is what mr lestrad of scotland yard look upon as so serious it is thought that flora decoy my wife out and laid some terribl trap for her well it is a possibl supposit you think so too i did not say a probabl one but you do not yourself look upon this as like i do not think flora would hurt a fli still jealousi is a strang transform of charact pray what is your own theori as to what took place well realli i came to seek a theori not to propound one i have given you all the fact sinc you ask me howev i may say that it has occur to me as possibl that the excit of this affair the conscious that she had made so immens a social stride had the effect of caus some littl nervous disturb in my wife in short that she had becom sudden derang well realli when i consid that she has turn her backi will not say upon me but upon so much that mani have aspir

simon of cours id have done my duti by him we cant command our love but we can our action i went to the altar with him with the intent to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be but you may imagin what i felt when just as i came to the altar rail i glanc back and saw frank stand and look at me out of the first pew i thought it was his ghost at first but when i look again there he was still with a kind of question in his eye as if to ask me whether i were glad or sorri to see him i wonder i didnt drop i know that everyth was turn round and the word of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear i didnt know what to do should i stop the servic and make a scene in the church i glanc at him again and he seem to know what i was think for he rais his finger to his lip

ought to have spoken to lord st simon but it was dread hard befor his mother and all those great peopl i just made up my mind to run away and explain afterward i hadnt been at the tabl ten minut befor i saw frank out of the window at the other side of the road he beckon to me and then began walk into the park i slip out put on my thing and follow him some woman came talk someth or other about lord

a line to pa perhap to show him that i was aliv it was aw to me to think of all those lord and ladi sit round that breakfast tabl and wait for me to come back so frank took my wed cloth and thing and

sight seem to be almost inexplic noth could be more natur than the sequenc of event as narrat by this ladi and noth stranger than the result when view for instanc by mr lestrad of scotland yard you were not yourself at fault at all then from the first two fact were veri obvious to me the one that the ladi had been quit will to undergo the wed ceremoni the other that she had repent of it within a few minut of return home obvious someth had occur dure the morn then to caus her to chang her mind what could that someth be she could not have spoken to anyon when she was out for she had been in the compani of the bridegroom had she seen someon then if she had it must be someon from america becaus she had spent so short a time in this countri that she could hard have allow anyon to acquir so deep an influenc over her that the mere sight of him would induc her to chang her plan so complet you see we have alreadi arriv by a process of exclus at the idea that she might have seen an american then who could this american be and whi should he possess so much influenc over her it might be a lover it might be a husband her young womanhood had i knew been spent in rough scene and under strang condit so far i had got befor i ever heard lord st simon narrat when he told us of a man in a pew of the chang in the bride manner of so transpar a devic for obtain a note as the drop of a bouquet of her resort to her confidenti maid and of her veri signific allus to claim jumpingwhich in miner parlanc mean take possess of that which anoth person has a prior claim toth whole situat becam absolut

friend lestrad held inform in his hand the valu of which he did not himself know the initi were of cours of the highest import but more valuabl still was it to know that within a week he had settl his bill at one of the most select london hotel how did you deduc the select by the select price eight shill for a bed and eightpenc for a glass of sherri point to one of the most expens hotel there are

public and to lord st simon in particular i invit them to meet him here and as you see i made him keep the appoint but with no veri good result i remark his conduct was certain not veri gracious ah watson said holm smile perhap you would not be veri gracious either if after all the troubl of woo and wed you found yourself depriv in an instant of wife and of fortun i think that we may judg lord

much depend upon our be abl to find remun invest for our fund as upon our increas our connect and the number of our depositor one of our most lucrat mean of lay out money is in the shape of loan where the secur is unimpeach we have done a good deal in this direct dure the last few year and there are mani nobl famili to whom we have advanc larg sum upon the secur of their pictur librari or plate yesterday morn i was seat in my offic at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerk i start when i saw the name for it was that of none other thanwel perhap even to you i had better

should be happi to advanc it without further parley from my own privat purs said i were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear if on the other hand i am to do it in the name of the firm then in justic to my partner i must insist that even in your case everi businesslik precaut should be taken i should much prefer to have it so said he rais up a squar black morocco case which

lock it up in my privat safe and turn onc more to my work when even came i felt that it would be an imprud to leav so precious a thing in the offic behind me banker safe had been forc befor now and whi should not mine be if so how terribl would be the posit in which i should find myself i determin therefor that for the next few day i would alway carri the case backward and forward with me so that it might never be realli out of my reach with this intent i call a cab and drove out to my hous at streatham carri the jewel with me i did not breath freeli until i had taken it upstair and lock it in the bureau of my dress room and now a word as to my household mr holm for i wish you to thorough understand the situat my groom and my page sleep out of the hous and may be set asid altogeth i have three maid servant who have been with me a number of year and whose absolut reliabl is quit abov suspicion anoth luci parr the second wait maid has onli been in my servic a few month she came with an excel charact howev and has alway given me satisfact she is a veri pretti girl and has attract admir who have occasion hung about the place that is the onli drawback which we have found to her but we believ her to be a thorough good girl in everi way so much for the servant my famili itself is so small that it will not take me long to describ it i am a widow and have an onli son arthur he has been a disappoint to me mr holmesa grievous disappoint i have no doubt that i am myself to blame peopl tell me that i have spoil him veri like i have when my dear wife die i felt that he was all i had to love i could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face i have never deni him a wish perhap it would have been better for both of us had i been sterner but i meant it for the best it was natur my intent that he should succeed me in my busi but he was not of a busi turn he was wild wayward and to speak the truth i could not trust him in the handl of larg sum of money when he was young he becam a member of an aristocrat club and there have charm manner he was soon the intim of a number of men with long purs and expens habit he learn to play heavili at card and to squander money on the turf until he had again and again to come to me and implor me to give him an advanc upon his allow that he might settl his debt of honour he tri more than onc to break away from the danger compani which he was keep but each time the influenc of his friend sir georg burnwel was enough to draw him back again and inde i could not wonder that such a man as sir georg burnwel should gain an influenc over him for he has frequent brought him to my hous and i have found myself that i could hard resist the fascin of his manner he is older than arthur a man of the world to his finger tip one who had been everywher seen everyth a brilliant talker and a man of great person beauti yet when i think of him in cold blood far away from the glamour of his presenc i am convinc from his cynic speech and the look which i have caught in his eye that he is one who should be deepli distrust so i think and so too think my littl mari who has a woman quick insight into charact and now there is onli she to be describ she is my niec but when my brother die five year ago and left her alon in the world i adopt her and have look upon her ever sinc as my daughter she is a sunbeam in my

senseless on the ground i sent the hous maid for the polic and put the investig into their hand at onc when the inspector and a constabl enter the hous arthur who had stood sullen with his arm fold

was he do there at all if his purpos were innoc whi did he not say so precis and if it were guilti whi did he not invent a lie his silenc appear to me to cut both way there are sever singular point about the case what did the polic think of the nois which awok you from your sleep they consid that it might be caus by arthur close his bedroom door a like stori as if a man bent on feloni would slam his door so as to wake a household what did they say then of the disappear of these gem they are still sound the plank and probe the furnitur in the hope of find them have they thought of look outsid

were deepli stir by the stori to which we had listen i confess that the guilt of the banker son appear to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappi father but still i had such faith in holm judgment that i felt that there must be some ground for hope as long as he was dissatisfi with the accept explan he hard spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eye sunk in the deepest thought our client appear to have taken fresh heart at the littl glimps of hope which had been present to him and he even broke into a desultori chat with me over his busi affair a short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to fairbank the modest resid of the great financi fairbank was a good size squar hous of white stone

the banker with an ashen face i will tell you then what occur in your hous last night your niec when you had as she thought gone to your room slip down and talk to her lover through the window which lead into the stabl lane his footmark had press right through the snow so long had he stood there she told him of the coronet his wick lust for gold kindl at the news and he bent her to his will i have no doubt that she love you but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguish all other love and i think that she must have been one she had hard listen to his instruct when she saw you come downstair on which she close the window rapid and told you about one of the servant escapad with her wooden leg lover which was all perfect true your boy arthur went to bed after his interview with you but he slept bad on account of his uneasi about his club debt in the middl of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door so he rose and look out was surpris to see his cousin walk veri stealthili along the passag until she disappear into your dress room petrifi with astonish the lad slip on some cloth and wait there in the dark to see what would come of this strang affair present she emerg from the room again and in the light of the passag lamp your son saw that she carri the precious coronet in her hand she pass down the stair and he thrill with horror ran along and slip behind the curtain near your door whenc he could see what pass in the hall beneath he saw her stealthili open the window hand out the coronet to someon in the gloom and then close it onc more hurri back to her room pass quit close to where he stood hid behind the curtain as long as she was on the scene he could not take ani action without a horribl exposur of the woman whom he love but the instant that she was gone he realis how crush a misfortun this would be for you and how all import it was to set it right he rush down just as he was in his bare feet open the window sprang out into the snow and ran down the lane where he could see a dark figur in the moonlight sir georg burnwel tri to get away but arthur caught him and there was a struggl between them your lad tug at one side of the coronet and his oppon at the other in the scuffl your son struck sir georg and cut him over the eye then someth sudden snap and your son find that he had the coronet in his hand rush back close the window ascend to your room and had just observ that the coronet had been twist in the struggl and was endeavour to straighten it when you appear upon the scene is it possibl gasp the banker you then rous his anger by call him name at a moment when he felt that he had deserv your warmest thank he could not explain the true state of affair without betray one who certain deserv littl enough consider at his hand he took the more chivalr view howev and preserv her secret and that was whi she shriek and faint when she saw the coronet cri mr holder oh my god what a blind fool i have been and his ask to be allow to go out for five minut the dear fellow want to see if the miss piec were at the scene of the struggl how cruelli i have misjudg him when i arriv at the hous continu holm i at onc went veri care round it to observ if there were ani trace in the snow which might help me i knew that none had fallen sinc the even befor and also that there had been a strong frost to preserv impress i pass along the tradesmen path but found it all trampl down and indistinguish just beyond it howev at the far side of the kitchen door a woman had stood and talk with a man whose round impress on one side show that he had a wooden leg i could even tell that they had been disturb for the woman had run back swift to the door as was shown by the deep toe and light heel mark while wooden leg had wait a littl and then had gone away i thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart of whom you had alreadi spoken to me and inquiri show it was so i pass round the garden without see anyth more than random track which i took to be the polic but when i got into the stabl lane a veri long and complex stori was written in the snow in front of me there was a doubl line of track of a boot man and a second doubl line which i saw with delight belong to a man with nake feet i was at onc convinc from what you had told me that the latter was your son the first had walk both way but the other had run swift and as his tread was mark in place over the depress of the boot it was obvious that he had pass after the other i follow them up and found they led to the hall window where boot had worn all the snow away while wait then i walk to the other end which was a hundr yard or more down the lane i saw where boot had face round where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggl and final where a few drop of blood had fallen to show me that i was not mistaken boot had then run down the lane and anoth littl smudg of blood show that it was he who had been hurt when he came to the highroad at the other end i found that the pavement had been clear so there was an end to that clue on enter the hous howev i examin as you rememb the sill and framework of the hall window with my len and i could at onc see that someon had pass out i could distinguish the outlin of an instep where the wet foot had been place in come in i was then begin to be abl to form an opinion as to what had occur a man had wait outsid the window someon had brought the gem the deed had been overseen by your son he had pursu the thief had struggl with him they had each tug at the coronet their unit strength caus injuri which neither alon could have effect he had return with the prize but had left a fragment in the grasp of his oppon so far i was clear the question now was who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet it is an old maxim of mine that when you have exclud the imposs whatev remain howev improb must be the truth now i knew that it was not you who had brought it down so there onli remain your niec and the maid but if it were the maid whi should your son allow himself to be accus in their place there could be no possibl reason as he love his cousin howev there was an excel explan whi he should retain her secretth more so as the secret was a disgrac one when i rememb that you had seen her at that window and how she had faint on see the coronet again my conjectur becam a certainti and who could it be who was her confeder a lover evid for who els could outweigh the love and gratitud which she must feel to you i knew that you went out littl and that your circl of friend was a veri limit one but among them was sir georg burnwel i had heard of him befor as be a man of evil reput among women it must have been he who wore those boot and retain the miss gem even though he knew that arthur had discov him he might still flatter himself that he was safe for the lad could not say a word without compromis his own famili well your own good sens will suggest what measur i took next i went in the shape of a loafer to sir georg hous manag to pick up an acquaint with his valet learn that his master had cut his head the night befor and final at the expens of six shill made all sure by buy a pair of his cast off shoe with these i journey down to streatham and saw that they exact fit the track i saw an ill dress vagabond in the lane yesterday even said mr holder precis it was i i found that i had my man so i came home and chang my cloth it was a delic part which i had to play then for i saw that a prosecut must be avoid to avert scandal and i knew that so astut a villain would see that our hand were tie in the matter i went and saw him at first of cours he deni everyth but when i gave him everi particular that had occur he tri to bluster and took down a life preserv from the wall i knew my man howev and i clap a pistol to his head befor he could strike then he becam a littl more reason i told him that we would give him a price for the stone he held1000 pound apiec that brought out the first sign of grief that he had shown whi dash it all said he ive let them go at six hundr for the three i soon manag to get the address of the receiv who had them on promis him that there would be no prosecut off i set to him and after much chaffer i got our stone at 1000 pound apiec then i look in upon your son told him that all was right and eventu got to my bed about two oclock after what i may call a realli hard day work a day which has save england from a great public scandal said the banker rise sir i cannot find word to thank you

grasp this truth that in these littl record of our case which you have been good enough to draw up and i am bound to say occasion to embellish you have given promin not so much to the mani caus celebr and sensat trial in which i have figur but rather to those incid which may have been trivial in themselv but which have given room for those faculti of deduct and of logic synthesi which i have made my special provinc and yet said i smile i cannot quit hold myself absolv from the charg of sensate which has been urg against my record you have er perhap he observ take up a glow cinder with the tong and light with it the long cherri wood pipe which was wont to replac his clay when he was in a disputati rather than a medit moodyou have er perhap in attempt to put colour and life into each of your

full justic in the matter i remark with some cold for i was repel by the egot which i had more than onc observ to be a strong factor in my friend singular charact no it is not selfish or conceit said he answer as was his wont my thought rather than my word if i claim full justic for my art it is becaus it is an imperson thinga thing beyond myself crime is common logic is rare therefor it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell you have degrad what should have been a cours of lectur into a seri of tale it was a cold morn of the earli spring and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheeri fire in the old room at baker street a thick fog roll down between the line of dun colour hous and the oppos window loom like dark shapeless blur through the heavi yellow

of crime in it legal sens at all the small matter in which i endeavour to help the king of bohemia the singular experi of miss mari sutherland the problem connect with the man with the twist lip and the incid of the nobl bachelor were all matter which are outsid the pale of the law but in avoid the sensat i fear that you may have border on the trivial the end may have been so i answer but the method i hold to have been novel and of interest pshaw my dear fellow what do the public the great unobserv public who could hard tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb care about the finer shade of analysi and deduct but inde if you are trivial i cannot blame you for the day of the great case are past man or at least crimin man has lost all enterpris and origin as to my

matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum and that he humour her fanci in everi way in order to prevent an outbreak that is a possibl solutionin fact as matter stand it is the most probabl one but in ani case it doe not seem to be a nice household for a young ladi but the money mr holm the money well yes of cours the pay is goodtoo good that is what make me uneasi whi should they give you 120 pound a year when they could have their pick for 40 pound there must be some strong reason behind i thought that if i told you the circumst you would understand afterward if i want

need to be said holm grave i am much mistaken if we do not hear from her befor mani day are past it was not veri long befor my friend predict was fulfil a fortnight went by dure which i frequent found my thought turn in her direct and wonder what strang side alley of human experi this lone woman had stray into the unusu salari the curious condit the light duti all point to someth abnorm though whether a fad or a plot or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain it was quit beyond my power to determin as to holm i observ that he sat frequent for half an hour on end with knit brow and an abstract air but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when i mention it data data data he cri impati i cant make brick without clay and yet he would alway wind up by mutter that no sister of his should ever have accept such a situat the telegram which we eventu receiv came late one night just as i was think of turn in and holm was settl down to one of those all night chemic research which he frequent indulg in when i would leav him stoop over a retort and a test tube at night and find him in the same posit when i came down to breakfast in the morn he open the yellow envelop and then glanc at the messag threw it across to me just look up the train in bradshaw said he and turn back to his chemic studi the summon was a brief and urgent one pleas be at the black swan

set an edg to a man energi all over the countrysid away to the roll hill around aldershot the littl red and grey roof of the farm stead peep out from amid the light green of the new foliag are they not fresh and beauti i cri with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fog of baker street but holm shook his head grave do you know watson said he that it is one of the curs of a mind with a turn like mine that i must look at everyth with refer to my own special subject you look at these scatter hous and you are impress by their beauti i look at them and the onli thought which come to me is a feel of their isol and of the impun with which crime may be commit there good heaven i cri who would associ crime with these dear old homestead they alway fill me with a certain horror it is my belief watson found upon my experi that the lowest and vilest alley in london do not present a more dread record of sin than doe the smile and beauti countrysid you horrifi me but the reason is veri obvious the pressur of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish there is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortur child or the thud of a drunkard blow doe not beget sympathi and indign among the neighbour and then the whole machineri of justic is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it go and there is but a step between the crime and the dock but look at these lone hous each in it own field fill for the most part with poor ignor folk who know littl of the law think of the deed of hellish cruelti the hidden wicked which may go on year in year out in such place and none the wiser had this ladi who appeal to us for help gone to live in winchest i should never have had a fear for her it is the five mile of countri which make the danger still it is clear that she is not person threaten no if she can come to winchest to meet us she can get away quit so she has her freedom what can be the matter then can you suggest no explan i have devis seven separ explan each of which would cover the fact as far as we know them but which of these is correct can onli be determin by the fresh inform which we shall no doubt find wait for us well there is the tower of the cathedr and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has to tell the black swan is an inn of reput in the high street at no distanc from the station and there we found the young ladi wait for us she had engag a sit room and our lunch await us upon the tabl i am so delight that you have come she said earnest it is so veri kind of you both but inde i do not know what i should do your advic will be altogeth invalu to me pray tell us what has happen to you i will do so and i must be quick for i have promis mr rucastl to be back befor three i got his leav to come into town this morn though he littl knew for what purpos let us have everyth in it due order holm thrust his long thin leg out toward the fire and compos himself to listen in the first place i may say that i have met on the whole with no actual ill treatment from mr and mrs rucastl it is onli fair to them to say that but i cannot understand them and i am not easi in my mind about them what can you not understand their reason for their conduct but you shall have it all just as it occur when i came down mr rucastl met me here and drove me in his dog cart to the copper beech it is as he said beauti situat but it is not beauti in itself for it is a larg squar block of a hous whitewash but all stain and streak with damp and bad weather there are ground round it wood on three side and on the fourth a field which slope down to the southampton highroad which curv past about a hundr yard from the front door this ground in front belong to the hous but the wood all round are part of lord southerton preserv a clump of copper beech immedi in front of the hall door has given it name to the place i was driven over by my employ who was as amiabl as ever and was introduc by him that even to his wife and the child there was no truth mr holm in the conjectur which seem to us to be probabl in your room at baker street mrs rucastl is not mad i found her to be a silent pale face woman much younger than her husband not more than thirti i should think while he can hard be less than forti five from their convers i have gather that they have been marri about seven year that he was a widow and that his onli child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia mr rucastl told me in privat that the reason whi she had left them was that she had an unreason avers to her stepmoth as the daughter could not have been less than twenti i can quit imagin that her posit must have been uncomfort with her father young wife mrs rucastl seem to me to be colourless in mind as well as in featur she impress me neither favour nor the revers she was a nonent it was easi to see that she was passion devot both to her husband and to her littl son her light grey eye wander continu from one to the other note everi littl want and forestal it if possibl he was kind to her also in his bluff boister fashion and on the whole they seem to be a happi coupl and yet she had some secret sorrow this woman she would often be lost in deep thought with the saddest look upon her face more than onc i have surpris her in tear i have thought sometim that it was the disposit of her child which weigh upon her mind for i have never met so utter spoil and so ill natur a littl creatur he is small for his age with a head which is quit disproportion larg his whole life appear to be spent in an altern between savag fit of passion and gloomi interv of sulk give pain to ani creatur weaker than himself seem to be his one idea of amus and he show quit remark talent in plan the captur of mice littl bird and insect but i would rather not talk about the creatur mr holm and inde he has littl to do with my stori i am glad of all detail remark my friend whether they seem to you to be relev or not i shall tri not to miss anyth of import the one unpleas thing about the hous which struck me at onc was the appear and conduct of the servant there are onli two a man and his wife toller for that is his name is a rough uncouth man with grizzl hair and whisker and a perpetu smell of drink twice sinc i have been with them he has been quit drunk and yet mr rucastl seem to take no notic of it his wife is a veri tall and strong woman with a sour face as silent as mrs rucastl and much less amiabl they are a most unpleas coupl but fortun i spend most of my time in the nurseri and my own room which are next to each other in one corner of the build for two day after my arriv at the copper beech my life was veri quiet on the third mrs rucastl came down just after breakfast and whisper someth to her husband oh yes said he turn to me we are veri much oblig to you miss hunter for fall in with our whim so far as to cut your hair i assur you that it has not detract in the tiniest iota from your appear we shall now see how the electr blue dress will becom you you will find it laid out upon the bed in your room and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extrem oblig the dress which i found wait for me was of a peculiar shade of blue it was of excel materi a sort of beig but it bore unmistak sign of have been worn befor it could not have been a better fit if i had been measur for it both mr and mrs rucastl express a delight at the look of it which seem quit exagger in it vehem they were wait for me in the draw room which is a veri larg room stretch along the entir front of the hous with three long window reach down to the floor a chair had been place close to the central window with it back turn toward it in this i was ask to sit and then mr rucastl walk up and down on the other side of the room began to tell me a seri of the funniest stori that i have ever listen to you cannot imagin how comic he was and i laugh until i was quit weari mrs rucastl howev who has evid no sens of humour never so much as smile but sat with her hand in her lap and a sad anxious look upon her face after an hour or so mr rucastl sudden remark that it was time to commenc the duti of the day and that i might chang my dress and go to littl edward in the nurseri two day later this same perform was gone through under exact similar circumst again i chang my dress again i sat in the window and again i laugh veri heartili at the funni stori of which my employ had an immens repertoir and which he told inimit then he hand me a yellow back novel and move my chair a littl sideway that my own shadow might not fall upon the page he beg me to read aloud to him i read for about ten minut begin in the heart of a chapter and then sudden in the middl of a sentenc he order me to ceas and to chang my dress you can easili imagin mr holm how curious i becam as to what the mean of this extraordinari perform could possibl be they were alway veri care i observ to turn my face away from the window so that i becam consum with the desir to see what was go on behind my back at first it seem to be imposs but i soon devis a mean my hand mirror had been broken so a happi thought seiz me and i conceal a piec of the glass in my handkerchief on the next occas in the midst of my laughter i put my handkerchief up to my eye and was abl with a littl manag to see all that there was behind me i confess that i was disappoint there was noth at least that was my first impress at the second glanc howev i perceiv that there was a man stand in the southampton road a small beard man in a grey suit who seem to be look in my direct the road is an import highway and there are usual peopl there this man howev was lean against the rail which border our field and was look earnest up i lower my handkerchief and glanc at mrs rucastl to find her eye fix upon me with a most search gaze she said noth but i am convinc that she had divin that i had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me she rose at onc jephro said she there is an impertin fellow upon the road there who stare up at miss hunter no friend of your miss hunter he ask no i know no one in these part dear me how veri impertin kind turn round and motion to him to go away sure it would be better to take no notic no no we should have him loiter here alway kind turn round and wave him away like that i did as i was told and at the same instant mrs rucastl drew down the blind that was a week ago and from that time i have not sat again in the window nor have i worn the blue dress nor seen the man in the road pray continu said holm your narrat promis to be a most interest one you will find it rather disconnect i fear and there may prove to be littl relat between the differ incid of which i speak on the veri first day that i was at the copper beech mr rucastl took me to a small outhous which stand near the kitchen door as we approach it i heard the sharp rattl of a chain and the sound as of a larg anim move about look in here said mr rucastl show me a slit between two plank is he not a beauti i look through and was conscious of two glow eye and of a vagu figur huddl up in the dark dont be frighten said my employ laugh at the start which i had given it onli carlo my mastiff i call him mine but realli old toller my groom is the onli man who can do anyth with him we feed him onc a day and not too much then so that he is alway as keen as mustard toller let him loos everi night and god help the trespass whom he lay his fang upon for good sake dont you ever on ani pretext set your foot over the threshold at night for it as much as your life is worth the warn was no idl one for two night later i happen to look out of my bedroom window about two oclock in the morn it was a beauti moonlight night and the lawn in front of the hous was silver over and almost as bright as day i was stand rapt in the peac beauti of the scene when i was awar that someth was move under the shadow of the copper beech as it emerg into the moonshin i saw what it was it was a giant dog as larg as a calf tawni tint with hang jowl black muzzl and huge project bone it walk slowli across the lawn and vanish into the shadow upon the other side that dread sentinel sent a chill to my heart which i do not think that ani burglar could have done and now i have a veri strang experi to tell you i had as you know cut off my hair in london and i had place it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk one even after the child was in bed i began to amus myself by examin the furnitur of my room and by rearrang my own littl thing there was an old chest of drawer in the room the two upper one empti and open the lower one lock i had fill the first two with my linen and as i had still much to pack away i was natur annoy at not have the use of the third drawer it struck me that it might have been fasten by a mere oversight so i took out my bunch of key and tri to open it the veri first key fit to perfect and i drew the drawer open there was onli one thing in it but i am sure that you would never guess what it was it was my coil of hair i took it up and examin it it was of the same peculiar tint and the same thick but then the imposs of the thing obtrud itself upon me how could my hair have been lock in the drawer with trembl hand i undid my trunk turn out the content and drew from the bottom my own hair i laid the two tress togeth and i assur you that they were ident was it not extraordinari puzzl as i would i could make noth at all of what it meant i return the strang hair to the drawer and i said noth of the matter to the rucastl as i felt that i had put myself in the wrong by open a drawer which they had lock i am natur observ as you may have remark mr holm and i soon had a pretti good plan of the whole hous in my head there was one wing howev which appear not to be inhabit at all a door which face that which led into the quarter of the toller open into this suit but it was invari lock one day howev as i ascend the stair i met mr rucastl come out through this door his key in his hand and a look on his face which made him a veri differ person to the round jovial man to whom i was accustom his cheek were red his brow was all crinkl with anger and the vein stood out at his templ with passion he lock the door and hurri past me without a word or a look this arous my curios so when i went out for a walk in the ground with my charg i stroll round to the side from which i could see the window of this part of the hous there were four of them in a row three of which were simpli dirti while the fourth was shutter up they were evid all desert as i stroll up and down glanc at them occasion mr rucastl came out to me look as merri and jovial as ever ah said he you must not think me rude if i pass you without a word my dear young ladi i was preoccupi with busi matter i assur him that i was not offend by the way said i you seem to have quit a suit of spare room up there and one of them has the shutter up he look surpris and as it seem to me a littl startl at my remark photographi is one of my hobbi said he i have made my dark room up there but dear me what an observ young ladi we have come upon who would have believ it who would have ever believ it he spoke in a jest tone but there was no jest in his eye as he look at me i read suspicion there and annoy but no jest well mr holm from the moment that i understood that there was someth about that suit of room which i was not to know i was all on fire to go over them it was not mere curios though i have my share of that it was more a feel of dutya feel that some good might come from my penetr to this place they talk of woman instinct perhap it was woman instinct which gave me that feel at ani rate it was there and i was keen on the lookout for ani chanc to pass the forbidden door it was onli yesterday that the chanc came i may tell you that besid mr rucastl both toller and his wife find someth to do in these desert room and i onc saw him carri a larg black linen bag with him through the door recent he has been drink hard and yesterday even he was veri drunk and when i came upstair there was the key in the door i have no doubt at all that he had left it there mr and mrs rucastl were both downstair and the child was with them so that i had an admir opportun i turn the key gentl in the lock open the door and slip through there was a littl passag in front of me unpap and uncarpet which turn at a right angl at the farther end round this corner were three door in a line the first and third of which were open they each led into an empti room dusti and cheerless with two window in the one and one in the other so thick with dirt that the even light glimmer dim through them the centr door was close and across the outsid of it had been fasten one of the broad bar of an iron bed padlock at one end to a ring in the wall and fasten at the other with stout cord the door itself was lock as well and the key was not there this barricad door correspond clear with the shutter window outsid and yet i could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in dark evid there was a skylight which let in light from abov as i stood in the passag gaze at the sinist door and wonder what secret it might veil i sudden heard the sound of step within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the littl slit of dim light which shone out from under the door a mad unreason terror rose up in me at the sight mr holm my overstrung nerv fail me sudden and i turn and ranran as though some dread hand were behind me clutch at the skirt of my dress i rush down the passag through the door and straight into the arm of mr rucastl who was wait outsid so said he smile it was you then i thought that it must be when i saw the door open oh i am so frighten i pant my dear young ladi my dear young ladyyou cannot think how caress and sooth his manner wasand what has frighten you my dear young ladi but his voic was just a littl too coax he overdid it i was keen on my guard against him i was foolish enough to go into the empti wing i answer but it is so lone and eeri in this dim light that i was

keep peopl out who have no busi there do you see he was still smile in the most amiabl manner i am sure if i had known well then you know now and if you ever put your foot over that threshold againher in an instant the smile harden into a grin of rage and he glare down at me with the face of a demonil throw you to the mastiff i was so terrifi that i do not know what i did i suppos that i must have rush past him into my room i rememb noth until i found myself lie on my bed trembl all over then i thought of you mr holm i could not live there longer without some advic i was frighten of the hous of the man of the woman of the servant even of the child they were all horribl to me if i could onli bring you down all would be well of cours i might have fled from the hous but my curios was almost as strong as my fear my mind was soon made up i would send you a wire i put on my hat and cloak went down to the offic which is about half a mile from the hous and then return feel veri much easier a horribl doubt came into my mind as i approach the door lest the dog might be loos but i rememb that toller had drunk himself into a state of insens that even and i knew that he was the onli one in the household who had ani influenc with the savag creatur or who would ventur to set him free i slip in in safeti and lay awak half the night in my joy at the thought of see you i had no difficulti in get leav to come into winchest this morn but i must be back befor three oclock for mr and mrs rucastl are go on a visit and will be away all the even so that i must look after the child now i have told you all my adventur mr holm and i should be veri glad if you could tell me what it all mean and abov all what i should do holm and i had listen spellbound to this extraordinari stori my friend rose now and pace up and down the room his hand in his pocket and an express of the most profound graviti upon his face is toller still drunk he ask yes i heard his wife tell mrs rucastl that she could do noth with him that is well and the rucastl go out to night yes is there a cellar with a good strong lock yes the wine cellar you seem to me to have act all through this matter like a veri brave and sensibl girl miss hunter do you think that you could perform one more feat i should not ask it of you if i did not think you a quit except woman i will tri what is it we shall be at the copper beech by seven oclock my friend and i the rucastl will be gone by that time and toller will we hope be incap there onli remain mrs toller who might give the alarm if you could send her into the cellar on some errand and then turn the key upon her you would facilit matter immens i will do it excel we shall then look thorough into the affair of cours there is onli one feasibl explan you have been brought there to person someon and the real person is imprison in this chamber that is obvious as to who this prison is i have no doubt that it is the daughter miss alic rucastl if i rememb right who was said to have gone to america you were chosen doubtless as resembl her in height figur and the colour of your hair her had been cut off veri possibl in some ill through which she has pass and so of cours your had to be sacrif also by a curious chanc you came upon her tress the man in the road was undoubt some friend of hersposs her fianceand no doubt as you wore the girl dress and were so like her he was convinc from your laughter whenev he saw you and afterward from your gestur that miss rucastl was perfect happi and that she no longer desir his attent the dog is let loos at night to prevent him from endeavour to communic with her so much is fair clear the most serious point in the case is the disposit of the child what on earth has that to do with it i ejacul my dear watson you as a medic man are continu gain light as to the tendenc of a child by the studi of the parent dont you see that the convers is equal valid i have frequent gain my first real insight into the charact of parent by studi their children this child disposit is abnorm cruel mere for cruelti sake and whether he deriv this from his smile father as i should suspect or from his mother it bode evil for the poor girl who is in their power i am sure that you are right mr holm cri our client a thousand thing come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it oh let us lose not an instant in bring help to this poor creatur we must be circumspect for we are deal with a veri cun man we can do noth until seven oclock at that hour we shall be with you and it will not be long befor we solv the mysteri we were as good as our word for it was just seven when we reach the copper beech have put up our trap at a waysid public hous the group of tree with their dark leav shine like burnish metal in the light of the set sun were suffici to mark the hous even had miss hunter not been stand smile on the door step have you manag it ask holm a loud thud nois came from somewher downstair that is mrs toller in the cellar said she her husband lie snore on the kitchen rug here are his key which are the duplic of mr rucastl you have done well inde cri holm with enthusiasm now lead the way and we shall soon see the end of this black busi we pass up the stair unlock the door follow on down a passag and found ourselv in front of the barricad which miss hunter had describ holm cut the cord and remov the transvers bar then he tri the various key in the lock but without success no sound came from within and at the silenc holm face cloud over i trust that we are not too late said he i think miss hunter that we had better go in without you now watson put your shoulder to it and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in it was an old ricketi door and gave at onc befor our unit strength togeth we rush into the room it was empti there was no furnitur save a littl pallet bed a small tabl and a basket of linen the skylight abov was open and the prison gone there has been some villaini here said holm this beauti has guess miss hunter intent and has carri his victim off but how through the skylight we shall soon see how he manag it he swung himself up onto the roof ah yes he cri here the end of a long light ladder against the eav that is how he did it but it is imposs said miss hunter the ladder was not there when the rucastl went away he has come back and done it i tell you that he is a clever and danger man i should not be veri much surpris if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair i think watson that it would be as well for you to have your pistol readi the word were hard out of his mouth befor a man appear at the door of the room a veri fat and bur man with a heavi stick in his hand miss hunter scream and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him but sherlock holm sprang forward and confront him you villain said he where your daughter the fat man cast his eye round and then up at the open skylight it is for me to ask you that he shriek you thiev spi and thiev i have caught you have i you are in my power ill serv you he turn and clatter down the stair as hard as he could go hes gone for the dog cri miss hunter i have my revolv said i better close the front door cri holm and we all rush down the stair togeth we had hard reach the hall when we heard the bay of a hound and then a scream of agoni with a horribl worri sound which it was dread to listen to an elder man with a red face and shake limb came stagger out at a side door my god he cri someon has loos the dog it not been fed for two day quick quick or itll be too late holm and i rush out and round the angl of the hous with toller hurri behind us there was the huge famish brute it black muzzl buri in rucastl throat while he writh and scream upon the ground run up i blew it brain out and it fell over with it keen white teeth still meet in the great creas of his neck with much labour we separ them and carri him live but horribl mangl into the hous we laid him upon the draw room sofa and have dispatch the sober toller to bear the news to his wife i did what i could to reliev his pain we were all assembl round him when the door open and a tall gaunt woman enter the room mrs toller cri miss hunter yes miss mr rucastl let me out when he came back befor he went up to you ah miss it is a piti you didnt let me know what you were plan for i would have told you that your pain were wast ha said holm look keen at her it is clear that mrs toller know more about this matter than anyon els yes sir i do and i am readi enough to tell what i know then pray sit down and let us hear it for there are sever point on which i must confess that i am still in the dark i will soon make it clear to you said she and id have done so befor now if i could ha got out from the cellar if there polic court busi over this youll rememb that i was the one that stood your friend and that i was miss alic friend too she was never happi at home miss alic wasnt from the time that her father marri again she was slight like and had no say in anyth but it never realli becam bad for her until after she met mr fowler at a friend hous as well as i could learn miss alic had right of her own by will but she was so quiet and patient she was that she never said a word about them but just left everyth in mr rucastl hand he knew he was safe with her but when there was a chanc of a husband come forward who would ask for all that the law would give him then her father thought it time to put a stop on it he want her to sign a paper so that whether she marri or not he could use her money when she wouldnt do it he kept on worri her until she got brain fever and for six week was at death door then she got better at last all worn to a shadow and with her beauti hair cut off but that didnt make no chang in her young man and he stuck to her as true as man could be ah said holm i think that what you have been good enough to tell us make the matter fair clear and that i can deduc all that remain mr rucastl then i presum took to this system of imprison yes sir and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of the disagre persist of mr fowler that was it sir but mr fowler be a persev man as a good seaman should be blockad the hous and have met you succeed by certain argument metal or otherwis in convinc you that your interest were the same as his mr fowler was a veri kind spoken free hand gentleman said mrs toller seren and in this way he manag that your good man should have no want of drink and that a ladder should be readi at the moment when your master had gone out you have it sir just as it happen i am sure we owe you an apolog mrs toller said holm for you have certain clear up everyth which puzzl us and here come the countri surgeon and mrs rucastl so i think watson that we had best escort miss hunter back to winchest as it seem to me that our locus standi now is rather a question one and thus was solv the mysteri of the sinist hous with the copper beech in front of the door mr rucastl surviv but was alway a broken man kept aliv sole through the care of his devot wife they still live with their old servant who probabl know so much of rucastl past life that he find it difficult to part from them mr fowler and miss rucastl were marri by special licens in southampton the day after their flight and he is now the holder of a govern appoint in the island of mauritius as to miss violet hunter my friend holm rather to my disappoint manifest no further interest in her when onc she had ceas to be the centr of one of his problem and she is now the head of a privat school at walsal where i believ that she has met with consider success
