book proclaim the end of literaci as it also account for the incred forc at work in our restless shift world the end of literaci a chasm between a not so distant yesterday and the excit though confus tomorrow is probabl more difficult to understand than to live with reluct to acknowledg chang onli make thing wors we notic that liter languag use doe not work as we assum or were told it should and

invest more in order to maintain literaci skill professor groan under the prospect of ill prepar student enter colleg publish redefin their strategi as new form of express and communic vie for public attent and dollar lawyer journalist the militari and politician worri about the role and function of languag in societi probabl most concern with their own role in the social structur and with the legitimaci of their institut they would preserv those structur of human activ that justifi literaci and thus their own posit of power and influenc the few who believ that literaci compris not onli skill but also ideal and valu say that the destini of our civil is at stake and that the declin in literaci has dread implic opportun is not part of the discours or argument the major accomplish of analyz illiteraci so far has been the list of symptom the decreas in function literaci a general degrad of write skill and read comprehens an alarm increas of packag languag clich use in speech can messag and a general tendenc to substitut visual media especi televis and video for written languag parallel to scholarship on the subject a massiv but unfocus public opinion campaign has result in all kind of literaci enterpris frequent use stereotyp that in themselv affect languag qualiti such enterpris plead for teach adult who cannot read or write for improv languag studi in all grade and for rais public awar of illiteraci and it various implic still we do not realli understand the necessari charact of the declin of literaci histor and systemat aspect of function illiteraci as well as languag degrad are minim address they are phenomena that affect not onli the unit state countri with a long cultur tradit and which make the preserv and liter use of languag a public institut experi them as well my interest in the subject of illiteraci was trigger by two factor the person experi of be uproot from an east european cultur that stubborn defend and maintain rigid structur of literaci and involv in what are common describ as new technolog i end up in the usa a land of unstructur and flaw literaci but also one of amaz dynam here i join those who experienc the consequ of the low qualiti of educ as well as the open of new opportun the major of these are disconnect from what is go on in school and univers this is how and whi i start think like mani other about altern my mayflow if i may use the analog to the pilgrim brought me to individu who do mani thing shop work play or watch sport travel go to church even love with an acut sens of immediaci worshipp of the instant my new compatriot serv as a contrast to those who on the european contin i came from conscienti strive for perman of famili work valu tool home applianc car build in contrast the usa is a place where everyth is the present the come moment not onli televis program and advertis made me awar of this fact book are as perman as their surviv on bestsel list the market with it increas breathtak fluctuat might today celebr a compani that tomorrow disappear for good commenc ceremoni famili life busi commit religi practic succeed fashion song presid dentur cream car model movi and practic everyth els embodi the same obsess languag and literaci could not escap this obsess with chang becaus of my work as a univers professor i was in the trench where battl of literaci are fought that is where i came to realiz that a better curriculum multicultur or not or better paid teacher or cheaper and better book could make a differ but would not chang the outcom the declin of literaci is an encompass phenomenon imposs to reduc to the state of educ to a nation econom rank to the status of social ethnic religi or racial group to a polit system or to cultur histori there was life befor literaci and there will be life after it in fact it has alreadi begun let us not forget that literaci is a relat late acquisit in human cultur the time preced write is 99 of the entir stori of the human be my posit in the discuss is one of question histor continu as a premis for literaci if we can understand what the end of literaci as we know it mean in practic term we will avoid further lament and initi a cours of action from which all can benefit moreov if we can get an idea of what to expect beyond the safe haven now fade on the horizon then we will be abl to come up with improv more effect model of educ at the same time we will comprehend what individu need in order to success ascertain their manifold natur improv human interact for which new technolog are plenti avail should be the concret result of this understand of the end of the civil of literaci the first ironi of ani public on illiteraci is that it is inaccess to those who are the veri subject of the concern of literaci partisan inde the major of the million activ on the internet read at most a 3 sentenc short paragraph the attent span of student in high school and univers is not much shorter than that of their instructor one type page legisl no less than bureaucrat thrive on execut summari a 30 second tv spot is mani time more influenti than a 4 column in depth articl but those who give life and dynam to realiti use mean other than those whose continu predomin this book question the second ironi is that this book also present argument which are in their logic sequenc depend on the convent of read and write as a medium for constitut and interpret histori write definit influenc how we think and what we think about i wonder how my argument would hold up in an interact non linear medium of communic in which we can question each other and which also make authorship if not irrelev the last thing someon would worri about sinc i have use languag to think through this book i know that it would make less sens in a differ medium this lead me to state from the outset almost as self encourag that literaci whose end i discuss will not disappear for some literaci studi will becom a new specialti as sanskrit or ancient greek has becom for a hand of expert for other it will becom a skill as it is alreadi for editor proofread and profession writer for the major it will continu in literaci that facilit the use and integr of new media and new form of communic and interpret the utopian in me say that we will find way to reinvent literaci if not save it it has play a major role in lead to the new civil we are enter the realist acknowledg that new time and challeng requir new mean to cope with their complex reluct to acknowledg chang doe not prevent it from come about it onli prevent us from make the best of it probabl my activ practic of literaci has been match by all those mean comput base or not for cope with complex to whose design and realize i contribut this book is not an exercis in prophesi a brave new world of peopl happi to know less but all that they have to know when they need to neither is it about individu who are superfici but who adapt more easili to chang mediocr but extrem competit it subject is languag and everyth pertain to it famili and sexual polit the market what and how we eat how we dress the war we fight love sport and more it is a book about ourselv who give life to word whenev we speak write or read we give life to imag sound textur to multimedia and virtual realiti involv ourselv in new interact transcend boundari of literaci in practic experi for which literaci is no longer appropri mean ultim to grow into a new civil progress toward illiteraci here is as good a place as ani to explain my perspect languag involv human be in all their aspect biolog sens of space and time cognit and manual skill emot resourc sensit tendenc to social interact and polit organ but what best defin our relat to languag is the pragmat of our exist our continu self constitut through what we do whi we do and how we do all we actual do in short human pragmat involv languag but is not reduc to it the pragmat perspect i assum origin with charl sander peirc when i began teach in the usa my american colleagu and student did not know who he was the semiot implic of this text relat to his work question how knowledg is share peirc notic that without talk about the bearer of our knowledg all the sign carrier we constitut we would not be abl to figur out how result of our inquiri are integr in our deed action and theori languag and the format and express of idea is uniqu to human in that they defin a part of the cognit dimens of our pragmat we seem endow with languag as we are with hear sight touch smell and tast but behind the appear is a process through which human self constitut led to the possibl and necess of languag as it led to the human of our sens furthermor it led to the mean by which we constitut ourselv as liter as the pragmat of our exist requir under ever chang circumst the appear is that literaci is a use tool when in fact it result in the pragmat context we can use a hammer or a comput but we are our languag the experi of languag extend to the experi of the logic it embodi as well as to that of the institut that languag and literaci made possibl these in turn influenc what we are and how we think what we do and whi we do so doe everi tool applianc and machin we use and so do all the peopl with whom we interact our interact with peopl with natur or with artifact we ourselv generat further affect the pragmat self constitut

reader who think i stretch the term literaci too far should keep in mind all that literaci compris in our cultur in contrast illiteraci no matter what it caus or what other attribut an individu label illiter has is seen as someth harm and shame to be avoid at ani price without an understand that encompass our valu and way of think we cannot perceiv how a civil can progress to illiteraci mani peopl are will to be part of post liter societi but by no mean are they will to be label member of a civil qualifi as illiter by civil of illiteraci i mean one in which liter characterist no longer

through imposit of it rule which prevent practic experi of human self constitut in domain where literaci has exhaust it potenti or is impot in describ the post liter i know that ani metaphor will do as long as it doe not call undu attent to itself what count is not the provoc but that we lift our gaze determin to see not just to look for the comfort familiar this civil of illiteraci is one of mani literaci each with it own characterist and rule of function some of such partial literaci are base on configur mode of express as in the written languag of japan china or korea on visual form of

gone by sinc i start think and write about the civil of illiteraci mani of the direct i brought into discuss are make it into the public domain but i should be the last to be surpris or unhappi that realiti chang befor i was abl to finish this book and befor publish could make up their mind about print it the internet was not yet drive the stock market neither had the writer of futur shock had publish their book churn propheci nor had compani made fortun in multimedia when the idea that go into this book were discuss with student present in public lectur outlin to polici maker includ administr in higher educ and print in scholar journal on start this book i want it to be not onli a present of event and trend but a program for practic action this is whi after examin of what could be call the theoret aspect the focus shift to the appli the book end with suggest for practic measur to be consid as altern to the beaten path of the bandag method that onli put off radic treatment even when it inevit is acknowledg yes i like to see my idea test and appli even taken over and develop further credit given or not i would rather put up with a negat outcom in discuss follow public of

easili understood by give some life to this dri evalu origin from peopl in the busi of quantifi data process zizi the hairdress and her companion exemplifi today liter popul portray by han magnus enzensberg she is contrast to pascal who at the age of sixteen had alreadi publish his work on conic section to hugo grotius who graduat from colleg at fifteen and to melanchton who at the age of

the world he live in was small to explain it work one did not need to master mathemat or physic but philosophi sinc melanchton can no longer be subject to multipl choic or to iq test we will never know if he could make it into colleg today the question pose about all the charact introduc is a simpl one who is more ignor melanchton or zizi enzensberg exampl are from germani but the phenomena he bring to his reader attent transcend nation boundari he himself writer poet publish is far from be an internet buff although he might be as inform about it as his charact are as oppos to mani other writer on literaci and educ enzensberg confirm that the effici reach in the civil of illiteraci he doe not call it that make it possibl to extend adolesc well into what use to be the more product time in the life of past generat everyon goe to colleg in some countri colleg educ is a right this mean that over half of the young peopl enter some form of higher educ after graduat they find out that they still dont know what they want or wors yet that what they know or are certifi as know is of no consequ to what they are expect to do they will live like zizi from social benefit and will get extrem angri at anyon question societi abil to provid them for them effici of human practic experi translat into the right to not worri whether they will ever contribut to this effici while still student they demand and probabl right so that everyth be to the point the problem is that neither they nor their teacher can defin what that mean what student get are more choic among less signific subject that at least is how it look they probabl never finish a book from cover to cover assign are given to them in small portion and usual with photocopi page which they are expect to read a question and answer sheet is conveni attach with the hope that the student will read the page to find the answer and not copi them from more dedic classmat that zizi probabl has a vocabulari as rich as that of a 16th centuri scholar in the human can be assum that she like use fewer than 1000 of these word onli say that this is how much she need in order to function effici melanchton use almost all the word he knew his work requir masteri of literaci so that he could express everi new idea prompt by the few new practic experi of human self constitut he was involv in or awar of he spoke and

as such or assum label of conveni the conflict characterist of this time of fundament chang has it locus in literaci and more specif in the direct of chang toward the civil of illiteraci at first glanc it is exceed difficult to say whether languag as an instrument of continu and perman is fail becaus the rhythm of exist has acceler increas sinc the industri revolut or the rhythm of exist has acceler becaus human interact is no longer at the merci of languag we do not know whether this acceler is due to or nourish by chang in languag and the way peopl use it or if chang in languag reflect this acceler it is quit plausibl that the use of imag moreov of interact multimedia and network base exchang of complex data are more appropri to a faster pace societi than text requir more time and concentr but it is less clear whether we use imag and synesthet mean of express becaus we want to be faster and thus more effici or we can be faster and improv effici if we use such mean shorter term of human interact and for exampl the chang in the status of the famili have someth in common the new polit condit of the individu in modern societi also has someth in common with the characterist of human interact and the mean of this interact but again we do not realli know whether the new socio econom dynam result from our intent to acceler interact or the acceler in human interact is onli the background or a margin effect of a more encompass chang of our condit under circumst make this chang necessari my hypothesi is that a dramat chang in the scale of humankind and in the natur of the relat between human and their natur and cultur environ might explain the new socio econom dynam load literaci languag or ani other form of express and communic are meaning onli to the extent that they becom part of our exist when peopl do not know how to spell word that refer to their exist we suspect that someth relat to the learn of spell usual the learner doe not function as we assum it should obvious literaci is more than spell school famili new habit such as extens televis view comic read obsess play of comput game internet surf to name some of the appar culprit come under scrutini cultur prejudic or fear of the unknown prevent us from ask whether spell is still a necess coward conform stop us short from suspect that someth might be wrong with languag or with those literaci expect deepli anchor in all known polit program thrown into our face when our vote is elicit when spell and phonet are as inconsist as they are in english especi this suspicion led to the examin and creation of altern alphabet and to altern artifici languag which we shall examin but spell fail even in languag with more consist relat between pronunci and write becaus we inherit along with our rever for languag a passiv attitud regard what is logic permiss under the guis of literaci we do not question implicit assumpt and expect of literaci for instanc the belief that command of languag enhanc cognit skill although we know that cognit process are not exact reduc to languag is accept without hesit it is ascertain that liter peopl from no matter what countri can communic better and learn foreign languag more easili this is not alway the case in realiti languag are rather load system of convent in which nation bias and other inclin are extens embodi and maintain and even propag through speech write and read this expect lead to well intend though disput statement such as you can never understand one languag until you understand at least two sign by searl there is also the implic that liter peopl have better access to the art and scienc the reason for this is that languag as a univers mean of communic is consequ the onli mean that ultim explain scientif theori work of art propon of languag argu can be reduc to verbal descript or at least be better access through the languag use to index them through label classif categori anoth assumpt and prejudic is that the level of perform in and outsid languag is in direct relat to compet acquir in literaci this prejudic from among all other will come under closer scrutini becaus though literaci is declin languag use deviat from that norm by literaci take astonish form man propos man dispos knowledg of the connect between languag take the appear of entiti with live of their own and peopl constitut them with the appear of have unlimit control over their languag is essenti for understand the shift from a literaci domin civil to one of multipl mean of express and communic these mean could be call languag if an appropri definit of such languag and the literaci associ with them could be provid in light of what has been alreadi mention the broader context of the chang in the status of literaci is the pragmat framework of our exist it is not onli that the use of languag has diminish or it qualiti decreas rather it is the acknowledg of a veri complex realiti of a biolog and cultur modifi human be face appar choic difficult if not imposs to harmon life is faster pace not becaus biolog rhythm abrupt chang but becaus a new pragmat framework of higher effici came about human interact extend in our day beyond the

reach it address less than two percent of all the inform thrown into mass media communic reach it audienc at this level of effici no car would ever move no plane could take off babi could not even roll over in their crib the depend of communic on literaci prove to be communic strength it deliv a potenti audienc but it prove to be it weak too the assumpt that among liter peopl communic not onli take place but base on the impli share background is alway success was found to be wrong time and again experi such as war conflict among nation communiti profession group academia a high liter social

characterist of a pragmat context defin by literaci do not automat make societi better or fairer but a distribut of wealth and power and a redefinit of the goal and method through which democraci is

impli the integr of minor by appropri their activ and cultur sometim replac their own with the domin literaci in total disregard of their heritag if write did not suffic to consolid knowledg observ

quit a few were record in and on various materi and so can languag as we all know but languag did not start out as a written system the african ishango bone predat a write system by some thousand of

languag through it use onli at that moment did languag gain a semant and syntact dimens as we call them in today terminolog formal if the issu of literaci and the constitut of languag are connect then this connect start with written languag nevertheless event preced written languag give us the perspect of what made write necessari and whi some cultur never develop a written languag although refer to a differ time frame thousand of year ago this could help us comprehend whi write and read need not domin life and work today and in the futur or at least it could help clarifi the relat among human be their languag and their exist after all this is what we want to understand from the vantag point of today world we take the word for grant wonder whether there was a stage of the wordless human be about which we can onli infer indirect but onc the word was establish with the advent of the mean for record it it affect not onli the futur but also the percept of the past conquer the past the word give legitimaci to explan that presum it thus it impli some carri devic ie a system of notat as a built in memori and as a mechan for associ permut and substitut but if such a system is accept the origin of write and read are push back so far in time that the disjunct of liter illiter becom a structur characterist of the speci at one of the period of it self definit obvious expand far in time and seen in such a broad perspect this notat compris imag the ishango bone quipus the vinca figurin etc contradict the logocrat model of languag mono and polysyllab element of speech embodi audibl

what we are do say write or read are relat the experi behind languag use and the biolog characterist of peopl live in a languag differ to such an extent that almost never will similar event even the

the memori of a liter societi becom more and more a repositori of the various mediat in social life and lose it relat to direct experi thing said what the greek call legomena are differ from thing

evalu in a simpl statement languag has chang so much that in order to understand text origin at the time of this critic we have to translat and annot them some are alreadi reconstitut from write of a

base on the fast chang experi of reveal one illiter ident word about imag the written as we know almost constant appear togeth with other referenti system especi imag in this respect a question regard what we understand when we understand languag is whether imag can be use as an aid to understand text doubtless pictur at least some of them are by their cognit attribut better bearer of interpret clue than are some word or write devic imag more so than text can stand in for the absent writer to the extent that they follow convent of realiti pictur can help the individu reconstitut at least partial the frame of time and space or one of the two howev this repres onli one side of the issu the other side reveal that imag are not alway the best conveyor of inform and that what we gain by use them come at a cost in understand clariti or context depend first of all what is gain through the abstract of the word is almost entir lost through the concret of the imag the veri dens medium of write stand in sharp contrast to the dilut medium of imag to download text on the network is quit differ from display imag if this were the onli reason we would be alert to the differ between imag and text when the complex of the imag reach high level decod the imag becom as tedious as decod text and the result less precis all this explain whi peopl tri to use a combin of imag and word it also help

text and imag to paraphras text through imag or substitut text for imag or imag for text result in forc way of influenc interpret by introduc explanatori context a veri larg portion of today cultur from the comic strip to pictur novel and advertis to soap opera on the internet is embodi in work use such and similar strategi what interest us here is whether imag can replac the experi requir to understand a text if the answer is affirm such imag would be almost like the partner in convers as product of human experi imag just like languag embodi that particular experi this automat make the problem of understand imag more involv than just see them but we knew this from written languag see word or sentenc or text on paper in script or in print is onli preliminari to understand the natur of imag especi those resembl the physic univers of our exist make access to them sometim easier than access to written languag but this access is never automat and should never be taken for grant in addit while the written word doe not invit to imit imag play a more activ role trigger reaction differ from those trigger by word the code of languag and visual code are not reduc to each other neither is their pragmat function the same research report are quasi unanim in emphas that the use of pictur in increas text comprehens seem not to depend on the mere presenc of the imag but on the specif characterist of the reader these make clear the role play by what was defin as background knowledg without which text imag and other form of express stabil as languag make littl sens if ani to their reader viewer or listen in order to arriv at such conclus research went through real time measur of the so call process of text in comparison to pictur text process the paradigm employ use eye

this has been known for at least 300 year if not longer actor in shakespear time were prompt to recal their line through visual cue embodi in the architectur of the theater after all was measur and analyz the onli depend conclus was that the effect of imag on comprehens of written languag are not easi to explain again this should not come as a surpris as long as we use literaci base quantifi to understand the limit of literaci whether imag are accident or forc upon the reader whether the text is quasi linear or veri sophist ie result from practic experi of high complex the relat doe not seem

recent year despit effort made by school parent employ and govern to improv instruct remain unansw regardless of how much we are will to help the understand of a text through the use of imag the necess of the text as an express of a liter practic experi is not enhanc conclus like these are not easi to draw becaus we are still condit by literaci experi outsid the frame of literaci come much

even celebr here precis becaus they extend to the differ logic that pertain to various practic experi formul as such the answer is elus becaus after all logic is express through languag and onc express it constitut a bodi of knowledg which in turn particip in practic human experi no stronger proof of this can be given than the boolean logic embed in comput hardwar and program languag a more appropri answer can be given onc we notic that major languag system embodi differ logic mechan that pertain to languag coordin function the main logic system requir our attent becaus they are relat to what make literaci necessari and under new pragmat condit less necessari if not superflu sinc the civil of illiteraci is view also from the perspect of the chang result in a new scale of human praxi it becom necessari to see whether in the global world forc of uniform or forc of heterogen and divers embodi in various literaci and the logic attach to them or associ with their use are at work as almost all scholar agre aristotl is the father of the logic that appli to the western languag system write help to encod his logic of proper infer from premis express in sentenc literaci gave this logic a hous and a sens of valid and perman that scholar accept almost as religion for eastern system contribut of equal valu and relev can be found in the major write of ancient china and japan as well as in hindu document instead of a superfici overview of the subject i prefer to quot fung yu lan precis observ regard the particular focus of chines philosophi which is also repres of the far east philosophi must not be simpli the object of cognit it must also be the object of an experi the result express of this endeavor differ from the indian in search of a certain state of mind not formul of truth and from western philosoph statement it take the form of concis often enigmat and usual paradox statement or aphor a veri good present of this experi is given in a famous text by chuang tzu the word serv to fix the idea but onc the idea is grasp there is no need to think about word i wish i could find somebodi who has ceas to think of word and have him with me to talk to the logic of the indo european languag is base on the recognit of the object action distinct express in languag through the noun and the verb for over 2000 year this logic has domin and maintain the structur of societi of the poli to use aristotl term inde he defin the human as zoon politikon communiti poli anim zoon and his logic is an attempt to discov what was the cognit structur that ensur proper infer from premis express in sentenc probabl as much as some who today hope for a similar achiev through formal languag he want logic to be as independ as possibl of the languag use as well as independ of the particular languag spoken by peopl belong to differ communiti parallel to the languag hous aristotl logic was a differ system in which the verb refer to action was assimil in the object as in the chines and japanes languag everi action becam a noun hunt run talk and a non predic languag mode was achiev aristotl construct goe like this if a is b the sky is cover and if b is c the cover are cloud then a is c cloudi sky non predic construct do not come to a conclus but continu from one condit to anoth as in approxim be cover cover be cloud cloud be associ with rain rainand so on that is they are open end connect in status nascendi we notic that aristotelian logic deriv the truth of the infer from the truth of the premis base on a formal relat independ of both in non predic logic languag onli point to possibl chain of relat implicit acknowledg that other are simultan possibl without deriv knowledg or without subject conclus to a formal test of their truth or

alreadi accumul first of all that ideograph write keep the mean of express veri close to the object repres in languag we can understand whi languag express in ideograph write are not adapt to the kind of think aristotl and his follow develop and which culmin in the western notion of scienc as well as in the western system of valu the success rediscoveri of far eastern mode of represent and of the philosophi grow out of this veri differ way of think as well as of the interest in subtleti rather uncommon to our cultur result in the mani attempt we wit to transcend the boundari between these fundament differ languag structur the purpos is to endow our languag and thus our think and emot life with dimens structur imposs within the western framework of exist the logic of depend the japanes ame is one of embed relat and mani conjectur result in a logic of action a differ way of think and a differ system of valu these are partial reflect in the period misunderstand between the western

no matter what ame can also be simplifi to mean a mutual relationship within famili all prejudic includ or among friend but as we get closer to the practic experi of ame takeo doi write on the anatomi

fair to question whether logic is affect by scale again the answer will depend upon who is ask logic as we studi it has noth to do with scale an infer remain preserv no matter how mani peopl make it or studi it for that matter but this reflect the universalist viewpoint onc we question the constitut of logic itself and trace it to practic experi result in the awar of connect it becom less obvious that logic is independ of scale actual some experi are not even possibl without have reach a critic mass and the relat between simpl and complex is not one of progress but it is certain a multi valu relat grant with element of progress the practic experi of a tribe in africa north america or south america is defin at the scale of relat insid the tribe and between the tribe and the relat limit

various group of peopl are integr as human in the first place not as tribe nation or religion and consequ a pragmat framework of increas integr is progress put in place the euro centrist or western

the languag of design and engin includ result in the awar of mediat which itself becam a goal mediat of mediat with the risk of break the continu of the argument i would like to continu by suggest the

life administr and cafeteria head combin would perform today is worth anoth tale educ as a product of the civil of literaci has problem understand that literaci correspond to a develop in which

from the realiti of econom with or without the aid of philanthropi learn has to free itself from it subordin to literaci and restrict liter structur as it previous freed itself from it subordin to the church in whose bosom it was nurtur obvious if this new awar manifest itself onli in mail out videotap instead of print colleg catalogu then we may ask whether it is educ or onli market who understand the current dynam the same should be ask when some professor put their cours on tape in the belief that can knowledg is easier for the student to absorb on line class break with the mold but they are not yet the answer at least as long as they do not belong to a broader vision reflect in differ prioriti and appropri content there is noth intrins bad about involv media in educ but the problem is not the medium for storag and deliveri media lab that are cover by dust becaus they convey the same useless inform as the class they were suppos to enhanc onli prove that a fundament chang is necessari fundament for instanc is the skew notion that knowledg is transfer from professor who know more to student who know less actual we face a realiti never befor experienc student know more than their teacher in some disciplin in addit knowledg still appropri to a subject a short time ago call it histori polit or econom and think about class in soviet and east european studi has been render

becom an internet address for unlimit and unstructur brows should educ give up ani sens of foundat or should univers period refresh their genet make up in order to maintain contact with the most recent theori the most recent research techniqu the most recent discoveri these are more than enough question for a pen still write one word at a time or for a mouth answer question as they pile up without pose these question to which some answer will be attempt at the conclus of this book no solut can be expect the willing of educ and everyon affect by educ to formul them and mani more would bear wit to a concern that cannot be address by some miracul all encompass formula the good news is that in mani part of the world this is happen final the equat of a compromis as the scale of humankind chang and the effici of human practic experi correspond to the scale ascertain itself as the new ration the practic experi of self constitut had to adjust to new circumst of exist and activ there is no magic borderlin but there is a definit discontinu between what constitut the relat stabl under structur of literaci and what constitut the fast chang under structur of the pragmat framework becaus in our own self constitut literaci is onli one among mani media for achiev the effici that the new scale requir we come to realiz even if public discours doe not exact reflect it that we cannot afford literaci the way we have until now and even if we could we should not peopl recogn even if onli reluct that the literaci machin for some reason still call educ endow the new generat with a skill of limit signific the result perspect is continu contradict by the ever new and ever renew human experi through which we becom who we are educ base on the paradigm of literaci is as we have seen a luxuri which a societi rich or poor cannot afford condit of human life and praxi requir instead of a skill and perspect for the whole of life a seri skill and perspect need to be

over those of the modern languag associ mathemat prepar for field from technic to manageri from scientif to philosoph and from design to legal the realize that calculus is first of all a languag and that the goal of educ is fluenci in it correspond to an awar that musician had for the longest time with respect to music score but the champion of literaci alway refus to accept the same hold true for the disciplin of visual draw comput graphic design in today educ the visual need to be studi at least as much as languag depend subject against the background of deeper chang educ is focus on it

societi pressur educ in our day remain a compromis between the interest of the institut of educ with ten of thousand of teacher who would becom unemploy and a new pragmat framework that few in academia understand one of the element of this equat is the practic need to extend educ to all and if possibl on a continu basi but unless this educ reflect the varieti of literaci that the pragmat

burden when the highest goal of a professor is to be freed of teach someth is aw wrong with our legitim decis to guarante educ the freedom necessari for exercis their profess behind the test model that drive much of current educ is the expect of effect rank of student this model take a liter approach insofar as it establish a dichotomi aptitud vs achiev that make student react to question but doe not realli engag them or encourag creativ contribut the result is illustr of the relat between what we do and how we evalu what we do an expect was set and the process of educ was skew to generat good test result this effect elimin teach and learn for the sake of a subject student are afraid they will not measur up and demand to be taught by the book teacher who know better than the book are intimid by student and administr from tri better approach good student are frustrat in their attempt to defin their own passion and to pursu it to their definit of success entrepreneur at the age of

pattern of teach and learn exact what the new pragmat embodi the abil to adapt and to be proactiv is counteract through the experi of test and the teach gear to multipl choic instrument the uncoupl of educ from the experienti frame of the human be is reflect in educ languag and organ and in the limit assumpt about it function and method educ has becom a self serv organ with a bureaucrat network of

longer period of time even in field of earli acknowledg creativ eg comput program network genet and nanotechnolog educ continu to appli a polici that take away the edg of youth invent and risk the lowest qualiti of educ is at the undergradu level in univers where either graduat assist or even machin substitut for professor too busi fund their research or actual no longer attun to teach this situat exist exact becaus we are not yet abl to develop strategi of educ adapt to new circumst of human work and to the effici requir which we ourselv made necessari the network of recurr convers to use winograd terminolog again or the languag game that wittgenstein attribut to each profess hide behind the front of literaci and thus burden educ onc accredit introduc the languag game of polit educ distanc itself even more from it fundament mission accredit agenc translat concern about the qualiti of educ into requir such as the evalu of colleg and univers base on score on exit test taken by student these are suppos to reflect academ achiev in other case such score are use for assess financi support the paradox is that what negat affect the qualiti of educ becom the measur of reward test result are often use in politician argument about improv educ as well as a market tool in fact to prepar student for perform make perform a goal in itself thus it should come as no surpris that the most popular book on colleg campus today educ factori is a guid to cheat mani time comparison are made between student in the usa and in japan or in western european countri in mani way these comparison are against the pervas dynam of integr that we experi still there are thing to consid for instanc that japanes student spend almost the same amount of time watch tv as american student do and that they are not involv in household task notic differ are in read the japanes spend doubl the number of hour that american student do in read japanes student spend more time on schoolwork the same 2 to 1 ratio but much less on entertain should japan be consid a model if we see that japanes student rank among the best in scienc subject the answer seem to be posit but if we project the same against the entir develop of student their except creativ achiev the answer becom a littl more guard with all it limit the usa is still more attun to pragmat requir this is probabl due more to the countri inher dynam than to it educ institut larg unregul capabl of adapt move subject to innov the usa is potenti a better network for educ possibl what caus the critic in these page of evalu is the indecis that the usa show the program for school reform for the year 2000 is an exampl of this attitud and the difficulti it has in realiz the price of the compromis it keep support onc japanes busi start buy american campus the price of the compromis becam clear univers in the usa were save from bankruptci japanes school whose structur program and lack of understand of the new pragmat made for headlin were abl to evad their own rigid system of educ reput for be late in acknowledg the dynam of chang abrupt the american of world educ studi driven by multipl choic test with a dualist structur was short chang by a japan movement but in the closer look suggest abov it is evid that the japanes are extric themselv from drastic literaci requir that end up hamper necessari accommod in the tradit

architectur and design chanc are that we shall not understand their particip in think and in other tradit non imag base form of human praxi imag are veri power agent for activ involv human emot and

by the metaphor of the global villag of teleconnect and tele view of internet and world wide web interact the characterist of imag given here so far need to be relat to the perspect of chang brought about by imag technolog otherwis we could hard come to understand how imag constitut languag that make literaci useless or better yet that result in the need for complementari partial literaci the mechan eye and the electron eye the photo camera and the associ technolog of photo process are product of the civil of literaci in anticip of the civil of illiteraci the metaphor of the eye manifest in the optic of the len and the mechan of the camera could not entir support new human percept of realiti without the particip of literaci camera use impli the share background of literaci and literaci base space represent the entir discuss of the possibl and limit of photographi a discuss begun short after the first photograph imag were produc and still go on in our day is an exercis in analyt practic some look at photographi as write with light other as mechan draw they doubt whether there was room for creativ in it use but never question it documentari qualiti shorthand for descript difficult but still possibl in write the wider the framework of practic experi involv the camera the more interest the testimoni of photographi prove this appli to photographi in journal and scienc as well as in person and famili life with photographi imag start to substitut for word and literaci progress gave way to imageri in a varieti of new human experi relat to space movement and

earli photograph of the pari sewer system the latter a subject of mani stori but liter out of sight exemplifi this function befor the camera onli draw could captur the visibl without chang it into word or obscur diagram draw was an interpret represent not onli in the sens of select what to draw but also in defin a perspect and endow the imag with some emot qualiti the camera had a long way to go befor the same interpret qualiti was achiev and even then in view of the mediat technolog it was quit difficult to defin what was ad to what was photograph and whi today camera from the dispos to the fulli autom encapsul everyth we have to know to oper them there is no need to be awar of the eye metaphor which is undergo chang with the advent of electron photographi and even less of what diaphragm exposur time and distanc are the experi lead to photographi and the practic experi of autom photographi are uncoupl to take a pictur is no longer a matter of expertis but a reflex gestur accompani travel famili or communiti event and discret moment of relat signific thus photograph imag took over linguist descript and becam our diari as confus as this might sound a camera turn into an extens of our eye actual onli one easier to use than languag and probabl more accur in some way a camera is a compress languag all set for the generat of visual sentenc if scientif use of photographi were not avail a great deal of effort would be necessari to verbal describ what imag from outer space from the power electron microscop or from under the earth and under water reveal to us in leonardo

for me this chang of emphasi correspond to a differ experi with the medium and is accompani by the liber of photographi from some of the constraint of the system of literaci what can i do concern photograph knowledg and the select made by photograph person who constitut their ident in a new practic experi what can it do refer to knowledg embodi in the hardwar the advertis succinct describ the

signific chang occur when photographi goe electron and in particular digit both element alreadi discuss the signific of the smallest chang in the input on the result and the qualiti aspect of digit vs

the object of literaci imag could not be use with the same eas as write and could not be transmit the way the voic is when we found way to have voic travel at speed faster than that of sound by electromagnet wave use in telephon or radio transmiss we consolid the function of languag but at the same time freed languag of some of the limit of literaci digit photographi accomplish the same for imag a written report from ani place in the world might take longer to produc though not to transmit than the imag repres the event report connect to a network an electron camera send imag from the

global and detail local interpret electron process of digit photographi support comparison as well as manipul of imag in view of unpreced human experi requir such function the metaphor of the one eye which the photograph camera embodi led to a flat world cyclop see everyth flat unfortun but by no accid this metaphor was taken over in comput graphic imag on the comput screen are held togeth by the convent of monocular vision digit photographi can be network and endow with dynam qualiti but what make digit photographi more and more a breakthrough in respect to it incipi liter phase is that we can build 3d camera that is technic beast with two eye and if need be with more this lead to practic experi in a pragmat framework no longer limit to sequenc or to reductionist strategi of represent who is afraid of a locomot the imag of a locomot move in the direct of the spectat made them scream and run away when move pictur were first shown to the public movement enhanc the realism of the imag

dialogu everyon was look forward to the day when imag and sound would be synchron when color movi would becom possibl it add to the argument thus far advanc that cinematograph human experi an experi domin visual reveal the role of languag as a synchron devic while the mechan of camera and projector took care of the optic illus cinematographi also suggest that this role could be exercis by other

whenev peopl use languag tri to convinc their partner in dialogu or even themselv that they understood a descript a concept a proof and answer by use the colloqui i see they actual express the practic

practic or intellectu purpos we expand the liter experi in new experi so it seem that we tend to visual everyth i would go so far as to say that we not onli visual everyth but also listen to sound of everyth experi their smell touch and tast and recreat the abstract in the concret of our percept the domin of languag and the ideal of literaci which instil this domin as a rule was and still is seen

that it would contribut to more than the mechan of number crunch the visionari dimens of the digit comput is not in the technolog but in the concept of a univers languag a characteristica universali or lingua adamica as leibniz conceiv it this is not the place to rewrit the histori of the comput or the histori of the languag that comput process but the subject of visual present here from the perspect of the shift from literaci to the visual requir at least some explan of the relat between the visual and the human use of comput the binari number system which leibniz call arithmetica binaria accord to a manuscript fragment date march 15 1679 was not meant to be the definit alphabet with onli two letter but the basi for a univers languag in which the limit of natur languag are overcom leibniz tri hard to make this languag utiliz in all domain of human activ in encod law scientif result music i think that the most intrigu aspect which has been ignor for centuri was his attempt to visual event of abstract natur with the help of the two symbol of his alphabet in a letter to herzog rudolph august von braunschweig januari 2 1697 leibniz describ his project for a medal depict the creation imago creationi in this letter he actual introduc digit calculus around 1714 he wrote two letter to nicola de remond concern chines philosophi it is use to mention these here becaus of the binari number represent of some of the most intrigu concept of the ih king through these letter we are in the realm of the visual and in front of page in which probabl for the first time translat from ideograph to the sequenti and final to the digit were perform it took almost 300 year befor hacker tri to see if they could use the digit for music notat discov that imag can be describ in a binari system this long histor parenthesi is justifi by two thought first it was not the technolog that made us awar of imag or even open access to their digit process but intellectu praxi motiv by it own need for effici second visual is not a matter of illustr word concept or intuit it is the attempt to creat tool for generat imag relat to inform and it use a text on a comput screen is in fact an imag a visual of the languag generat not by a human hand in control of a quill a piec of lead or graphit a pencil or a pen the comput doe not know languag it translat our alphabet into it own alphabet and then after process it translat it back into our display in those store imag which if in lead would constitut the content of the lower and upper case of the drawer in each typographi shop this literaci is subject to autom when we write we visual make our languag visibl on paper when we draw we make our plan for new artifact visibl the mediat introduc by the comput use doe not affect the condit of languag as long as the comput is onli the pen keyboard or typewrit but onc we encod languag rule such as spell case agreement and so on onc we store our vocabulari and our grammar and mimic human use of languag what is written is onli partial the result of the literaci of the writer the visual of text is the start point toward automat creation of other text it also lead to

prove whether this is a way of speak or a fact but the same can be said of languag that we can express thought sometim frustrat incomplet in languag doe not necessarili mean that we think in languag

literaci as a social encompass ideal state that peopl should be liter becaus peopl think in languag accord proper use of languag as set forth in the rule of literaci is a premis for success think besid introduc circular the premis turn out to be the conclus this is a strong assumpt with too mani implic for scienc and for philosophi to be left unchalleng the assumpt was never entir proven and

scientif research befor consid altern way to defin think and the relat between ration and human reason let us look at the characterist of think in current praxi scienc and philosophi includ the amount of languag we need to function in the workplac and in social life has diminish in comparison to previous circumst of human experi if think took place onli in languag that would mean that think itself has diminish veri few peopl would be inclin to accept this conclus the small subset of languag use in social life and in profession interact is repres of the segment natur of this life and of the

onli rare be acknowledg today if at all if this is the case which is difficult to prove what this seem to suggest is that the price paid for higher polit effici is the lost ethic of polit or it current deplor intellectu condit the lack of correl between polit practic and languag result from the pragmat context reflect in the condit of languag itself while in real life mani literaci are at

the question and ultim qualifi the answer war as practic experi war is a sheer continu of polit with other mean wrote carl von clausewitz on war 1818 it is difficult to argu against this but a paraphras intend to put the line in histor perspect might be appropri war is the continu of the practic experi of surviv in the context of a societi tri to control and adjud resourc accord combat follow the line of other practic experi the practic experi of hunt former combat with non human adversari requir the weapon eventu associ with war these were the tool that primit human use to wrest food for their surviv and the surviv of their communiti futur aspect of these activ and the associ moral valu make us sometim forget that the syncret natur of human be ie project of their natur endow in the practic act is express in the syncret of the tool use this syncret condit evolv under the need for labor divis and one of the main earli demand of labor divis result in the establish of the

forth a sequenc to be follow a logic to be use and a method for counteract enemi maneuv in order to achiev victori von clausewitz was the first to explicit point out that war continu polit while other writer on the subject live centuri befor he did perceiv war as a practic effort two byzantin emperor mauric 539 602 and leo call the wise 886 911 tri to formul militari strategi and tactic base on the
