reach me via e mail at adamgworldstdcom boston mass februari 1994 chapter 1 set up and jack in 11 readi set the world is just a phone call away with a comput and modem youll be abl to connect to the internet the world largest comput network and if your lucki you wont even need the modem mani colleg and compani now give their student or employe direct access to the internet the phone line can be your exist voic line just rememb that if you have ani extens you and everybodi els in the hous or offic wont be abl to use them for voic call while you are connect to the net a modem is a sort of translat between comput and the phone system it need becaus comput and the phone system process and transmit data or inform in two differ and incompat way comput talk digit that is they store and process inform as a seri of discret number the phone network reli on analog signal which on an oscilloscop would look like a seri of wave when your comput is readi to transmit data to anoth comput over a phone line your modem convert the comput number into these wave which sound like a lot of screech it modul them in turn when inform wave come into your modem it convert them into number your comput can process by demodul them increas comput come with modem alreadi instal if your didnt youll have to decid what speed modem to get modem speed are judg in bps rate or bit per second one bps mean the modem can transfer rough one bit per second the greater the bps rate the more quick a modem can send and receiv inform a letter or charact is made up of eight bit you can now buy a 2400 bps modem for well under 60 and most now come with the abil to handl fax messag as well at price that now start around 150 you can buy a modem that can transfer data at 14400 bps and often even faster use special compress techniqu if you think you might be use the net to transfer larg number of file a faster modem is alway worth the price it will dramat reduc the amount of time your modem or comput is tie up transfer file and if you are pay for net access by the hour will save you quit a bit in onlin charg like the comput to which it attach a modem is useless without softwar to tell it how to work most modem today come with easi to instal softwar tri the program out if you find it difficult to use or understand consid a trip to the local softwar store to find a better program you can spend sever hundr dollar on a communic program but unless you have veri special need this will be a wast of money as there are a host of excel program avail for around 100 or less among the basic featur you want to look for are a choic of differ protocol more on them in a bit for transfer file to and from the net and the abil to write script or command file that let you autom such step as log into a host system when you buy a modem and the softwar ask the dealer how to instal and use them tri out the softwar if you can if the dealer cant help you find anoth dealer youll not onli save yourself a lot of frustrat youll also have practic the prime internet direct ask peopl know to fulli take advantag of the net you must spend a few minut go over the manual or document that come with your softwar there are a few thing you should pay special attent to upload and download screen captur sometim call screen dump log how to chang protocol and termin emul it is also essenti to know how to convert a file creat with your word process program into ascii or text format which will let you share your thought with other across the net upload is the process of send a file from your comput to a system on the net download is retriev a file from somewher on the net to your comput in general thing in cyberspac go up to the net and come down to you chanc are your softwar will come with a choic of sever protocol to use for these transfer these protocol are system design to ensur that line nois or static doe not caus error that could ruin whatev inform you are tri to transfer essenti when use a protocol you are transfer a file in a seri of piec after each piec is sent or receiv your comput and the net system compar it if the two piec dont match exact they transfer it again until they agre that the inform they both have is ident if after sever tri the inform just doesnt make it across youll either get an error messag or your screen will freez in that case tri it again if after five tri you are still stymi someth is wrong with a the file b the telephon line c the system your connect to or d your own comput from time to time you will like see messag on the net that you want to save for later view a recip a particular witti remark someth you want to write your congressman about whatev this is where screen captur and log come in when you tell your communic softwar to captur a screen it open a file in your comput usual in the same directori or folder use by the softwar and dump an imag of whatev happen to be on your screen at the time log work a bit differ when you issu a log command you tell the softwar to open a file again usual in the same directori or folder as use by the softwar and then give it a name then until you turn off the log command everyth that scroll on your screen is copi into that file sort of like record on videotap this is use for captur long document that scroll for sever page use screen captur you would have to repeat the same command for each new screen termin emul is a way for your comput to mimic or emul the way other comput put inform on the screen and accept command from a keyboard in general most system on the net use a system call vt100 fortun almost all communic program now on the market support this system as well make sure your doe youll also have to know about protocol there are sever differ way for comput to transmit charact fortun there are onli two protocol that your like to run across 8 1 n which stand for 8 bit 1 stop bit no pariti yike and 7 1 e 7 bit 1 stop bit even pariti in general unix base system use 7 1 e while ms dos base system use 8 1 n what if you dont know what kind of system your connect to tri one of the set if you get what look like gobbledygook when you connect you may need the other set if so you can either chang the set while connect and then hit enter or hang up and tri again with the other set it also possibl your modem and the modem at the other end cant agre on the right bps rate if chang the protocol doesnt work tri use anoth bps rate but no faster than the one list for your modem dont worri rememb you cant break anyth if someth look wrong it probabl is wrong chang your set and tri again noth is learn without trial error and effort there are the basic now on to the net 12 go onc onli peopl who studi or work at an institut direct tie to the net could connect to the world today though an ever grow number of public access system provid access for everybodi these system can now be found in sever state and there are a coupl of site that can provid access across the countri there are two basic kind of these host system the more common one is known as a uucp site uucp be a common way to transfer inform among comput use the unix oper system and offer access to intern electron mail and confer howev recent year have seen the growth of more power site that let you tap into the full power of the net these internet site not onli give you access to electron mail and confer but to such servic as databas librari and huge file and program collect around the world they are also fast as soon as you finish write a messag it get zap out to it destin some site are run by for profit compani other by non profit organ some of these public access or host system are free of charg other charg a month or year fee for unlimit access and a few charg by the hour system that charg for access will usual let you sign up onlin with a credit card some also let you set up a bill system but cost should be onli one consider in choos a host system especi if you live in an area with more than one provid most system let you look around befor you sign up what is the rang of each of their servic how easi is each to use what kind of support or help can you get from the system administr the last two question are particular import becaus mani system provid no user interfac at all when you connect you are dump right into the unix oper system if your alreadi familiar with unix or you want to learn how to use it these system offer phenomen power in addit to net access most also let you tap into the power of unix to do everyth from compil your own program to play onlin game but if you dont want to have to learn unix there are other public access system that work through menus just like the one in restaur you are shown a list of choic and then you make your select of what you want or which provid a user interfac that is easier to figur out than the ever cryptic unix if you dont want or need access to the full rang of internet servic a uucp site make good financi sens they tend to charg less than commerci internet provid although their messag may not go out as quick some system also have their own uniqu local servic which can rang from extens confer to larg file librari 13 public access internet provid when you have your communic program dial one of these host system one of two thing will happen when you connect youll either see a lot of gibberish on your screen or youll be ask to log in if you see gibberish chanc are you have to chang your softwar paramet to 7 1 e or 8 1 n as the case may be hang up make the chang and then dial in again when youv connect chanc are youll see someth like this welcom to the world public access unix for the 90s login as new if you do not have an account login that last line is a prompt ask you to do someth sinc this is your first call type new and hit enter often when your ask to type someth by a host system youll be told what to type in quotat mark for exampl new dont includ the quotat mark repeat dont includ the quotat mark what you see next depend on the system but will general consist of inform about it cost and servic you might want to turn on your communic softwar log function to save this inform youll like be ask if you want to establish an account now or just look around the system youll also like be ask for your user name this is not your full name but a one word name you want to use while onlin it can be ani combin of letter or number all in lower case mani peopl use their first initi and last name for exampl jdoe their first name and the first letter of their last name for exampl johnd or their initi jxd other use a nicknam you might want to think about this for a second becaus this user name will becom part of your electron mail address see chapter 2 for more on that the one except are the various free net system all of which assign you a user name consist of an arbitrari sequenc of letter and number you are now on the net look around the system see if there are ani help file for you to read if it a menu base host system choos differ option just to see what happen rememb you cant break anyth the more you play the more comfort youll be what follow is a list of

the 1960s research began experi with link comput to each other and to peopl through telephon hook up use fund from the us defens depart advanc research project agenc arpa arpa want to see if comput in differ locat could be link use a new technolog known as packet switch this technolog in which data meant for anoth locat is broken up into littl piec each with it own forward address had the promis of let sever user share just one communic line just as import from arpa viewpoint was that this allow for creation of network that could automat rout data around down circuit or comput arpa goal was not the creation of today intern comput use communiti but develop of a data network that could surviv a nuclear attack previous comput network effort had requir a line between each comput on the network sort of like a one track train rout the packet system allow for creation of a data highway in which larg number of vehicl could essenti share the same lane each packet was given the comput equival of a map and a time stamp so that it could be sent to the right destin where it would then be reassembl into a messag the comput or a human could use this system allow comput to share data and the research to exchang electron mail or e mail in itself e mail was someth of a revolut offer the abil to send detail letter at the speed of a phone call as this system known as arpanet grew some enterpris colleg student and one in high school develop a way to use it to conduct onlin confer these start as scienc orient discuss but they soon branch out into virtual everi other field as peopl recogn the power of be abl to talk to hundr or even thousand of peopl around the countri in the 1970s arpa help support the develop of rule or protocol for transfer data between differ type of comput network these internet from internetwork protocol made it possibl to develop the worldwid net we have today that link all sort of comput across nation boundari by the close of the 1970s link develop between arpanet and counterpart in other countri the world was now tie togeth in a comput web in the 1980s this network of network which becam known collect as the internet expand at a phenomen rate hundr then thousand of colleg research compani and govern agenc began to connect their comput to this worldwid net some enterpris hobbyist and compani unwil to pay the high cost of internet access or unabl to meet stringent govern regul for access learn how to link their own system to the internet even if onli for e mail and confer some of these system began offer access to the public now anybodi with a comput and modem and persist could tap into the world in the 1990s the net continu to grow at exponenti rate some estim are that the volum of messag transfer through the net grow 20 percent a month in respons govern and other user have tri in recent year to expand the net itself onc the main net backbon in the us move data at 56000 bit per second that prove too slow for the ever increas amount of data be sent over it and in recent year the maximum speed was increas to 15 million and then 45 million bit per second even befor the net was abl to reach that latter speed howev net expert were alreadi figur out way to pump data at speed of up to 2 billion bit per second fast enough to send the entir encyclopedia britannica across the countri in just one or two second anoth major chang has been the develop of commerci servic that provid internetwork servic at speed compar to those of the govern system in fact by mid 1994 the us govern will remov itself from ani day to day control over the work of the net as region and nation provid continu to expand 16 how it work the worldwid net is actual a complex web of smaller region network to understand it pictur a modern road network of tran continent superhighway connect larg citi from these larg citi come smaller freeway and parkway to link togeth small town whose resid travel on slower narrow residenti way the net superhighway is the high speed internet connect to this are comput that use a particular system of transfer data at high speed in the us the major internet backbon theoret can move data at rate of 45 million bit per second compar this to the averag home modem which has a top speed of rough 9600 to 14400 bit per second connect to the backbon comput are smaller network serv particular geograph region which general move data at speed around 15 million bit per second feed off these in turn are even smaller network or individu comput unlik with commerci network such as compuserv or prodigi there is no one central comput or comput run the internet it resourc are to be found among thousand of individu comput this is both it greatest strength and it greatest weak the approach mean it is virtual imposs for the entir net to crash at onc even if one comput shut down the rest of the network stay up the design also reduc the cost for an individu or organ to get onto the network but thousand of connect comput can also make it difficult to navig the net and find what you want especi as differ comput may have differ command for plumb their resourc it is onli recent that net user have begun to develop the sort of navig tool and map that will let neophyt get around without get lost nobodi realli know how mani comput and network actual make up this net some estim say there are now as mani as 5000 network connect near 2 million comput and more than 15 million peopl around the world whatev the actual number howev it is clear they are onli increas the net is more than just a technolog marvel it is human communic at it most fundament level the pace may be a littl quicker when the messag race around the world in a few second but it not much differ from a larg and interest parti youll see thing in cyberspac that will make you laugh youll see thing that will anger you youll read silli littl snippet and new idea that make you think youll make new friend and meet peopl you wish would just go away major network provid continu to work on way to make it easier for user of one network to communic with those of anoth work is underway on a system for provid a univers white page in which you could look up somebodi electron mail address for exampl this connect trend will like speed up in come year as user begin to demand seamless network access much as telephon user can now dial almost anywher in the world without worri about how mani phone compani actual have to connect their call and today the link grow ever closer between the internet and such commerci network as compuserv and prodigi whose user can now exchang electron mail with their internet friend some commerci provid such as delphi and america onlin are work to bring their subscrib direct access to internet servic and as it becom easier to use more and more peopl will join this worldwid communiti we call the net be connect to the net take more than just read confer and log messag to your comput it take ask and answer question exchang opinion get involv if you choos to go forward to use and contribut you will becom a citizen of cyberspac if your read these word for the first time this may seem like an amus but unlik notion that one could inhabit a place without physic space but put a mark besid these word join the net and activ particip for a year then re read this passag it will no longer seem so strang to be a citizen of cyberspac it will seem like the most natur thing in the world and that lead to anoth fundament thing to rememb you cant break the net as you travel the net your comput may freez your screen may erupt into a mass of gibberish you may think youv just disabl a million dollar comput somewher or even your own person comput sooner or later this feel happen to everyon and like more than onc but the net and your comput are hardier than you think so relax you can no more break the net than you can the phone system if someth goe wrong tri again if noth at all happen you can alway disconnect if wors come to wors you can turn off your comput then take a deep breath and dial right back in leav a note for the person who run the comput to which youv connect to ask for advic tri it again persist pay stay and contribut the net will be richer for it and so will you 17 when thing go wrong your comput connect with a public access site and get gibberish on your screen if you are use paramet of 8 1 n tri 7 1 e or vice versa if that doesnt work tri anoth modem speed you have your comput dial a public access site but noth happen check the phone number you type in if correct turn on your modem speaker on hay compat modem you can usual do this by type atm1 in your communic softwar termin mode if the phone just ring and ring the public access site could be down for mainten or due to a crash or some other problem if you get a connect messag but noth els tri hit enter or escap a coupl of time you tri to log in but after you type your password noth happen or you get a time out messag follow by a disconnect re dial the number and tri it again alway rememb if you have a problem that just doesnt go away ask ask your system administr ask a friend but ask somebodi will know what to do 18 fyi the net grow so fast that even the best guid to it resourc would be somewhat outdat the day it was print at the end of each chapter howev youll find fyi pointer to place on the net where you can go for more inform or to keep updat on new resourc and servic peter kaminski maintain a list of system that provid public access to internet servic it availbl on the network itself which obvious doe you littl good if you current have no access but which can prove invalu should you move or want to find a new system look for his pdial file in the altbbslist or newsansw newsgroup in usenet for inform on access usenet see chapter 3 steven levi book hacker hero of the comput revolut anchor press/doubleday 1984 describ the earli cultur and etho that ultim result in the internet and usenet john quarterman the matrix comput network and conferenc system worldwid digit press 1990 is an exhaust look at comput network and how they connect with each other youll find numer document about the internet it histori and it resourc in the pub/net info directori on the electron frontier foundat ftp server see chapter 7 to deciph this chapter 2 e mail 21 the basic electron mail or e mail is your person connect to the world of the net all of the million of peopl around the world who use the net have their own e mail address a grow number of gateway tie more and more peopl to the net everi day when you log onto the host system you are now use it automat generat an address for you as well the basic concept behind e mail parallel those of regular mail you send mail to peopl at their particular address in turn they write to you at your e mail address you can subscrib to the electron equival of magazin and newspap you might even get electron junk mail e mail has two distinct advantag over regular mail the most obvious is speed instead of sever day your messag can reach the other side of the world in hour minut or even second depend on where you drop off your mail and the state of the connect between there and your recipi the other advantag is that onc you master the basic youll be abl to use e mail to access databas and file librari youll see how to do this later along with learn how to transfer program and data file through e mail e mail also has advantag over the telephon you send your messag when it conveni for you your recipi respond at their conveni no more telephon tag and while a phone call across the countri or around the world can quick result in huge phone bill e mail let you exchang vast amount of mail for onli a few penni even if the other person is in new zealand e mail is your connect to help your net lifelin the net can sometim seem a frustrat place no matter how hard you tri no matter where you look you just might not be abl to find the answer to whatev is caus you problem but when you know how to use e mail help is often just a few keystrok away you can ask your system administr or a friend for help in an e mail messag the quickest way to start learn e mail is to send yourself a messag most public access site actual have sever differ type of mail system all of which let you both send and receiv mail well start with the simplest one known appropri enough as mail and then look at a coupl of other interfac at your host system command prompt type mail usernam where usernam is the name you gave yourself when you first log on hit enter the comput might respond with subject type test or actual anyth at all but youll have to hit enter befor you get to the end of the screen hit enter the cursor will drop down a line you can now begin write the actual messag type a sentenc again anyth at all and here where you hit your first unix frustrat one that will bug you repeat you have to hit enter befor you get to the veri end of the line just like typewrit mani unix program have no word wrap although there are way to get some unix text processor such as emac to word wrap when done with your messag hit return now hit control d the control and the d key at the same time this is a unix command that tell the comput your done write and that it should close your envelop and mail it off you could also hit enter onc and then on a blank line type a period at the begin of the line and hit enter again youv just sent your first e mail messag and becaus your send mail to yourself rather than to someon somewher els on the net your messag has alreadi arriv as well see in a moment if you had want you could have even written your messag on your own comput and then upload it into this electron envelop there are a coupl of good reason to do this with long or involv messag one is that onc you hit enter at the end of a line in mail you cant readili fix ani mistak on that line unless you use some special command to call up a unix text processor also if you are pay for access by the hour upload a prepar messag can save you money rememb to save the document in ascii or text format upload a document youv creat in a word processor that use special format command which these day mean mani program will caus strang effect when you get that blank line after the subject line upload the messag use the ascii protocol or you can copi and past the text if your softwar allow that when done hit control d as abov now you have mail wait for you normal when you log on your public access site will tell you whether you have new mail wait to open your mailbox and see your wait mail type mail and hit enter when the host system see mail without a name after it it know you want to look in your mailbox rather than send a messag your screen on a plain vanilla unix system will display mail version smi 40 mon apr 24 183415 pdt 1989 type for help /usr/spool/mail/adamg 1 messag 1 new 1 unread >n 1 adamg sat jan 15 2004 12/290 test ignor the first line it just computeres of valu onli to the peopl who run your system you can type a question mark and hit return but unless your familiar with unix most of what youll see wont make much sens at this point the second line tell you the directori on the host system where your mail messag are put which again is not someth youll like need to know the second line also tell you how mani messag are in your mailbox how mani have come in sinc the last time you look and how mani messag you havent read yet it the third line that is of real interest it tell you who the messag is from when it arriv how mani line and charact it take up and what the subject is the n mean it is a new messag it arriv after the last time you look in your mailbox hit enter and there your messag onli now it a lot longer than what you wrote messag 1 from adamg jan 15 200455 1994 receiv by efforg id aa28949 565c/ida 144/pen ident for adamg sat 15 jan 1994 200455 0400 ident sender adamgefforg date sat 15 jan 1994 213455 0400 from adam gaffin <adamg> messag id <199204270134aa28949efforg> to adamg subject test status r this is onli a test whoa what is all that stuff it your messag with a postmark gone mad just as the postal servic put it mark on everi piec of mail it handl so do net postal system onli it call a header instead of a postmark each system that handl or rout your mail put it stamp on it sinc mani messag go through a number of system on their way to you you will often get messag with header that seem to go on forev among other thing a header will tell you exact when a messag was sent and receiv even the differ between your local time and greenwich mean time as at the end of line 4 abov if this had been a long messag it would just keep scroll across and down your screen unless the peopl who run your public access site have set it up to paus everi 24 line one way to deal with a messag that doesnt stop is to use your telecommun softwar log or text buffer function start it befor you hit the number of the messag you want to see your comput will ask you what you want to call the file your about to creat after you name the file and hit enter type the number of the messag you want to see and hit enter when the messag finish scroll turn off the text buffer function the messag is now save in your comput this way you can read the messag while not connect to the net which can save you money if your pay by the hour and write a repli offlin but in the meantim now what you can respond to the messag delet it or save it to respond type a lowercas r and hit enter youll get someth like this to adamg subject re test note that this time you dont have to enter a user name the comput take it from the messag your repli to and automat address your messag to it sender the comput also automat insert a subject line by ad re to the origin subject from here it just like write a new messag but say you chang your mind and decid not to repli after all how do you get out of the messag hit control c onc youll get this interrupt one more to kill letter if you hit control c onc more the messag will disappear and youll get back to your mail command line now if you type a lowercas d and then hit enter youll delet the origin messag type a lowercas q to exit your mailbox if you type a q without first hit d your messag is transfer to a file call mbox this file is where all read but un delet messag go if you want to leav it in your mailbox for now type a lowercas x and hit enter this get you out of mail without make ani chang the mbox file work a lot like your mailbox to access it type mail f mbox at your host system command line and hit enter youll get a menu ident to the one in your mailbox from which you can read these old messag delet them or respond to them it probabl a good idea to clear out your mailbox and mbox file from time to time if onli to keep them unclutt are there ani drawback to e mail there are a few one is that peopl seem more will to fli off the handl electron than in person or over the phone mayb it becaus it so easi to hit r and repli to a messag without paus and reflect a moment that whi we have smiley see section 24 there no onlin equival yet of a return receipt chanc are your messag got to where it go but there no absolut way for you to know for sure unless you get a repli from the other person so now your readi to send e mail to other peopl on the net of cours you need somebodi address to send them mail how do you get it ala the simplest answer is not what youd call the most eleg you call them up on the phone or write them a letter on paper and ask them resid of the electron frontier are onli begin to develop the equival of phone book and the one that exist today are far from complet still later on in chapter 6 well show you how to use some of these directori eventu youll start correspond with peopl which mean youll want to know how to address mail to them it vital to know how to do this becaus the smallest mistak use a comma when you should have use a period for instanc can bounc the messag back to you undeliv in this sens net address are like phone number one wrong digit and you get the wrong person fortun most net address now adher to a relat easi to understand system earlier you sent yourself a mail messag use just your user name this was sort of like make a local phone call you didnt have to dial a 1 or an area code this also work for mail to anybodi els who has an account on the same system as you send mail outsid of your system though will requir the use of the net equival of area code call domain a basic net address will look someth like this tomgworldstdcom tomg is somebodi user id and he is at henc the sign a site or in internetes a domain known as stdcom larg organ often have more than one comput link to the internet in this case the name of the particular machin is world you will quick notic that like boat owner internet comput owner alway name their machin domain tell you the name of the organ that run a given e mail site and what kind of site it is or if it not in the us what countri it locat in larg organ may have more than one comput or gateway tie to the internet so youll often see a two part domain name and sometim even three or four part domain name in general american address end in an organiz suffix such as edu which mean the site is at a colleg or univers other american suffix includ com for busi org for non profit organ gov and mil for govern and militari agenc net for compani or organ that run larg network site in the rest of the world tend to use a two letter code that repres their countri most make sens such as ca for canadian site but there are a coupl of seem odd one swiss site end in ch while south african one end in za some us site have follow this intern convent such as wellsfcaus youll notic that the abov address are all in lower case unlik almost everyth els have anyth at all to do with unix most net mail system dont care about case so you general dont have to worri about capit e mail address ala there are a few except some public access site do allow for capit letter in user name when in doubt ask the person you want to write to or let her send you a messag first recal how a person e mail address is usual found on the top of her messag the domain name the part of the address after the sign never has to be capit it all a fair simpl system that work veri well except again it vital to get the address exact right just as you have to dial a phone number exact right send a messag to tomgunmedu which is the univers of new mexico when you meant to send it to tomgumnedu the univers of minnesota and your letter will either bounc back to you undeliv or go to the wrong person if your messag is bounc back to you as undeliver youll get an omin look messag from mailer daemon actual a rather benign unix program that exist to handl mail with an evil look header follow by the text of your messag sometim you can tell what went wrong by look at the first few line of the bounc messag besid an incorrect address it possibl your host system doe not have the other site in the map it maintain of other host system or you could be tri to send mail to anoth network such as bitnet or compuserv that has special address requir sometim figur all this out can prove high frustrat but rememb the prime net command ask send a messag to your system administr he or she might be abl to help deciph the problem there is one kind of address that may give your host system particular problem there are two main way that unix system exchang mail one is known as uucp and start out with a differ address system than the rest of the net most uucp system have sinc switch over to the standard net address system but a few tradit site still cling to their origin type which tend to have lot of exclam point in it like this uunetsomesiteothersitemybuddi the problem for mani host site is that exclam point also known as bang now mean someth special in the more common system or shell use to oper mani unix comput this mean that address mail to such a site or even respond to a messag you receiv from one could confus the poor comput to no end and your messag never get sent out if that happen tri put backslash in front of each exclam point so that you get an address that look like this uunet\somesite\othersite\mybuddi note that this mean you may not be abl to respond to such a messag by type a lowercas r you may get an error messag and youll have to creat a brand new messag if you want to get a tast of what possibl through e mail start an e mail messag to almanacoesorstedu leav the subject line blank as a messag write this send quot or if your feel a littl down write this instead send moral support in either case you will get back a messag within a few second to a few hour depend on the state of your host system internet connect if you simpli ask for a quot youll get back a fortun cooki like say if you ask for moral support youll also get back a fortun cooki like say onli suppos more uplift this particular mail server is run by oregon state univers it main purpos is actual to provid a way to

ani messag youv read but havent mark for delet to a receiv file for now hit your n key elm has a major disadvantag for the beginn the default text editor it general call up when you hit your r or m key is often a program call emac unixoid swear by emac but everybodi els almost alway find it imposs unfortun you cant alway get away from it or vi anoth text editor often found on unix system so later on well talk about some basic command that will keep you from go total nut if you want to save a messag to your own comput hit s either within the messag or with your cursor on the messag entri in the elm menu a filenam will pop up if you do not like it type a new name you wont have to backspac hit enter and the messag will be save with that file name in your home directori on your host

improv that make it an ideal mail system for beginn like elm pine start you with a menu it also has an address book featur that is handi for peopl with long or complex e mail address hit a at the main menu put you in the address book where you can type in the person first name or nicknam follow by her address then when you want to send that person a messag you onli have to type in her first name or nicknam and pine automat insert her actual address the address book also let you set up a mail list this featur allow you to send the same messag to a number of peopl at onc what realli set pine apart is it built in text editor which look and feel a lot more like word process program avail for ms dos and macintosh user not onli doe it have word wrap a revolutionari concept if ever there was one it also has a spell checker and a search command best of all all of the command you need are list in a two line mini menu at the bottom of each screen the command look like this w where is the littl caret is a synonym for the key mark control on your keyboard to find where a particular word is in your document youd hit your control key and your w key at the same time which would bring up a prompt ask you for the word to look for some of pine command are a tad peculiar control v for page down for exampl which come from be base on a variant of emac which is utter peculiar but again all of the command you need are list on that two line mini menu so it shouldnt take you more than a coupl of second to find the right one to use pine type pine at the command line and hit enter it a relat new program so some system may not yet have it onlin but it so easi to use you should probabl send e mail to your system administr urg him to get it 24 smiley when your involv in an onlin discuss you cant

mail to other network there are a number of comput network that are not direct part of the net but which are now connect through gateway that allow the pass of e mail here a list of some of the larger network how to send mail to them and how their user can send mail to you america onlin remov ani space from a user name and append aolcom to get useraolcom america onlin user who want to send mail to you need onli put your net address in the to field befor compos a messag attmail address your messag to userattmailcom from attmail a user would send mail to you in this form internetdomainus so if your address were nancyrworldstdcom your correspond would send a messag to you at internetworldstdcomnancyr bitnet user of bitnet and netnorth in canada and earn in europ often have address in this form izzyindvm if your lucki all youll have to do to mail to that address is add bitnet at the end to get izzyindvmsbitnet sometim howev mail to such an address will bounc back to you becaus bitnet address do not alway translat well into an internet form if this happen you can send mail through one of two internet/bitnet gateway first chang the in the address to a so that you get usernamesitebitnet then add either vmmaristedu or cunyvmcunyedu so that with the abov exampl you would get izzyindyvmsbitnetvmmaristedu or izzyindvyvmsbitnetcunyvmcunyedu bitnet user have it a littl easier they can usual send mail direct to your e mail address without fool around with it at all so send them your address and they should be ok compuserv compuserv user have numer address in this form 73727545 to send mail to a compuserv user chang the comma to a period and add compuservecom for exampl 73727545compuservecom note that some compuserv user must pay extra to receiv mail from the internet if you know compuserv user who want to send you mail tell them to go mail and creat a mail messag in the address area instead of type in a compuserv number have them type your address in this form >internetyouridyouraddress for exampl >internetadamgworldstdcom note that both the > and the are requir delphi to send mail to a delphi user the form is usernamedelphicom fidonet to send mail to peopl use a fidonet bbs you need the name they use to log onto that system and it node number fidonet node number or address consist of three number in this form 1322/190 the first number tell which of sever broad geograph zone the bbs is in 1 repres the us and canada 2 europ and israel 3 pacif asia 4 south america the second number repres the bbss network while the final number is the bbss fidonod number in that network if your correspond onli give you two number for exampl 322/190 it mean the system is in zone 1 now come the tricki part you have to revers the number and add to them the letter f n and z which stand for fidonodenetwork and zone for exampl the address abov would becom f190n322z1 now add fidonetorg at the end to get f190n322z1fidonetorg then add firstnamelastnam to get firstnamelastnamef190n322z1fidonetorg note the period between the first and last name also some countri now have their own fidonet backbon system which might affect address for exampl were the abov address in germani you would end it with fidod instead of fidonetorg whew the revers process is total differ first the person has to have access to his or her bbss net mail area and know the fidonet address of his or her local fidonet/uucp gateway often their system oper will know it your fidonet correspond should address a net mail messag to uucp not your name in the to field in the node number field they should type in the node number of the fidonet/uucp gateway if the gateway system is in the same region network as their system they need onli type the last number for exampl 390 instead of 322/390 then the first line of the messag has to be your internet address follow by a blank line after that the person can write the messag and send it becaus of the way fidonet move mail it could take a day or two for a messag to be deliv in either direct also becaus mani fidonet system are run as hobbi it is consid good form to ask the gateway sysop permiss if you intend to pass larg amount of mail back and forth messag of a commerci natur are strict forbidden even if it someth the other person ask for also consid it veri like that somebodi other than the recipi will read your messag geni to send mail to a geni user add geniecom to the end of the geni user name for exampl waltgeniecom mcimail to send mail to somebodi with an mcimail account add mcimailcom to the end of their name or numer address for exampl 555 1212mcimailcom or jsmithmcimailcom note that if there is more than one mcimail subscrib with that name you will get a mail messag back from mci give you their name and numer address youll then have to figur out which one you want and re send the messag from mci a user would type your name em at the to prompt at the em prompt he or she would type internet follow by your net address at the mbx prompt peacenet to send mail to a peacenet user use this form usernameigcorg peacenet subscrib can use your regular address to send you mail prodigi useridprodigycom note that prodigi user must pay extra for internet e mail 26 seven unix command you cant live without if you connect to the net through a unix system eventu youll have to come to term with unix for better or wors most unix system do not shield you from their inner work if you want to copi a usenet post to a file for exampl youll have to use some unix command if you ever want to do anyth with that file like ms dos unix is an oper system it tell the comput how to do thing now while unix may have a reput as be even more complex than ms dos in most case a few basic and simpl command should be all youll ever need if your own comput use ms dos or pc dos the basic concept will seem veri familiar but watch out for the cd command which work differ enough from the similar name dos command that it will drive you crazi also unlik ms dos unix is case sensit if you type command or directori name in the wrong case youll get an error messag if your use to work on a mac youll have to rememb that unix store file in directori rather than folder unix directori are organ like branch on a tree at the bottom is the root directori with sub directori branch off that and sub directori in turn can have sub directori the mac equival of a unix sub directori is a folder within anoth folder cat equival to the ms dos type command to paus a file everi screen type cat file more where file is the name of the file you want to see hit control c will stop the display altern you could type more file to achiev the same result you can also use cat for write or upload text file to your name or home directori similar to the ms dos copi con command if you type cat>test you start a file call test you can either write someth simpl no edit onc youv finish a line and you have to hit return at the end of each line or upload someth into that file use your communic softwar ascii protocol to close the file hit control d cd the chang directori command to chang from your present directori to anoth type cd directori and hit enter unlik ms dos which use a \ to denot sub directori for exampl \stuff\text unix use a / for exampl /stuff/text so to chang from your present directori to the stuff/text sub directori you would type cd stuff/text and then hit enter as in ms dos you do not need the first backslash if the subdirectori come off the directori your alreadi in to move back up a directori tree you would type cd follow by enter note the space between the cd and the two period this is where ms dos user will realli go nut cp copi a file the syntax is cp file1 file2 which would copi file1 to file2 or overwrit file2 with file1 ls this command when follow by enter tell you what in the directori similar to the dos dir command except in alphabet order ls more will stop the list everi 24 line handi if there are a lot of thing in the directori the basic ls command doe not list hidden file such as the login file that control how your system interact with unix to see these file type ls a or ls a more ls l will tell you the size of each file in byte and tell you when each was creat or modifi mv similar to the ms dos renam command mv file1 file2 will renam file1 as file2 the command can also be use to move file between directori mv file1 news would move file1 to your news directori rm delet a file type rm filenam and hit enter but bewar when you hit enter it gone for good wildcard when search for copi or delet file you can use wildcard if you are not sure of the file exact name ls man would find the follow file manual manualtxt man o man use a question mark when your sure about all but one or two charact for exampl ls man would find a file call mane but not one call manual 27 when thing go wrong you send a messag but get back an omin look messag from mailer daemon contain up to sever dozen line of computeres follow by your messag somewher in those line you can often find a clue to what went wrong you might have made a mistak in spell the e mail address the site to which your send mail might have been down for mainten or a problem you may have use the wrong translat for mail to a non internet network you call up your host system text editor to write a messag or repli to one and cant seem to get out if it emac tri control x control c in other word hit your control key and your x key at the same time follow by control and c if wors come to wors you can hang up in elm you accident hit the d key for a messag you want to save type the number of the messag hit enter and then u which will un delet the messag this work onli befor you exit elm onc you quit the messag is gone you tri to upload an ascii messag youv written on your own comput into a messag your prepar in elm or pine and you get a lot of left bracket capit ms ks and ls and some funni look charact believ it or not your messag will actual wind up look fine all that garbag is temporari and reflect the problem some unix text processor have with ascii upload but it will take much longer for your upload to finish one way to deal with this is to call up the simpl mail program which will not produc ani weird charact when you upload a text file into a messag anoth way which is better if your prepar messag is a respons to somebodi mail is to creat a text file on your host system with cat for exampl cat>fil and then upload your text into that then in elm or pine you can insert the messag with a simpl command control r in pine for exampl onli this time you wont see all that extran stuff you havent clear out your elm mailbox in awhil and you accident hit y when you meant to hit n or vice versa when exit and now all your messag have disappear look in your news directori at the command line type cd news for a file call reciev those are all your messag unfortun there no way to get them back into your elm mailbox youll have to download the file or read it onlin chapter 3 usenet i 31 the global water hole imagin a convers carri out over a period of hour and day as if peopl were

spafford the first thing to understand about usenet is that it is wide misunderstood everi day on usenet the blind men and the eleph phenomenon is evid in spade in my opinion more flame war aris becaus of a lack of understand of the natur of usenet than from ani other sourc and consid that such flame war aris of necess among peopl who are on usenet imagin then how poor understood usenet must be by those outsid more7 this time the header look much more like the gobbledygook you get in e mail messag to keep read hit your space bar if you hit your n key lower case youll go to the next messag in the numer order to escap rn just keep hit your q key in lower case until you get back to the command line now let set up your read list becaus rn use the same newsrc file as nn you can use one of the search and replac method describ abov or you can do this type rn and hit enter when the first newsgroup come up on your screen hit your u key in lower case hit it again and again and again or just keep it press down if your comput start beep let up for a coupl of second eventu youll be told your at the end of the newsgroup and ask what you want to do next here where you begin enter newsgroup

command type l mac follow by enter will bring up a list of newsgroup with those letter in them and as in nn you will also see group deal with emac and the like in addit to group relat to macintosh comput becaus of the vast amount of messag transmit over usenet most system carri messag for onli a few day or week so if there a messag you want to keep you should either turn on your comput screen captur or save it to a file which you can later download to save a messag as a file in rn type s filenam where filenam is what you want to call the file hit enter youll be ask if you want to save it in mailbox format in most case you can answer with an n which will strip off the header the messag will now be save to a file in your news directori which you can access by type cd news and then hit enter also some newsgroup fill up particular quick go away for a coupl of day and youll come back to find hundr of articl one way to deal with that is to mark them as read so that they no longer

altinfosystemsannounc peopl ad new inform servic to the internet will post detail here 37 speak up thread are an integr part of usenet when somebodi post a messag often somebodi els will respond soon a thread of convers begin follow these thread is relat easi in nn relat messag are group togeth in rn when your done with a messag you can hit control n to read the next relat messag or followup as you explor usenet it probabl a good idea to read discuss for awhil befor you jump in this way you can get a feel for the particular newsgroup each has it own rhythm eventu though youll want to speak up there are two main way to do this you join an exist convers or you can start a whole new thread if you want to join a discuss you have to decid if you want to includ portion of the messag you are respond to in your messag the reason to do this is so peopl can see what your respond to just in case the origin messag has disappear from their system rememb that most usenet messag have a short life span on the averag host system or they cant find it if your use a unix host system join an exist convers is similar in both nn and rn hit your f key when done with a given articl in the thread in rn type a small f if you dont want to includ portion of the messag your respond to an uppercas f if you do in nn type a capit f youll then be ask if you want to includ portion of the origin messag and here where you hit anoth unix wall when you hit your f key your host system call up it basic unix text editor if your lucki thatll be pico a veri easi system more like howev youll get dump into emac or possibl vi which youv alreadi met in the chapter on e mail the singl most import emac command is control x control c this mean depress your control key and hit x then depress the control key and hit c memor this in fact it so import it bear repeat control x control c these keystrok are how you get out of emac if they work well youll be ask if you want to send edit abort or list the messag you were work on if they dont work well say you accident hit some other weird key combin that mean someth special to emac and noth seem to happen or you just get more weird look emac prompt on the bottom of your screen tri hit control g this should stop whatev emac was tri to do you should see the word quit on the bottom of your screen after which you can hit control x control c but if this still doesnt work rememb that you can alway disconnect and dial back in if you have told your newsread you do want to includ portion of the origin messag in your it will automat put the entir thing at the top of your messag use the arrow key to move down to the line you want to delet and hit control k which will delet one line at a time you can then write your messag rememb that you have to hit enter befor your cursor get to the end of the line becaus emac doe not have word wrap when done hit control x control c youll be ask the question about send edit abort etc choos one if you hit y your host system will start the process to send your messag across the net the nn and rn program work differ when it come to post entir new messag in nn type post and hit enter in ani newsgroup youll be ask which newsgroup to post a messag to type in it name and hit enter then youll be ask for keyword these are word youd use to attract somebodi scan a newsgroup say your sell your car you might type the type of car here next come a summari line which is somewhat similar final youll be ask for the messag distribut this is where you put how wide you want your messag dissemin think about this one for a second if you are sell your car it make littl sens to send a messag about it all over the world but if you want to talk about the environ it might make a lot of sens each host system has it own set of distribut classif but there general a local one just for user of that system one for the citi state or region it in anoth for the countri for exampl usa one for the contin for american and canadian na and final one for the entir world usual world which one to use general a coupl of second thought will help you decid if your sell your car use your citi or region distribut peopl in australia wont much care and may even get annoy if you want to discuss presidenti polit use a usa distribut make more sens if you want to talk about event in the middl east send your messag to the entir world is perfect accept then you can type your messag if youv compos your messag offlin general a good idea if you and emac dont get along you can upload it now you may see a lot of weird look charact as it upload into emac but those will disappear when you hit control x and then control c altern save the messag for exampl by hit m in rn log out compos your messag offlin log back on and upload your messag into a file on your host system then call up usenet find the articl you save start a repli and youll be ask if you want to includ a prepar messag type in the name of the file you just creat and hit enter in rn you have to wait until you get to the end of a newsgroup to hit f which will bring up a messag compos system altern at your host system command line you can type pnew and hit enter youll be prompt somewhat similar to the nn system except that youll be given a list of possibl distribut if you chose world youll get this messag this program post news to thousand of machin throughout the entir civil world your messag will cost the net hundr if not thousand of dollar to send everywher pleas be sure you know what you are do are you absolut sure that you want to do this ny dont worri your messag wont realli cost the net untold amount although again it a good idea to think for a second whether your messag realli should go everywher if you want to respond to a given post through e mail instead of public hit r in nn or r or r in rn in rn as with follow up articl the upper case key includ the origin messag in your most newsgroup are unmoder which mean that everi messag you post will eventu wind up on everi host system within the geograph region you specifi that carri that newsgroup some newsgroup howev are moder as you saw earlier with comprisk in these group messag are ship to a singl locat where a moder act much like a magazin editor decid what actual get post in some case group are moder like scholar journal in other case it to tri to cut down on the massiv number of messag that might otherwis be post youll notic that mani articl in usenet end with a fanci signatur that often contain some witti say a clever draw and almost incident the poster name and e mail address you too can have your own signatur automat append to everyth you post on your own comput creat a signatur file tri to keep it to four line or less lest you annoy other on the net then while connect to your host system type cat>signatur and hit enter note the period befor the s upload your signatur file into this use your communic softwar ascii upload protocol when done hit control d the unix command for close a file now everi time you post a messag this will be append to it there are a few caveat to post usenet is no differ from a town meet or public your not suppos to break

you think should be discuss in more than one usenet newsgroup rather than post individu messag in each group you can post the same messag in sever group at onc through a process known as cross post say you want to start a discuss about the polit ramif of import rare tropic fish from brazil peopl who read recaquaria might have someth to say so might peopl who read altpoliticsanim and talkpoliticsmisc cross post is easi it also should mean that peopl on other system who subscrib to sever newsgroup will see your messag onli onc rather than sever time news read softwar can cancel out the other copi onc a person has read the messag when you get readi to post a messag whether through pnew for rn or the post command in nn youll be ask in which newsgroup type the name of the various group separ by a comma but no space for exampl recaquariaaltpoliticsanimalstalkpoliticsmisc and hit enter after answer the other question geograph distribut etc the messag will be post in the various group unless one of the group is moder in which case the messag goe to the moder who decid whether to make it public it consid bad form to post to an excess number of newsgroup or inappropri newsgroup probabl you dont realli have to post someth in 20 differ place and while you may think your particular polit issu is vital import to the fate of the world chanc are the reader of recartscom will not

sometim they go on for year in which case they becom holi war usual on such topic as the relat merit of macintosh and ibm often just when theyr die down somebodi new to the flame war read all the messag get upset and issu an urgent plea that the flame war be taken to e mail so everybodi els can get back to whatev the newsgroup busi is all this usual doe though is start a brand new flame war in which this poor person come under attack for dare to question the first amend prompt other to jump on the attack for impugn this poor soul you get the idea everi so often a discuss get so out of hand that somebodi predict that either the govern will catch on and shut the whole thing down or somebodi will sue to close down the network or mayb even the wrath of god will smote everybodi involv this bring what has becom an inevit rejoind from other who realiz that the network is in fact a resili creatur that will not die easili immin death of usenet predict film at 11 flame war can be tremend fun to watch at first they quick grow bore though and wait until the first time your attack flamer are not the onli netcharact to watch out for spewer assum that whatev they are particular concern about

the same subject and the number of newsgroup to which he then send these articl both can reach well into doubl digit often these messag relat to various ethnic conflict around the world frequent there is no conceiv connect between the issu at hand and most of the newsgroup to which he post no matter if you tri to point this out in a respons to one of these messag you will be inund with angri messag that either accus you of be an insensit racist/american/whatev or ignor your point entir to bring up sever hundr more line of commentari on the perfidi of whoever it is the spewer think is out to

the usenet wizard there get cranki sometim when they have to answer the same question over and over again oh theyll eventu answer your question but not befor they tell you should have ask your host system administr first or look at the post in newsannouncenewus 42 killfil the cure for what ail you as you keep read usenet you are go to run across thing or peopl that realli drive you nut or that you just get tire of see killfil are just the thing for you when you start your newsread it check to see if you have ani list of word phrase or name you dont want to see if you do then it blank out ani messag contain those word such as cascad as you saw earlier when you post a repli to a messag and includ part of that messag the origin line show up with a > in front of them well what if you repli to a repli then you get a >> in front of the line and if you repli to that repli you get >>> keep this up and soon you get a triangl of >s build up in your messag there are peopl who like build up these triangl or cascad theyll respond to your messag by delet everyth youv said leav onli the in messag 123435 you said part and the last line of your messag to which they add a nonsens retort on and on they go until the triangl has reach the right end of the page then they tri to expand the triangl by delet one > with each new line whoever get to finish this mega triangl win there is even a newsgroup just for such folk altcascad unfortun cascad would general rather cascad in other newsgroup becaus it take a lot of messag to build up a complet cascad the target newsgroup soon fill up with these messag of cours if you complain youll be bombard with messag about the first amend and artist express or wors with anoth cascad the onli thing you can do is ignor them by set up a killfil there are also certain newsgroup where killfil will come in handi becaus of the way the newsgroup are organ for exampl reader of recartstvsoap alway use an acronym in their subject line for the show theyr write about amc for exampl for all my children this way peopl who onli want to read about one life to live can blank out all the messag about the young and the restless and all the other to keep peopl from accident screen out messag that might contain the letter gh in them general hospit viewer alway use gh in their subject line both nn and rn let you creat killfil but in differ way to creat a killfil in nn go into the newsgroup with the offend messag and type a capit k youll see this at the bottom of your screen auto kill or select cr => kill subject 30 day if you hit return nn will ask you which articl subject your tire of choos one and the articl and ani follow up will disappear and you wont see them again for 30 day if you type a lower case k instead youll get this auto kill on subject or name s if you hit your s key or just enter youll see this kill subject =/ type in the name of the offend word or phrase and hit enter youll then be prompt kill in group efftest or in all group g except that the name of the group you see will be the one your actual in at the moment becaus cascad and other annoy peopl often cross post their messag to a wide rang of newsgroup you might consid hit a instead of g next come lifetim of entri in day perman 30 the p key will screen out the offend articl forev while hit enter will do it for 30 day you can also type in a number of day for the block creat killfil in rn work differ it default killfil generat onli work for messag in specif group rather than global for your entir newsgroup list to creat a global killfil youll have to write one yourself to creat a killfil in rn go into the newsgroup where the offend messag are and type in it number so you get it on your screen type a capit k from now on ani messag with that subject line will disappear befor you read the group you should probabl choos a repli rather than the origin messag so that you will get all of the followup the origin messag wont have a re in it subject line the next time you call up that newsgroup rn will tell you it kill messag when it done hit the space bar to go back into read mode to creat a global kill file that will automat wipe out articl in all group you read start rn and type control k this will start your whatev text editor you have as your default on your host system and creat a file call kill in your news subdirectori on the first line youll type in the word phrase or name you dont want to see follow by command that tell rn whether to search an entir messag for the word or name and then what to do when it find it each line must be in this form /pattern/modifierj pattern is the word or phrase you want rn to look for it case insensit both test and test will be knock out the modifi tell rn whether to limit it search to messag header which can be use when the object is to never see messag from a particular person a look through an entir messag h look just at the header you can leav out the modifi command in which case rn will look onli at the subject line of messag the j at the end tell rn to screen out all articl with the offend word so if you never want to see the word foo in ani header ever again type this /foo/hj this is particular use for get rid of articl from peopl who post in more than one newsgroup such as cascad sinc an articl newsgroup name is alway in the header if you just want to block messag with a subject line about cascad you could tri /foo/j to kill anyth that is a followup to ani articl use this pattern /subject re/j when done write line for each phrase to screen exit the text editor as you normal would and youll be put back in rn one word of caution go easi on the global killfil an extens global killfil or one that make frequent use of the a modifi can dramat slow down rn sinc the system will now have to look at everi singl word in everi singl messag in all the newsgroup you want to read if there a particular person whose post you never want to see again first find his or her address which will be in the from line of his post and then write a line in your killfil like this /from nameaddress\all/hj 43 some usenet hint case count in unix most of the time mani unix command includ mani of

usenet for a guid to social newsgroup and mail list which give brief summari of the various soc newsgroup manag uucp and usenet by tim oreilli and grace todino oreilli and associ 1992 is a good guid for set up your own usenet system chapter 5 mail list and bitnet 51 internet mail list usenet is not the onli forum on the net score of mail list repres anoth way to interact with other net user unlik usenet messag which are store in one central locat on your host system comput mail list messag are deliv right to your e mail box unlik usenet messag you have to ask for permiss to join a mail list unlik usenet where your messag is distribut to the world on a mail list you send your messag to a central moder who either re mail it to the other peopl on the list or use it to compil a period digest mail to subscrib given the number of newsgroup whi would anybodi bother with a mail list even on usenet there are some topic that just might not generat enough interest for a newsgroup for exampl the queen list which is all about the late freddi mercuri band and becaus a moder decid who can particip a mail list can offer a degre of freedom to speak one mind or not worri about netweeni that is not necessarili possibl on usenet sever group offer anonym post onli the moder know the real name of peopl who contribut exampl includ 12step where peopl enrol in such program as alcohol anonym can discuss their experi and sappho a list limit to gay and bisexu women you can find mail address and descript of these list in the newsannouncenewus newsgroup with the subject of public access mail list mail list now number in the hundr so this post is divid into three part if you find a list to which you want to subscrib send an e mail messag to list requestaddress where list is the name of the mail list and address is the moder e mail address ask to be ad to the list includ your full e mail address just in case someth happen to your messag header along the way and ask if your accept for the address to mail messag to the list 52 bitnet as if usenet and mail list were not enough there are bitnet discuss group or list bitnet is an intern network link colleg and univers but it use a differ set of technic protocol for distribut inform from the internet or usenet it offer hundr of discuss group compar in scope to usenet newsgroup one of the major differ is the way messag are distribut bitnet messag are sent to your mailbox just as with a mail list howev where mail list are often maintain by a person all bitnet discuss group are autom you subscrib to them through messag to a listserv comput this is a kind of robot moder that control distribut of messag on the list in mani case it also maintain index and archiv of past post in a given discuss group which can be handi if you want to get up to speed with a discuss or just search for some inform relat to it mani bitnet discuss group are now translat into usenet form and carri through usenet in the bitlistserv hierarchi in general it probabl better to read messag through usenet if you can it save some storag space on your host system hard drive if 50 peopl subscrib to the same bitnet list that mean 50 copi of each messag get store on the system wherea if 50 peopl read a usenet messag that still onli one messag that need storag on the system it can also save your saniti if the discuss group generat larg number of messag think of open your e mailbox one day to find 200 messag in it 199 of them from a discuss group and one of them a real e mail messag that import to you subscrib and cancel subscript is done through an e mail messag to the listserv comput for address all listserv are known as listserv yep at some bitnet address this mean you will have to add bitnet to the end of the address if it in a form like this listservmiamiu for exampl if you have an interest in environment issu you might want to subscrib to the econet discuss group to subscrib send an e mail messag to listservmiamiubitnet some bitnet listserv are also connect to the internet so if you see a listserv address end in edu you can e mail the listserv without ad bitnet to the end alway leav the subject line blank in a messag to a listserv insid the messag you tell the listserv what you want with a seri of simpl command subscrib group your name to subscrib to a list where group is the list name and your name is your full name for exampl subscrib econet henri field unsubscrib group your name to discontinu a group for exampl unsubscrib econet henri field list global this send you a list of all avail bitnet discuss group but be care the list is veri long get refcard send you a list of other command you can use with a listserv such as command for retriev past post from a discuss group each of these command goe on a separ line in your messag and you can use one or all of them if you want to get a list of all bitnet discuss group send e mail to listservbitniceducomedu leav the subject line blank and use the list global command when you subscrib to a bitnet group there are two import differ from usenet first when you want to post a messag for other to read in the discuss group you send a messag to the group name at it bitnet address use econet as an exampl you would mail the messag to econetmiamiubitnet note that this is differ from the listserv address you use to subscrib to the group to begin with use the listserv address onli to subscrib to or unsubscrib from a discuss group if you use the discuss group address to tri to subscrib or unsubscrib your messag will go out to everi other subscrib mani of whom will think unkind thought which they may share with you in an e mail messag the second differ relat to send an e mail messag to the author of a particular post usenet newsread such as rn and nn let you do this with one key but if you hit your r key to respond to a discuss group messag your messag will go to the listserv and from there to everybodi els on the list this can prove embarrass to you and annoy to other to make sure your messag goe just to the person who wrote the post take down his e mail address from the post and then compos a brand new messag rememb also that if you see an e mail address like izzyindyvm it a bitnet address two bitnet list will prove help for delv further into the network new list tell you the name of new discuss group to subscrib send a messag to

possibl want to know about the net itself first youll see how to get these file then well show you where theyr kept the commonest way to get these file is through the file transfer protocol or ftp as with telnet not all system that connect to the net have access to ftp howev if your system is one of these youll be abl to get mani of these file through e mail see the next chapter start ftp is as easi as use telnet at your host system command line type ftp sitenam and hit enter where sitenam is the address of the ftp site you want to reach one major differ between telnet and ftp is that it is consid bad form to connect to most ftp site dure their busi hour general 6 am to 6 pm local time this is becaus transfer file across the network take up consider comput power which dure the day is like to be need for whatev the comput main function is there are some ftp site that are access to the public 24 hour a day though youll find these note in the list of ftp site in section 76 72 your friend archi how do you find a file you want though until a few year ago this could be quit the pain there was no master directori to tell you where a given file might be store on the net whod want to slog through hundr of file librari look for someth alan emtag bill heelan and peter deutsch student at mcgill univers in montreal ask the same question unlik the weather though they did someth about it they creat a databas system call archi that would period call up file librari and basic find out what they had avail in turn anybodi could dial into archi type in a file name and see where on the net it was avail archi current catalog close to 1000 file librari around the world today there are three way to ask archi to find a file for you through telnet client archi program on your own host system or e mail all three method let you type in a full or partial file name and will tell you where on the net it store if you have access to telnet you can telnet to one of the follow address archiemcgillca archiesuranet archieunledu archieansnet or archierutgersedu if ask for a log in name type archi and hit enter when you connect the key command is prog which you use in this form prog filenam follow by enter where filenam is the program or file your look for if your unsur of a file complet name tri type in part of the name for exampl pkzip will work as well as pkzip204ex the system doe not support dos or unix wildcard if you ask archi to look for pkzip it will tell you it couldnt find anyth by that name one thing to keep in mind is that a file is not necessarili the same as a program it could also be a document this mean you can use archi to search for say everyth onlin relat to the beetl as well as comput program and graphic file a number of net site now have their own archi program that take your request for inform and pass it onto the nearest archi databas ask your system administr if she has it onlin these client program seem to provid inform a lot more quick than the actual archi itself if it is avail at your host system command line type archi s filenam where filenam is the program or document your look for and hit enter the s tell the program to ignor case in a file name and let you search for partial match you might actual want to type it this way archi s filenamemor which will stop the output everi screen handi if there are mani site that carri the file you want or you could open a file on your comput with your text log function the third way for peopl without access to either of the abov is e mail send a messag to archiequichecsmcgillca you can leav the subject line blank insid the messag type prog filenam where filenam is the file your look for you can ask archi to look up sever program by put their name on the same prog line like this prog file1 file2 file3 within a few hour archi will write back with a list of the appropri site in all three case if there is a system that has your file youll get a respons that look someth like this host sumex aimstanfordedu locat /info mac/comm file rw rr 258256 feb 15 1707 zterm 09hqx locat /info mac/misc file rw rr 7490 sep 12 1991 zterm sys7 color iconshqx chanc are you will get a number of similar look respons for each program the host is the system that has the file the locat tell you which directori to look in when you connect to that system ignor the funni look collect of rs and hyphen for now after them come the size of the file or directori list in byte the date it was upload and the name of the file 73 get the file now you want to get that file assum your host site doe have ftp you connect in a similar fashion to telnet by type ftp sumex aimstanfordedu or the name of whichev site you want to reach hit enter if the connect work youll see this connect to sumex aimstanfordedu 220 sumex aim ftp server version 4196 mon jan 13 135223 pst 1992 readi name sumex aimstanfordeduadamg if noth happen after a minut or so hit control c to return to your host system command line but if it has work type anonym and hit enter youll see a lot of refer on the net to anonym ftp this is how it get it name you dont realli have to tell the librari site what your name is the reason is that these site are set up so that anybodi can gain access to certain public file while let peopl with account on the site to log on and access their own person file next youll be ask for your password as a password use your e mail address this will then come up 230 guest connect accept restrict appli remot system type is unix use binari mode to transfer file ftp> now type ls and

dir as well but if your use to ms dos this could lead to confus when you tri to use dir on your host system where it wont work so it probabl better to just rememb to alway use ls for a directori while onlin the veri first letter on each line tell you whether the list is for a directori or a file if the first letter is a ``d or an l it a directori otherwis it a file the rest of that weird set of letter and dash consist of flag that tell the ftp site who can look at chang or delet the file you can safe ignor it you can also ignor the rest of the line until you get to the second number the one just befor the date this tell you how larg the file is in byte if the line is for a directori the number give you a rough indic of how mani item are in that directori a directori list of 512 byte is relat small next come the date the file or directori was upload follow final by it name notic the readmepost file up at the top of the directori most archiv site have a read me document which usual contain some basic inform about the site it resourc and how to use them let get this file both for the inform in it and to see how to transfer file from there to here at the ftp> prompt type get readm and hit enter note that ftp site are no differ from unix site in general they are case sensit youll see someth like this 200 port command success 150 open binari mode data connect for readm 4444 byte 226 transfer complet 4444 byte receiv in 1177second 38 kbytes/ and that it the file is now locat in your home directori on your host system from which you can now download it to your own comput the simpl get command is the key to transfer a file from an archiv site to your host system if you want to download more than one file at a time say a seri of document use mget instead of get for exampl mget txt this will transfer copi of everi file end with txt in the given directori befor each file is copi youll be ask if your sure you want it despit this mget could still save you consider time you wont have to type in everi singl file name if you want to save even more time and are sure you realli want all of the given file type prompt befor you do the mget command this will turn off the prompt and all the file will be zap right into your home directori there is one other command to keep in mind if you want to get a copi of a comput program type bin and hit enter this tell the ftp site and your host site that you are send a binari file ie a program most ftp site now use binari format as a default but it a good idea to do this in case youv connect to one of the few that doesnt to switch to a directori type cd directori name substitut the name of the directori you want to access and hit enter type ls and hit enter to get the file list for that particular directori to move back up the directori tree type cd note the space between the d and the first period and hit enter or you could type cdup and hit enter keep do this until you get to the directori of interest altern if you alreadi know the directori path of the file you want from our friend archi after you connect you could simpli type get directory/subdirectory/filenam on mani site file meant for public consumpt are in the pub or public directori sometim youll see an info directori almost everi site has a bin directori which at first glanc sound like a bin in which interest stuff might be dump but it actual stand for binari and is simpli a place for the system administr to store the program that run the ftp system lost+found is anoth directori that look interest but actual never has anyth of public interest in them befor you saw how to use archi from our exampl you can see that some system administr go a littl berserk when name file fortun there a way for you to renam the file as it be transfer use our archi exampl youd type get zterm sys7 color iconshqx ztermhqx and hit enter instead of have to deal constant with a file call zterm sys7 color iconshqx youll now have one call simpli ztermhqx those last three letter bring up someth els mani program file are compress to save on space and transmiss time in order to actual use them youll have to use an un compress program on them first 74 odd letter decod file end there are a wide varieti of compress method in use you can tell which method was use by the last one to three letter at the end of a file here are some of the more common one and what youll need to un compress the file they creat most of these decompress program can be locat through archi txt or txt by itself this mean the file is a document rather than a program ps or ps a postscript document in adob page descript languag you can print this file on ani postscript capabl printer or use a preview like gnu project ghostscript doc or doc anoth common extens for document no decompress is need unless it is follow by z this indic a unix compress method to uncompress type uncompress filenamez and hit enter at your host system command line if the file is a compress text file you can read it onlin by instead type zcat filenametxtz more u16zip is an ms dos program that will let you download such a file and uncompress it on your own comput the macintosh equival program is call maccompress use archi to find these zip or zip these indic the file has been compress with a common ms dos compress program known as pkzip use archi to find pkzip204ex mani unix system will let you un zip a file with a program call well unzip gz a unix version of zip to uncompress type gunzip filenamegz at your host system command line zoo or zoo a unix and ms dos compress format use a program call zoo to uncompress hqx or hqx mactintosh compress format requir the binhex program shar or anoth unix format use unshar to uncompress shar tar anoth unix format often use to compress sever relat file into one larg file most unix system will have a program call tar for un tar such file often a tar file will also be compress with the gz method so you first have to use uncompress and then tar sit or sit a mactinosh format that requir the stuffit program arc anoth ms dos format which requir the use of the arc or arc program lhz anoth ms dos format requir the use of lharc a few last word of caution check the size of a file befor you get it the net move data at phenomen rate of speed but that 500000 byte file that get transfer to your host system in a few second could take more than an hour or two to download to your comput if your use a 2400 baud modem your host system may also have limit on the amount of byte you can store onlin at ani one time also although it is realli extrem unlik you will ever get a file infect with a virus if you plan to do much download over the net youd be wise to invest in a good anti viral program just in case 75 the keyboard cabal system administr are like everybodi els they tri to make thing easier for themselv and when you sit in front of a keyboard all day that can mean tri everyth possibl to reduc the number of key you actual have to hit each day unfortun that can make it difficult for the rest of us youv alreadi read about bin and lost+found directori etc is anoth seem interest directori that turn out to be anoth place to store file use by the ftp site itself again noth of ani real interest then onc you get into the actual file librari youll find that in mani case file will have such non descript name as v11 aktxt the best known exampl is probabl a set of sever hundr file known as rfcs which provid the basic technic and organiz inform on which much of the internet is built these file can be found on mani ftp site but alway in a form such as rfc101txt rfc102txt and so on with no clue whatsoev as to what inform they contain fortun almost all ftp site have a rosetta stone to help you deciph these name most will have a file name readm or some variant that give basic inform about the system then most directori will either have a similar readm file or will have an index that doe give brief descript of each file these are usual the first file in a directori and often are in the form 00indextxt use the ftp command to get this file you can then scan it onlin or download it to see which file you might be interest in anoth file you will frequent see is call ls lrz this contain a list of everi file on the system but without ani descript the name come from the unix command ls lr which give you a list of all the file in all your directori the z at the end mean the file has been compress which mean you will have to use a unix un compress command befor you can read the file and final we have those system administr who almost seem to delight in make thing difficult the one who take full advantag of unix abil to creat absurd long file name on some ftp site you will see file name as long as 80 charact or so full of capit letter underscor and everi other orthograph devic that will make it almost imposs for you to type the file name correct when you tri to get it your secret weapon here is the mget command just type mget a space and the first five or six letter of the file name follow by an asterisk for exampl mget this f the ftp site will ask you if you want to get the file that begin with that name if there are sever file that start that way you might have to answer n a few time but it still easier than tri to recreat a ludicr long file name 76 some interest ftp site what follow is a list of some

general it doesnt matter which of the particular veronica you use they should all be abl to produc the same result the reason there is more than one is becaus the internet has becom so popular that

gopher system on which they resid if there are particular gopher resourc you use frequent there are a coupl of way to get to them even more direct one is to use gopher in a manner similar to the way
