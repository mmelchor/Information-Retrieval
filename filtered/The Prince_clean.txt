liberti and peac here we are on firm ground when deal with the event of machiavelli life for dure this time he took a lead part in the affair of the republ and we have it decre record and dispatch to guid us as well as his own write a mere recapitul of a few of his transact with the statesmen and soldier of his time give a fair indic of his activ and suppli the sourc from which he drew the experi and charact which illustr the princ his first mission was in 1499 to catherina sforza my ladi of for of the princ from whose conduct and fate he drew the moral that it is far better to earn the confid of the peopl than to reli on fortress this is a veri notic principl in machiavelli and is urg by him in mani way as a matter of vital import to princ in 1500 he was sent to franc to obtain term from loui xii for continu the war against pisa this king it was who in his conduct of affair in itali commit the five capit error in statecraft summar in the princ and was consequ driven out he also it was who made the dissolut of his marriag a condit of support to pope alexand vi which lead machiavelli to refer those who urg that such promis should be kept to what he has written concern the faith of princ machiavelli public life was larg occupi with event aris out of the ambit of pope alexand vi and his son cesar borgia the duke valentino and these charact fill a larg space of the princ machiavelli never hesit to cite the action of the duke for the benefit of usurp who wish to keep the state they have seiz he can inde find no precept to offer so good as the pattern of cesar borgia conduct insomuch that cesar is acclaim by some critic as the hero of the princ yet in the princ the duke is in point of fact cite as a type of the man who rise on the fortun of other and fall with them who take everi cours that might be expect from a prudent man but the cours which will save him who is prepar for all eventu but the one which happen and who when all his abil fail to carri him through exclaim that it was not his fault but an extraordinari and unforeseen fatal on the death of pius iii in 1503 machiavelli was sent to rome to watch the elect of his successor and there he saw cesar borgia cheat into allow the choic of the colleg to fall on giuliano dell rover julius ii who was one of the cardin that had most reason to fear the duke machiavelli when comment on this elect say that he who think new favour will caus great personag to forget old injuri deceiv himself julius did not rest until he had ruin cesar it was to julius ii that machiavelli was sent in 1506 when that pontiff was commenc his enterpris against bologna which he brought to a success issu as he did mani of his other adventur owe chiefli to his impetu charact it is in refer to pope julius that machiavelli moral on the resembl between fortun and women and conclud that it is the bold rather than the cautious man that will win and hold them both it is imposs to follow here the vari fortun of the italian state which in 1507 were control by franc spain and germani with result that have last to our day we are concern with those event and with the three great actor in them so far onli as they imping on the person of machiavelli he had sever meet with loui xii of franc and his estim of that monarch charact has alreadi been allud to machiavelli has paint ferdinand of aragon as the man who accomplish great thing under the cloak of religion but who in realiti had no merci faith human or integr and who had he allow himself to be influenc by such motiv would have been ruin the emperor maximilian was one of the most interest men of the age and his charact has been drawn by mani hand but machiavelli who was an envoy at his court in 1507 8 reveal the secret of his mani failur when he describ him as a secret man without forc of characterignor the human agenc necessari to carri his scheme into effect and never insist on the fulfil of his wish the remain year of machiavelli offici career were fill with event aris out of the leagu of cambrai made in 1508 between the three great european power alreadi mention and the pope with the object of crush the venetian republ this result was attain in the battl of vaila when venic lost in one day all that she had won in eight hundr year florenc had a difficult part to play dure these event complic as they were by the feud which broke out between the pope and the french becaus friendship with franc had dictat the entir polici of the republ when in 1511 julius ii final form the holi leagu against franc and with the assist of the swiss drove the french out of itali florenc lay at the merci of the pope and had to submit to his term one of which was that the medici should be restor the return of the medici to florenc on 1st septemb 1512 and the consequ fall of the republ was the signal for the dismiss of machiavelli and his friend and thus put an end to his public career for as we have seen he die without regain offic literatur and death aet 43 581512 27 on the return of the medici machiavelli who for a few week had vain hope to retain his offic under the new master of florenc was dismiss by decre date 7th novemb

small properti at san casciano near florenc where he devot himself to literatur in a letter to francesco vettori date 13th decemb 1513 he has left a veri interest descript of his life at this period which elucid his method and his motiv in write the princ after describ his daili occup with his famili and neighbour he write the even be come i return home and go to my studi at the entranc i pull off my peasant cloth cover with dust and dirt and put on my nobl court dress and thus becom re cloth i pass into the ancient court of the men of old where be love receiv by them i am fed with that food which is mine alon where i do not hesit to speak with them and to ask for the reason of their action and they in their benign answer me and for four hour i feel no weari i forget everi troubl poverti doe not dismay death doe not terrifi me i am possess entir by those great men and becaus dant say knowledg doth come of learn well retain unfruit els i have note down what i have gain from their convers and have compos a small work on princip where i pour myself out as fulli as i can in medit on the subject discuss what a princip is what kind there are how they can be acquir how they can be kept whi they are lost and if ani of my fanci ever pleas you this ought not to displeas you and to a princ especi to a new one it should be welcom therefor i dedic it to his magnific giuliano filippo casavecchio has seen it he will be abl to tell you what is in it and of the discours i have had with him nevertheless i am still enrich and polish it the littl book suffer mani vicissitud befor attain the form in which it has reach us various mental influenc were at work dure it composit it titl and patron were chang and for some unknown reason it was final dedic to lorenzo de medici although machiavelli discuss with casavecchio whether it should be sent or present in person to the patron there is no evid that lorenzo ever receiv or even read it he certain never gave machiavelli ani employ although it was plagiar dure machiavelli lifetim the princ was never publish by him and it text is still disput machiavelli conclud his letter to vettori thus and as to this littl thing his book when it has been read it will be seen that dure the fifteen year i have given to the studi of statecraft i have neither slept nor idl and men ought ever to desir to be serv by one who has reap experi at the expens of other and of my loyalti none could doubt becaus have alway kept faith i could not now learn how to break it for he who has been faith and honest as i have cannot chang his natur and my poverti is a wit to my honesti befor machiavelli had got the princ off his hand he commenc his discours on the first decad of titus livius which should be read concurr with the princ these and sever minor work occupi him until the year 1518 when he accept a small commiss to look after the affair of some florentin merchant at genoa in 1519 the medicean ruler of florenc grant a few polit concess to her citizen and machiavelli with other was consult upon a new constitut under which the great council was to be restor but on one pretext or anoth it was not promulg in 1520 the florentin merchant again had recours to machiavelli to settl their difficulti with lucca but this year was chiefli remark for his re entri into florentin literari societi where he was much sought after and also for the product of his art of war it was in the same year that he receiv a commiss at the instanc of cardin de medici to write the histori of florenc a task which occupi him until 1525 his return to popular favour may have determin the medici to give him this employ for an old writer observ that an abl statesman out of work like a huge whale will endeavour to overturn the ship unless he has an empti cask to play with when the histori of florenc was finish machiavelli took it to rome for present to his patron giuliano de medici who had in the meanwhil becom pope under the titl of clement vii it is somewhat remark that as in 1513 machiavelli had written the princ for the instruct of the medici after they had just regain power in florenc so in 1525 he dedic the histori of florenc to the head of the famili when it ruin was now at hand in that year the battl of pavia destroy the french rule in itali and left franci i a prison in the hand of his great rival charl v this was follow by the sack of rome upon the news of which the popular parti at florenc threw off the yoke of the medici who were onc more banish machiavelli was absent from florenc at this time but hasten his return hope to secur his former offic of secretari to the ten of liberti and peac unhappili he was taken ill soon after he reach florenc where he die on 22nd june 1527 the man and his work no one can say where the bone of machiavelli rest but modern florenc has decre him a state cenotaph in santa croce by the side of her most famous son recogn that whatev other nation may have found in his work itali found in them the idea of her uniti and the germ of her renaiss among the nation of europ whilst it is idl to protest against the world wide and evil signif of his name it may be point out that the harsh construct of his doctrin which this sinist reput impli was unknown to his own day and that the research of recent time have enabl us to interpret him more reason it is due to these inquiri that the shape of an unholi necromanc which so long haunt men vision has begun to fade machiavelli was undoubt a man of great observ acut and industri note with appreci eye whatev pass befor him and with his suprem literari gift turn it to account in his enforc retir from affair he doe not present himself nor is he depict by his contemporari as a type of that rare combin the success statesman and author for he appear to have been onli moder prosper in his sever embassi and polit employ he was misl by catherina sforza ignor by loui xii overaw by cesar borgia sever of his embassi were quit barren of result his attempt to fortifi florenc fail and the soldieri that he rais astonish everybodi by their cowardic in the conduct of his own affair he was timid and time serv he dare not appear by the side of soderini to whom he owe so much for fear of compromis himself his connect with the medici was open to suspicion and giuliano appear to have recogn his real fort when he set him to write the histori of florenc rather than employ him in the state and it is on the literari side of his charact and there alon that we find no weak and no failur although the light of almost four centuri has been focus on the princ it problem are still debat and interest becaus they are the etern problem between the rule and their ruler such as they are it ethic are those of machiavelli contemporari yet they cannot be said to be out of date so long as the govern of europ reli on materi rather than on moral forc it histor incid and personag becom interest by reason of the use which machiavelli make of them to illustr his theori of govern and conduct leav out of consider those maxim of state which still furnish some european and eastern statesmen with principl of action the princ is bestrewn with truth that can be prove at everi turn men are still the dupe of their simplic and greed as they were in the day of alexand vi the cloak of religion still conceal the vice which machiavelli laid bare in the charact of ferdinand of aragon men will not look at thing as they realli are but as they wish them to beand are ruin in polit there are no perfect safe cours prudenc consist in choos the least danger one thento pass to a higher planemachiavelli reiter that although crime may win an empir they do not win glori necessari war are just war and the arm of a nation are hallow when it has no other resourc but to fight it is the cri of a far later day than machiavelli that govern should be elev into a live moral forc capabl of inspir the peopl with a just recognit of the fundament principl of societi to this high argument the princ contribut but littl machiavelli alway refus to write either of men or of govern otherwis than as he found them and he write with such skill and insight that his work is of abid valu but what invest the princ with more than a mere artist or histor interest is the incontrovert truth that it deal with the great principl which still guid nation and ruler in their relationship with each other and their neighbour in translat the princ my aim has been to achiev at all cost an exact liter render of the origin rather than a fluent paraphras adapt to the modern notion of style and express machiavelli was no facil phrasemong the condit under which he wrote oblig him to weigh everi word his theme were lofti his substanc grave his manner nobli plain and serious qui eo fuit unquam in partiundi rebus in definiendi in explanandi pressior in the princ it may be truli said there is reason assign not onli for everi word but for the posit of everi word to an englishman of shakespear time the translat of such a treatis was in some way a compar easi task for in those time the genius of the english more near resembl that of the italian languag to the englishman of to day it is not so simpl to take a singl exampl the word intrattener employ by machiavelli to indic the polici adopt by the roman senat toward the weaker state of greec would by an elizabethan be correct render entertain and everi contemporari reader would understand what was meant by say that rome entertain the aetolian and the achaean without augment their power but to day such a phrase would seem obsolet and ambigu if not unmean we are compel to say that rome maintain friend relat with the aetolian etc use four word to do the work of one i have tri to preserv the pithi breviti of the italian so far as was consist with an absolut fidel to the sens if the result be an occasion asper i can onli hope that the reader in his eager to reach the author

those who strive to obtain the good grace of a princ are accustom to come befor him with such thing as they hold most precious or in which they see him take most delight whenc one often see hors arm cloth of gold precious stone and similar ornament present to princ worthi of their great desir therefor to present myself to your magnific with some testimoni of my devot toward you i have not found among my possess anyth which i hold more dear than or valu so much as the knowledg of the action of great men acquir by long experi in contemporari affair and a continu studi of antiqu which have reflect upon it with great and prolong dilig i now send digest into a littl volum to your magnific and although i may consid this work unworthi of your counten nevertheless i trust much to your benign that it may be accept see that it is not possibl for me to make a better gift than to offer you the opportun of understand in the shortest time all that i have learnt in so mani year and with so mani troubl and danger which work i have not embellish with swell or magnific word nor stuf with round period nor with ani extrins allur or adorn whatev with which so mani are accustom to embellish their work for i have wish either that no honour should be given it or els that the truth of the matter and the weighti of the theme shall make it accept nor do i hold with those who regard it as a presumpt if a man of low and humbl condit dare to discuss and settl the concern of princ becaus just as those who draw landscap place themselv below in the plain to contempl the natur of the mountain and of lofti place and in order to contempl the plain place themselv upon high mountain even so to understand the natur of the peopl it need to be a princ and to understand that of princ it need to be of the peopl take then your magnific this littl gift in the spirit in which i send it wherein if it be dilig read and consid by you you will learn my extrem desir that you should attain that great which fortun and your other attribut promis and if your magnific from the summit of your great will sometim turn your eye to these lower region you will see how unmerit i suffer a great and continu malign of fortun the princ chapter i how mani kind of princip there are and by what mean they are acquir all state all power that have held and hold rule over men have been and are either republ or princip princip are either hereditari in which the famili has been long establish or they are new the new are either entir new as was milan to francesco sforza or they are as it were member annex to the hereditari state of the princ who has acquir them as was the kingdom of napl to that of the king of spain such dominion thus acquir are either accustom to live under a princ or to live in freedom and are acquir either by the arm of the princ himself or of other or els by fortun or by abil chapter ii concern hereditari princip i will leav out all discuss on republ inasmuch as in anoth place i have written of them at length and will address myself onli to princip in do so i will keep to the order indic abov and discuss how such princip are to be rule and preserv i say at onc there are fewer difficulti in hold hereditari state and those long accustom to the famili of their princ than new one for it is suffici onli not to transgress the custom of his ancestor and to deal prudent with circumst as they aris for a princ of averag power to maintain himself in his state unless he be depriv of it by some extraordinari and excess forc and if he should be so depriv of it whenev anyth sinist happen to the usurp he will regain it we have in itali for exampl the duke of ferrara who could not have withstood the attack of the venetian in 84 nor those of pope julius in 10 unless he had been long establish in his dominion for the hereditari princ has less caus and less necess to offend henc it happen that he will be more love and unless extraordinari vice caus him to be hate it is reason to expect that his subject will be natur well dispos toward him and in the antiqu and durat of his rule the memori and motiv that make for chang are lost for one chang alway leav the tooth for anoth chapter iii concern mix princip but the difficulti occur in a new princip and first if it be not entir new but is as it were a member of a state which taken collect may be call composit the chang aris chiefli from an inher difficulti which there is in all new princip for men chang their ruler will hope to better themselv and this hope induc them to take up arm against him who rule wherein they are deceiv becaus they afterward find by experi they have gone from bad to wors this follow also on anoth natur and common necess which alway caus a new princ to burden those who have submit to him with his soldieri and with infinit other hardship which he must put upon his new acquisit in this way you have enemi in all those whom you have injur in seiz that princip and you are not abl to keep those friend who put you there becaus of your not be abl to satisfi them in the way they expect and you cannot take strong measur against them feel bound to them for although one may be veri strong in arm forc yet in enter a provinc one has alway need of the goodwil of the nativ for these reason loui the twelfth king of franc quick occupi milan and as quick lost it and to turn him out the first time it onli need lodovico own forc becaus those who had open the gate to him find themselv deceiv in their hope of futur benefit would not endur the ill treatment of the new princ it is veri true that after acquir rebelli provinc a second time they are not so light lost afterward becaus the princ with littl reluct take the opportun of the rebellion to punish the delinqu to clear out the suspect and to strengthen himself in the weakest place thus to caus franc to lose milan the first time it was enough for the duke lodovico to rais insurrect on the border but to caus him to lose it a second time it was necessari to bring the whole world against him and that his armi should be defeat and driven out of itali which follow from the caus abov mention duke lodovico was lodovico moro a son of francesco sforza who marri beatric dest he rule over milan from 1494 to 1500 and die in 1510 nevertheless milan was taken from franc both the first and the second time the general reason for the first have been discuss it remain to name those for the second and to see what resourc he had and what ani one in his situat would have had for maintain himself more secur in his acquisit than did the king of franc now i say that those dominion which when acquir are ad to an ancient state by him who acquir them are either of the same countri and languag or they are not when they are it is easier to hold them especi when they have not been accustom to self govern and to hold them secur it is enough to have destroy the famili of the princ who was rule them becaus the two peopl preserv in other thing the old condit and not be unlik in custom will live quiet togeth as one has seen in brittani burgundi gasconi and normandi which have been bound to franc for so long a time and although there may be some differ in languag nevertheless the custom are alik and the peopl will easili be abl to get on amongst themselv he who has annex them if he wish to hold them has onli to bear in mind two consider the one that the famili of their former lord is extinguish the other that neither their law nor their tax are alter so that in a veri short time they will becom entir one bodi with the old princip but when state are acquir in a countri differ in languag custom or law there are difficulti and good fortun and great energi are need to hold them and one of the greatest and most real help would be that he who has acquir them should go and resid there this would make his posit more secur and durabl as it has made that of the turk in greec who notwithstand all the other measur taken by him for hold that state if he had not settl there would not have been abl to keep it becaus if one is on the spot disord are seen as they spring up and one can quick remedi them but if one is not at hand they are heard of onli when they are great and then one can no longer remedi them besid this the countri is not pillag by your offici the subject are satisfi by prompt recours to the princ thus wish to be good they have more caus to love him and wish to be otherwis to fear him he who would attack that state from the outsid must have the utmost caution as long as the princ resid there it can onli be wrest from him with the greatest difficulti the other and better cours is to send coloni to one or two place which may be as key to that state for it is necessari either to do this or els to keep there a great number of cavalri and infantri a princ doe not spend much on coloni for with littl or no expens he can send them out and keep them there and he offend a minor onli of the citizen from whom he take land and hous to give them to the new inhabit and those whom he offend remain poor and scatter are never abl to injur him whilst the rest be uninjur are easili kept quiet and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear it should happen to them as it has to those who have been despoil in conclus i say that these coloni are not cost they are more faith they injur less and the injur as has been said be poor and scatter cannot hurt upon this one has to remark that men ought either to be well treat or crush becaus they can aveng themselv of lighter injuri of more serious one they cannot therefor the injuri that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one doe not stand in fear of reveng but in maintain arm men there in place of coloni one spend much more have to consum on the garrison all the incom from the state so that the acquisit turn into a loss and mani more are exasper becaus the whole state is injur through the shift of the garrison up and down all becom acquaint with hardship and all becom hostil and they are enemi who whilst beaten on their own ground are yet abl to do hurt for everi reason therefor such guard are as useless as a coloni is use again the princ who hold a countri differ in the abov respect ought to make himself the head and defend of his less power neighbour and to weaken the more power amongst them take care that no foreign as power as himself shall by ani accid get a foot there for it will alway happen that such a one will be introduc by those who are discont either through excess of ambit or through fear as one has seen alreadi the roman were brought into greec by the aetolian and in everi other countri where they obtain a foot they were brought in by the inhabit and the usual cours of affair is that as soon as a power foreign enter a countri all the subject state are drawn to him move by the hatr which they feel against the rule power so that in respect to those subject state he has not to take ani troubl to gain them over to himself for the whole of them quick ralli to the state which he has acquir there he has onli to take care that they do not get hold of too much power and too much author and then with his own forc and with their goodwil he can easili keep down the more power of them so as to remain entir master in the countri and he who doe not proper manag this busi will soon lose what he has acquir and whilst he doe hold it he will have endless difficulti and troubl the roman in the countri which they annex observ close these measur they sent coloni and maintain friend relat with the minor power without increas their strength they kept down the greater and did not allow ani strong foreign power to gain author greec appear to me suffici for an exampl the achaean and aetolian were kept friend by them the kingdom of macedonia was humbl antiochus was driven out yet the merit of the achaean and aetolian never secur for them permiss to increas their power nor did the persuas of philip ever induc the roman to be his friend without first humbl him nor did the influenc of antiochus make them agre that he should retain ani lordship over the countri becaus the roman did in these instanc what all prudent princ ought to do who have to regard not onli present troubl but also futur one for which they must prepar with everi energi becaus when foreseen it is easi to remedi them but if you wait until they approach the medicin is no longer in time becaus the maladi has becom incur for it happen in this as the physician say it happen in hectic fever that in the begin of the maladi it is easi to cure but difficult to detect but in the cours of time not have been either detect or treat in the begin it becom easi to detect but difficult to cure this it happen in affair of state for when the evil that aris have been foreseen which it is onli given to a wise man to see they can be quick redress but when through not have been foreseen they have been permit to grow in a way that everi one can see them there is no longer a remedi therefor the roman forese troubl dealt with them at onc and even to avoid a war would not let them come to a head for they knew that war is not to be avoid but is onli to be put off to the advantag of other moreov they wish to fight with philip and antiochus in greec so as not to have to do it in itali they could have avoid both but this they did not wish nor did that ever pleas them which is for ever in the mouth of the wise one of our timelet us enjoy the benefit of the timebut rather the benefit of their own valour and prudenc for time drive everyth befor it and is abl to bring with it good as well as evil and evil as well as good see remark in the introduct on the word intrattener but let us turn to franc and inquir whether she has done ani of the thing mention i will speak of loui and not of charles+ as the one whose conduct is the better to be observ he have held possess of itali for the longest period and you will see that he has done the opposit to those thing which ought to be done to retain a state compos of diver element loui xii king of franc the father of the peopl born 1462 die 1515 + charl viii king of franc born 1470 die 1498 king loui was brought into itali by the ambit of the venetian who desir to obtain half the state of lombardi by his intervent i will not blame the cours taken by the king becaus wish to get a foothold in itali and have no friend therese rather that everi door was shut to him owe to the conduct of charlesh was forc to accept those friendship which he could get and he would have succeed veri quick in his design if in other matter he had not made some mistak the king howev have acquir lombardi regain at onc the author which charl had lost genoa yield the florentin becam his friend the marquess of mantua the duke of ferrara the bentivog my ladi of for the lord of faenza of pesaro of rimini of camerino of piombino the lucches the pisan the sieneseeverybodi made advanc to him to becom his friend then could the venetian realiz the rash of the cours taken by them which in order that they might secur two town in lombardi had made the king master of two third of itali let ani one now consid with what littl difficulti the king could have maintain his posit in itali had he observ the rule abov laid down and kept all his friend secur and protect for although they were numer they were both weak and timid some afraid of the church some of the venetian and thus they would alway have been forc to stand in with him and by their mean he could easili have made himself secur against those who remain power but he was no sooner in milan than he did the contrari by assist pope alexand to occupi the romagna it never occur to him that by this action he was weaken himself depriv himself of friend and of those who had thrown themselv into his lap whilst he aggrand the church by ad much tempor power to the spiritu thus give it greater author and have commit this prime error he was oblig to follow it up so much so that to put an end to the ambit of alexand and to prevent his becom the master of tuscani he was himself forc to come into itali and as if it were not enough to have aggrand the church and depriv himself of friend he wish to have the kingdom of napl divid it with the king of spain and where he was the prime arbit in itali he take an associ so that the ambiti of that countri and the malcont of his own should have somewher to shelter and wherea he could have left in the kingdom his own pension as king he drove him out to put one there who was abl to drive him loui out in turn the wish to acquir is in truth veri natur and common and men alway do so when they can and for this they will be prais not blame but when they cannot do so yet wish to do so by ani mean then there is folli and blame therefor if franc could have attack napl with her own forc she ought to have done so if she could not then she ought not to have divid it and if the partit which she made with the venetian in lombardi was justifi by the excus that by it she got a foothold in itali this other partit merit blame for it had not the excus of that necess therefor loui made these five error he destroy the minor power he increas the strength of one of the greater power in itali he brought in a foreign power he did not settl in the countri he did not send coloni which error had he live were not enough to injur him had he not made a sixth by take away their dominion from the venetian becaus had he not aggrand the church nor brought spain into itali it would have been veri reason and necessari to humbl them but have first taken these step he ought never to have consent to their ruin for they be power would alway have kept off other from design on lombardi to which the venetian would never have consent except to becom master themselv there also becaus the other would not wish to take lombardi from franc in order to give it to the venetian and to run counter to both they would not have had the courag and if ani one should say king loui yield the romagna to alexand and the kingdom to spain to avoid war i answer for the reason given abov that a blunder ought never to be perpetr to avoid war becaus it is not to be avoid but is onli defer to your disadvantag and if anoth should alleg the pledg which the king had given to the pope that he would assist him in the enterpris in exchang for the dissolut of his marriag and for the cap to rouen+ to that i repli what i shall write later on concern the faith of princ and how it ought to be kept loui xii divorc his wife jeann daughter of loui xi and marri in 1499 ann of brittani widow of charl viii in order to retain the duchi of brittani for the crown + the archbishop of rouen he was georg dambois creat a cardin by alexand vi born 1460 die 1510 thus king loui lost lombardi by not have follow ani of the condit observ by those who have taken possess of countri and wish to retain them nor is there ani miracl in this but much that is reason and quit natur and on these matter i spoke at nant with rouen when valentino as cesar borgia the son of pope alexand was usual call occupi the romagna and on cardin rouen observ to me that the italian did not understand war i repli to him that the french did not understand statecraft mean that otherwis they would not have allow the church to reach such great and in fact it has been seen that the great of the church and of spain in itali has been caus by franc and her ruin may be attribut to them from this a general rule is drawn which never or rare fail that he who is the caus of anoth becom power is ruin becaus that predomin has been brought about either by astut or els by forc and both are distrust by him who has been rais to power chapter iv whi the kingdom of darius conquer by alexand did not rebel against the successor of alexand at his death consid the difficulti which men have had to hold to a newli acquir state some might wonder how see that alexand the great becam the master of asia in a few year and die whilst it was scarc settl whenc it might appear reason that the whole empir would have rebel nevertheless his successor maintain themselv and had to meet no other difficulti than that which aros among themselv from their own ambit i answer that the princip of which one has record are found to be govern in two differ way either by a princ with a bodi of servant who assist him to govern the kingdom as minist by his favour and permiss or by a princ and baron who hold that digniti by antiqu of blood and not by the grace of the princ such baron have state and their own subject who recogn them as lord and hold them in natur affect those state that are govern by a princ and his servant hold their princ in more consider becaus in all the countri there is no one who is recogn as superior to him and if they yield obedi to anoth they do it as to a minist and offici and they do not bear him ani particular affect the exampl of these two govern in our time are the turk and the king of franc the entir monarchi of the turk is govern by one lord the other are his servant and divid his kingdom into sanjak he send there differ administr and shift and chang them as he choos but the king of franc is place in the midst of an ancient bodi of lord acknowledg by their own subject and belov by them they have their own prerog nor can the king take these away except at his peril therefor he who consid both of these state will recogn great difficulti in seiz the state of the turk but onc it is conquer great eas in hold it the caus of the difficulti in seiz the kingdom of the turk are that the usurp cannot be call in by the princ of the kingdom nor can he hope to be assist in his design by the revolt of those whom the lord has around him this aris from the reason given abov for his minist be all slave and bondmen can onli be corrupt with great difficulti and one can expect littl advantag from them when they have been corrupt as they cannot carri the peopl with them for the reason assign henc he who attack the turk must bear in mind that he will find him unit and he will have to reli more on his own strength than on the revolt of other but if onc the turk has been conquer and rout in the field in such a way that he cannot replac his armi there is noth to fear but the famili of this princ and this be extermin there remain no one to fear the other have no credit with the peopl and as the conqueror did not reli on them befor his victori so he ought not to fear them after it the contrari happen in kingdom govern like that of franc becaus one can easili enter there by gain over some baron of the kingdom for one alway find malcont and such as desir a chang such men for the reason given can open the way into the state and render the victori easi but if you wish to hold it afterward you meet with infinit difficulti both from those who have assist you and from those you have crush nor is it enough for you to have extermin the famili of the princ becaus the lord that remain make themselv the head of fresh movement against you and as you are unabl either to satisfi or extermin them that state is lost whenev time bring the opportun now if you will consid what was the natur of the govern of darius you will find it similar to the kingdom of the turk and therefor it was onli necessari for alexand first to overthrow him in the field and then to take the countri from him after which victori darius be kill the state remain secur to alexand for the abov reason and if his successor had been unit they would have enjoy it secur and at their eas for there were no tumult rais in the kingdom except those they provok themselv but it is imposs to hold with such tranquil state constitut like that of franc henc aros those frequent rebellion against the roman in spain franc and greec owe to the mani princip there were in these state of which as long as the memori of them endur the roman alway held an insecur possess but with the power and long continu of the empir the memori of them pass away and the roman then becam secur possessor and when fight afterward amongst themselv each one was abl to attach to himself his own part of the countri accord to the author he had assum there and the famili of the former lord be extermin none other than the roman were acknowledg when these thing are rememb no one will marvel at the eas with which alexand held the empir of asia or at the difficulti which other have had to keep an acquisit such as pyrrhus and mani more this is not occas by the littl or abund of abil in the conqueror but by the want of uniform in the subject state chapter v concern the way to govern citi or princip which live under their own law befor they were annex whenev those state which have been acquir as state have been accustom to live under their own law and in freedom there are three cours for those who wish to hold them the first is to ruin them the next is to resid there in person the third is to permit them to live under their own law draw a tribut and establish within it an oligarchi which will keep it friend to you becaus such a govern be creat by the princ know that it cannot stand without his friendship and interest and doe it utmost to support him and therefor he who would keep a citi accustom to freedom will hold it more easili by the mean of it own citizen than in ani other way there are for exampl the spartan and the roman the spartan held athen and thebe establish there an oligarchi nevertheless they lost them the roman in order to hold capua carthag and numantia dismantl them and did not lose them they wish to hold greec as the spartan held it make it free and permit it law and did not succeed so to hold it they were compel to dismantl mani citi in the countri for in truth there is no safe way to retain them otherwis than by ruin them and he who becom master of a citi accustom to freedom and doe not destroy it may expect to be destroy by it for in rebellion it has alway the watchword of liberti and it ancient privileg as a ralli point which neither time nor benefit will ever caus it to forget and whatev you may do or provid against they never forget that name or their privileg unless they are disunit or dispers but at everi chanc they immedi ralli to them as pisa after the hundr year she had been held in bondag by the florentin but when citi or countri are accustom to live under a princ and his famili is extermin they be on the one hand accustom to obey and on the other hand not have the old princ cannot agre in make one from amongst themselv and they do not know how to govern themselv for this reason they are veri slow to take up arm and a princ can gain them to himself and secur them much more easili but in republ there is more vital greater hatr and more desir for vengeanc which will never permit them to allow the memori of their former liberti to rest so that the safest way is to destroy them or to resid there chapter vi concern new princip which are acquir by one own arm and abil let no one be surpris if in speak of entir new princip as i shall do i adduc the highest exampl both of princ and of state becaus men walk almost alway in path beaten by other and follow by imit their deed are yet unabl to keep entir to the way of other or attain to the power of those they imit a wise man ought alway to follow the path beaten by great men and to imit those who have been suprem so that if his abil doe not equal their at least it will savour of it let him act like the clever archer who design to hit the mark which yet appear too far distant and know the limit to which the strength of their bow attain take aim much higher than the mark not to reach by their strength or arrow to so great a height but to be abl with the aid of so high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach i say therefor that in entir new princip where there is a new princ more or less difficulti is found in keep them accord as there is more or less abil in him who has acquir the state now as the fact of becom a princ from a privat station presuppos either abil or fortun it is clear that one or other of these thing will mitig in some degre mani difficulti nevertheless he who has reli least on fortun is establish the strongest further it facilit matter when the princ have no other state is compel to resid there in person but to come to those who by their own abil and not through fortun have risen to be princ i say that mose cyrus romulus theseus and such like are the most excel exampl and although one may not discuss mose he have been a mere executor of the will of god yet he ought to be admir if onli for that favour which made him worthi to speak with god but in consid cyrus and other who have acquir or found kingdom all will be found admir and if their particular deed and conduct shall be consid they will not be found inferior to those of mose although he had so great a preceptor and in examin their action and live one cannot see that they owe anyth to fortun beyond opportun which brought them the materi to mould into the form which seem best to them without that opportun their power of mind would have been extinguish and without those power the opportun would have come in vain it was necessari therefor to mose that he should find the peopl of israel in egypt enslav and oppress by the egyptian in order that they should be dispos to follow him so as to be deliv out of bondag it was necessari that romulus should not remain in alba and that he should be abandon at his birth in order that he should becom king of rome and founder of the fatherland it was necessari that cyrus should find the persian discont with the govern of the mede and the mede soft and effemin through their long peac theseus could not have shown his abil had he not found the athenian dispers these opportun therefor made those men fortun and their high abil enabl them to recogn the opportun wherebi their countri was ennobl and made famous those who by valor way becom princ like these men acquir a princip with difficulti but they keep it with eas the difficulti they have in acquir it rise in part from the new rule and method which they are forc to introduc to establish their govern and it secur and it ought to be rememb that there is noth more difficult to take in hand more peril to conduct or more uncertain in it success than to take the lead in the introduct of a new order of thing becaus the innov has for enemi all those who have done well under the old condit and lukewarm defend in those who may do well under the new this cool aris part from fear of the oppon who have the law on their side and part from the incredul of men who do not readili believ in new thing until they have had a long experi of them thus it happen that whenev those who are hostil have the opportun to attack they do it like partisan whilst the other defend lukewarm in such wise that the princ is endang along with them it is necessari therefor if we desir to discuss this matter thorough to inquir whether these innov can reli on themselv or have to depend on other that is to say whether to consumm their enterpris have they to use prayer or can they use forc in the first instanc they alway succeed bad and never compass anyth but when they can reli on themselv and use forc then they are rare endang henc it is that all arm prophet have conquer and the unarm one have been destroy besid the reason mention the natur of the peopl is variabl and whilst it is easi to persuad them it is difficult to fix them in that persuas and thus it is necessari to take such measur that when they believ no longer it may be possibl to make them believ by forc if mose cyrus theseus and romulus had been unarm they could not have enforc their constitut for longa happen in our time to fra girolamo savonarola who was ruin with his new order of thing immedi the multitud believ in him no longer and he had no mean of keep steadfast those who believ or of make the unbeliev to believ therefor such as these have great difficulti in consumm their enterpris for all their danger are in the ascent yet with abil they will overcom them but when these are overcom and those who envi them their success are extermin they will begin to be respect and they will continu afterward power secur honour and happi to these great exampl i wish to add a lesser one still it bear some resembl to them and i wish it to suffic me for all of a like kind it is hiero the syracusan this man rose from a privat station to be princ of syracus nor did he either owe anyth to fortun but opportun for the syracusan be oppress chose him for their captain afterward he was reward by be made their princ he was of so great abil even as a privat citizen that one who write of him say he want noth but a kingdom to be a king this man abolish the old soldieri organ the new gave up old allianc made new one and as he had his own soldier and alli on such foundat he was abl to build ani edific thus whilst he had endur much troubl in acquir he had but littl in keep hiero ii born about 307 bc die 216 bc chapter vii concern new princip which are acquir either by the arm of other or by good fortun those who sole by good fortun becom princ from be privat citizen have littl troubl in rise but much in keep atop they have not ani difficulti on the way up becaus they fli but they have mani when they reach the summit such are those to whom some state is given either for money or by the favour of him who bestow it as happen to mani in greec in the citi of ionia and of the hellespont where princ were made by darius in order that they might hold the citi both for his secur and his glori as also were those emperor who by the corrupt of the soldier from be citizen came to empir such stand simpli elev upon the goodwil and the fortun of him who has elev themtwo most inconst and unstabl thing neither have they the knowledg requisit for the posit becaus unless they are men of great worth and abil it is not reason to expect that they should know how to command have alway live in a privat condit besid they cannot hold it becaus they have not forc which they can keep friend and faith state that rise unexpect then like all other thing in natur which are born and grow rapid cannot leav their foundat and correspond fix in such a way that the first storm will not overthrow them unless as is said those who unexpect becom princ are men of so much abil that they know they have to be prepar at onc to hold that which fortun has thrown into their lap and that those foundat which other have laid befor they becam princ they must lay afterward le radici e corrispondenz their root ie foundat and correspond or relat with other statesa common mean of correspond and correspond in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuri concern these two method of rise to be a princ by abil or fortun i wish to adduc two exampl within our own recollect and these are francesco sforza and cesar borgia francesco by proper mean and with great abil from be a privat person rose to be duke of milan and that which he had acquir with a thousand anxieti he kept with littl troubl on the other hand cesar borgia call by the peopl duke valentino acquir his state dure the ascend of his father and on it declin he lost it notwithstand that he had taken everi measur and done all that ought to be done by a wise and abl man to fix firm his root in the state which the arm and fortun of other had bestow on him francesco sforza born 1401 die 1466 he marri bianca maria visconti a natur daughter of filippo visconti the duke of milan on whose death he procur his own elev to the duchi machiavelli was the accredit agent of the florentin republ to cesar borgia 1478 1507 dure the transact which led up to the assassin of the orsini and vitelli at sinigalia and along with his letter to his chief in florenc he has left an account written ten year befor the princ of the proceed of the duke in his descrition del modo tenuto dal duca valentino nello ammazzar vitellozzo vitelli etc a translat of which is append to the present work becaus as is state abov he who has not first laid his foundat may be abl with great abil to lay them afterward but they will be laid with troubl to the architect and danger to the build if therefor all the step taken by the duke be consid it will be seen that he laid solid foundat for his futur power and i do not consid it superflu to discuss them becaus i do not know what better precept to give a new princ than the exampl of his action and if his disposit were of no avail that was not his fault but the extraordinari and extrem malign of fortun alexand the sixth in wish to aggrand the duke his son had mani immedi and prospect difficulti first he did not see his way to make him master of ani state that was not a state of the church and if he was will to rob the church he knew that the duke of milan and the venetian would not consent becaus faenza and rimini were alreadi under the protect of the venetian besid this he saw the arm of itali especi those by which he might have been assist in hand that would fear the aggrandiz of the pope name the orsini and the colonnesi and their follow it behov him therefor to upset this state of affair and embroil the power so as to make himself secur master of part of their state this was easi for him to do becaus he found the venetian move by other reason inclin to bring back the french into itali he would not onli not oppos this but he would render it more easi by dissolv the former marriag of king loui therefor the king came into itali with the assist of the venetian and the consent of alexand he was no sooner in milan than the pope had soldier from him for the attempt on the romagna which yield to him on the reput of the king the duke therefor have acquir the romagna and beaten the colonnesi while wish to hold that and to advanc further was hinder by two thing the one his forc did not appear loyal to him the other the goodwil of franc that is to say he fear that the forc of the orsini which he was use would not stand to him that not onli might they hinder him from win more but might themselv seiz what he had won and that the king might also do the same of the orsini he had a warn when after take faenza and attack bologna he saw them go veri unwil to that attack and as to the king he learn his mind when he himself after take the duchi of urbino attack tuscani and the king made him desist from that undertak henc the duke decid to depend no more upon the arm and the luck of other for the first thing he weaken the orsini and colonnesi parti in rome by gain to himself all their adher who were gentlemen make them his gentlemen give them good pay and accord to their rank honour them with offic and command in such a way that in a few month all attach to the faction was destroy and turn entir to the duke after this he await an opportun to crush the orsini have scatter the adher of the colonna hous this came to him soon and he use it well for the orsini perceiv at length that the aggrandiz of the duke and the church was ruin to them call a meet of the magion in perugia from this sprung the rebellion at urbino and the tumult in the romagna with endless danger to the duke all of which he overcam with the help of the french have restor his author not to leav it at risk by trust either to the french or other outsid forc he had recours to his wile and he knew so well how to conceal his mind that by the mediat of signor pagolowhom the duke did not fail to secur with all kind of attent give him money apparel and horsesth orsini were reconcil so that their simplic brought them into his power at sinigalia have extermin the leader and turn their partisan into his friend the duke laid suffici good foundat to his power have all the romagna and the duchi of urbino and the peopl now begin to appreci their prosper he gain them all over to himself and as this point is worthi of notic and to be imit by other i am not will to leav it out sinigalia 31st decemb 1502 when the duke occupi the romagna he found it under the rule of weak master who rather plunder their subject than rule them and gave them more caus for disunion than for union so that the countri was full of robberi quarrel and everi kind of violenc and so wish to bring back peac and obedi to author he consid it necessari to give it a good governor thereupon he promot messer ramiro dorco a swift and cruel man to whom he gave the fullest power this man in a short time restor peac and uniti with the greatest success afterward the duke consid that it was not advis to confer such excess author for he had no doubt but that he would becom odious so he set up a court of judgment in the countri under a most excel presid wherein all citi had their advoc and becaus he knew that the past sever had caus some hatr against himself so to clear himself in the mind of the peopl and gain them entir to himself he desir to show that if ani cruelti had been practis it had not origin with him but in the natur stern of the minist under this pretenc he took ramiro and one morn caus him to be execut and left on the piazza at cesena with the block and a bloodi knife at his side the barbar of this spectacl caus the peopl to be at onc satisfi and dismay ramiro dorco ramiro de lorqua but let us return whenc we start i say that the duke find himself now suffici power and part secur from immedi danger by have arm himself in his own way and have in a great measur crush those forc in his vicin that could injur him if he wish to proceed with his conquest had next to consid franc for he knew that the king who too late was awar of his mistak would not support him and from this time he began to seek new allianc and to tempor with franc in the expedit which she was make toward the kingdom of napl against the spaniard who were besieg gaeta it was his intent to secur himself against them and this he would have quick accomplish had alexand live such was his line of action as to present affair but as to the futur he had to fear in the first place that a new successor to the church might not be friend to him and might seek to take from him that which alexand had given him so he decid to act in four way first by extermin the famili of those lord whom he had despoil so as to take away that pretext from the pope second by win to himself all the gentlemen of rome so as to be abl to curb the pope with their aid as has been observ third by convert the colleg more to himself fourth by acquir so much power befor the pope should die that he could by his own measur resist the first shock of these four thing at the death of alexand he had accomplish three for he had kill as mani of the dispossess lord as he could lay hand on and few had escap he had won over the roman gentlemen and he had the most numer parti in the colleg and as to ani fresh acquisit he intend to becom master of tuscani for he alreadi possess perugia and piombino and pisa was under his protect and as he had no longer to studi franc for the french were alreadi driven out of the kingdom of napl by the spaniard and in this way both were compel to buy his goodwil he pounc down upon pisa after this lucca and siena yield at onc part through hatr and part through fear of the florentin and the florentin would have had no remedi had he continu to prosper as he was prosper the year that alexand die for he had acquir so much power and reput that he would have stood by himself and no longer have depend on the luck and the forc of other but sole on his own power and abil but alexand die five year after he had first drawn the sword he left the duke with the state of romagna alon consolid with the rest in the air between two most power hostil armi and sick unto death yet there were in the duke such bold and abil and he knew so well how men are to be won or lost and so firm were the foundat which in so short a time he had laid that if he had not had those armi on his back or if he had been in good health he would have overcom all difficulti and it is seen that his foundat were good for the romagna await him for more than a month in rome although but half aliv he remain secur and whilst the baglioni the vitelli and the orsini might come to rome they could not effect anyth against him if he could not have made pope him whom he wish at least the one whom he did not wish would not have been elect but if he had been in sound health at the death of alexand everyth would have been differ to him on the day that julius the second+ was elect he told me that he had thought of everyth that might occur at the death of his father and had provid a remedi for all except that he had never anticip that when the death did happen he himself would be on the point to die alexand vi die of fever 18th august 1503 + julius ii was giuliano della rover cardin of san pietro ad vincula born 1443 die 1513 when all the action of the duke are recal i do not know how to blame him but rather it appear to be as i have said that i ought to offer him for imit to all those who by the fortun or the arm of other are rais to govern becaus he have a lofti spirit and far reach aim could not have regul his conduct otherwis and onli the short of the life of alexand and his own sick frustrat his design therefor he who consid it necessari to secur himself in his new princip to win friend to overcom either by forc or fraud to make himself belov and fear by the peopl to be follow and rever by the soldier to extermin those who have power or reason to hurt him to chang the old order of thing for new to be sever and gracious magnanim and liber to destroy a disloy soldieri and to creat new to maintain friendship with king and princ in such a way that they must help him with zeal and offend with caution cannot find a more live exampl than the action of this man onli can he be blame for the elect of julius the second in whom he made a bad choic becaus as is said not be abl to elect a pope to his own mind he could have hinder ani other from be elect pope and he ought never to have consent to the elect of ani cardin whom he had injur or who had caus to fear him if they becam pontiff for men injur either from fear or hatr those whom he had injur amongst other were san pietro ad vincula colonna san giorgio and ascanio the rest in becom pope had to fear him rouen and the spaniard except the latter from their relationship and oblig the former from his influenc the kingdom of franc have relat with him therefor abov everyth the duke ought to have creat a spaniard pope and fail him he ought to have consent to rouen and not san pietro ad vincula he who believ that new benefit will caus great personag to forget old injuri is deceiv therefor the duke er in his choic and it was the caus of his ultim ruin san giorgio is raffaello riario ascanio is ascanio sforza chapter viii concern those who have obtain a princip by wicked although a princ may rise from a privat station in two way neither of which can be entir attribut to fortun or genius yet it is manifest to me that i must not be silent on them although one could be more copious treat when i discuss republ these method are when either by some wick or nefari way one ascend to the princip or when by the favour of his fellow citizen a privat person becom the princ of his countri and speak of the first method it will be illustr by two exampleson ancient the other modernand without enter further into the subject i consid these two exampl will suffic those who may be compel to follow them agathocl the sicilian becam king of syracus not onli from a privat but from a low and abject posit this man the son of a potter through all the chang in his fortun alway led an infam life nevertheless he accompani his infami with so much abil of mind and bodi that have devot himself to the militari profess he rose through it rank to be praetor of syracus be establish in that posit and have deliber resolv to make himself princ and to seiz by violenc without oblig to other that which had been conced to him by assent he came to an understand for this purpos with amilcar the carthaginian who with his armi was fight in sicili one morn he assembl the peopl and the senat of syracus as if he had to discuss with them thing relat to the republ and at a given signal the soldier kill all the senat and the richest of the peopl these dead he seiz and held the princedom of that citi without ani civil commot and although he was twice rout by the carthaginian and ultim besieg yet not onli was he abl to defend his citi but leav part of his men for it defenc with the other he attack africa and in a short time rais the sieg of syracus the carthaginian reduc to extrem necess were compel to come to term with agathocl and leav sicili to him had to be content with the possess of africa agathocl the sicilian born 361 bc die 289 bc therefor he who consid the action and the genius of this man will see noth or littl which can be attribut to fortun inasmuch as he attain pre emin as is shown abov not by the favour of ani one but step by step in the militari profess which step were gain with a thousand troubl and peril and were afterward bold held by him with mani hazard danger yet it cannot be call talent to slay fellow citizen to deceiv friend to be without faith without merci without religion such method may gain empir but not glori still if the courag of agathocl in enter into and extric himself from danger be consid togeth with his great of mind in endur and overcom hardship it cannot be seen whi he should be esteem less than the most notabl captain nevertheless his barbar cruelti and inhuman with infinit wicked do not permit him to be celebr among the most excel men what he achiev cannot be attribut either to fortun or genius in our time dure the rule of alexand the sixth oliverotto da fermo have been left an orphan mani year befor was brought up by his matern uncl giovanni fogliani and in the earli day of his youth sent to fight under pagolo vitelli that be train under his disciplin he might attain some high posit in the militari profess after pagolo die he fought under his brother vitellozzo and in a veri short time be endow with wit and a vigor bodi and mind he becam the first man in his profess but it appear a paltri thing to serv under other he resolv with the aid of some citizen of fermo to whom the slaveri of their countri was dearer than it liberti and with the help of the vitelleschi to seiz fermo so he wrote to giovanni fogliani that have been away from home for mani year he wish to visit him and his citi and in some measur to look upon his patrimoni and although he had not labour to acquir anyth except honour yet in order that the citizen should see he had not spent his time in vain he desir to come honour so would be accompani by one hundr horsemen his friend and retain and he entreat giovanni to arrang that he should be receiv honour by the fermian all of which would be not onli to his honour but also to that of giovanni himself who had brought him up giovanni therefor did not fail in ani attent due to his nephew and he caus him to be honour receiv by the fermian and he lodg him in his own hous where have pass some day and have arrang what was necessari for his wick design oliverotto gave a solemn banquet to which he invit giovanni fogliani and the chief of fermo when the viand and all the other entertain that are usual in such banquet were finish oliverotto art began certain grave discours speak of the great of pope alexand and his son cesar and of their enterpris to which discours giovanni and other answer but he rose at onc say that such matter ought to be discuss in a more privat place and he betook himself to a chamber whither giovanni and the rest of the citizen went in after him no sooner were they seat than soldier issu from secret place and slaughter giovanni and the rest after these murder oliverotto mount on horseback rode up and down the town and besieg the chief magistr in the palac so that in fear the peopl were forc to obey him and to form a govern of which he made himself the princ he kill all the malcont who were abl to injur him and strengthen himself with new civil and militari ordin in such a way that in the year dure which he held the princip not onli was he secur in the citi of fermo but he had becom formid to all his neighbour and his destruct would have been as difficult as that of agathocl if he had not allow himself to be overreach by cesar borgia who took him with the orsini and vitelli at sinigalia as was state abov thus one year after he had commit this parricid he was strangl togeth with vitellozzo whom he had made his leader in valour and wicked some may wonder how it can happen that agathocl and his like after infinit treacheri and cruelti should live for long secur in his countri and defend himself from extern enemi and never be conspir against by his own citizen see that mani other by mean of cruelti have never been abl even in peac time to hold the state still less in the doubt time of war i believ that this follow from sever be bad or proper use those may be call proper use if of evil it is possibl to speak well that are appli at one blow and are necessari to one secur and that are not persist in afterward unless they can be turn to the advantag of the subject the bad employ are those which notwithstand they may be few in the commenc multipli with time rather than decreas those who practis the first system are abl by aid of god or man to mitig in some degre their rule as agathocl did it is imposs for those who follow the other to maintain themselv mr burd suggest that this word probabl come near the modern equival of machiavelli thought when he speak of crudelta than the more obvious cruelti henc it is to be remark that in seiz a state the usurp ought to examin close into all those injuri which it is necessari for him to inflict and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them daili and thus by not unsettl men he will be abl to reassur them and win them to himself by benefit he who doe otherwis either from timid or evil advic is alway compel to keep the knife in his hand neither can he reli on his subject nor can they attach themselv to him owe to their continu and repeat wrong for injuri ought to be done all at one time so that be tast less they offend less benefit ought to be given littl by littl so that the flavour of them may last longer and abov all thing a princ ought to live amongst his peopl in such a way that no unexpect circumst whether of good or evil shall make him chang becaus if the necess for this come in troubl time you are too late for harsh measur and mild one will not help you for they will be consid as forc from you and no one will be under ani oblig to you for them chapter ix concern a civil princip but come to the other pointwher a lead citizen becom the princ of his countri not by wicked or ani intoler violenc but by the favour of his fellow citizensthi may be call a civil princip nor is genius or fortun altogeth necessari to attain to it but rather a happi shrewd i say then that such a princip is obtain either by the favour of the peopl or by the favour of the nobl becaus in all citi these two distinct parti are found and from this it aris that the peopl do not wish to be rule nor oppress by the nobl and the nobl wish to rule and oppress the peopl and from these two opposit desir there aris in citi one of three result either a princip self govern or anarchi a princip is creat either by the peopl or by the nobl accord as one or other of them has the opportun for the nobl see they cannot withstand the peopl begin to cri up the reput of one of themselv and they make him a princ so that under his shadow they can give vent to their ambit the peopl find they cannot resist the nobl also cri up the reput of one of themselv and make him a princ so as to be defend by his author he who obtain sovereignti by the assist of the nobl maintain himself with more difficulti than he who come to it by the aid of the peopl becaus the former find himself with mani around him who consid themselv his equal and becaus of this he can neither rule nor manag them to his like but he who reach sovereignti by popular favour find himself alon and has none around him or few who are not prepar to obey him besid this one cannot by fair deal and without injuri to other satisfi the nobl but you can satisfi the peopl for their object is more righteous than that of the nobl the latter wish to oppress while the former onli desir not to be oppress it is to be ad also that a princ can never secur himself against a hostil peopl becaus of their be too mani whilst from the nobl he can secur himself as they are few in number the worst that a princ may expect from a hostil peopl is to be abandon by them but from hostil nobl he has not onli to fear abandon but also that they will rise against him for they be in these affair more far see and astut alway come forward in time to save themselv and to obtain favour from him whom they expect to prevail further the princ is compel to live alway with the same peopl but he can do well without the same nobl be abl to make and unmak them daili and to give or take away author when it pleas him therefor to make this point clearer i say that the nobl ought to be look at main in two way that is to say they either shape their cours in such a way as bind them entir to your fortun or they do not those who so bind themselv and are not rapaci ought to be honour and love those who do not bind themselv may be dealt with in two way they may fail to do this through pusillanim and a natur want of courag in which case you ought to make use of them especi of those who are of good counsel and thus whilst in prosper you honour them in advers you do not have to fear them but when for their own ambiti end they shun bind themselv it is a token that they are give more thought to themselv than to you and a princ ought to guard against such and to fear them as if they were open enemi becaus in advers they alway help to ruin him therefor one who becom a princ through the favour of the peopl ought to keep them friend and this he can easili do see they onli ask not to be oppress by him but one who in opposit to the peopl becom a princ by the favour of the nobl ought abov everyth to seek to win the peopl over to himself and this he may easili do if he take them under his protect becaus men when they receiv good from him of whom they were expect evil are bound more close to their benefactor thus the peopl quick becom more devot to him than if he had been rais to the princip by their favour and the princ can win their affect in mani way but as these vari accord to the circumst one cannot give fix rule so i omit them but i repeat it is necessari for a princ to have the peopl friend otherwis he has no secur in advers nabi princ of the spartan sustain the attack of all greec and of a victori roman armi and against them he defend his countri and his govern and for the overcom of this peril it was onli necessari for him to make himself secur against a few but this would not have been suffici had the peopl been hostil and do not let ani one impugn this statement with the trite proverb that he who build on the peopl build on the mud for this is true when a privat citizen make a foundat there and persuad himself that the peopl will free him when he is oppress by his enemi or by the magistr wherein he would find himself veri often deceiv as happen to the gracchi in rome and to messer giorgio scali+ in florenc but grant a princ who has establish himself as abov who can command and is a man of courag undismay in advers who doe not fail in other qualif and who by his resolut and energi keep the whole peopl encouragedsuch a one will never find himself deceiv in them and it will be shown that he has laid his foundat well nabi tyrant of sparta conquer by the roman under flamininus in 195 bc kill 192 bc + messer giorgio scali this event is to be found in machiavelli florentin histori book iii these princip are liabl to danger when they are pass from the civil to the absolut order of govern for such princ either rule person or through magistr in the latter case their govern is weaker and more insecur becaus it rest entir on the goodwil of those citizen who are rais to the magistraci and who especi in troubl time can destroy the govern with great eas either by intrigu or open defianc and the princ has not the chanc amid tumult to exercis absolut author becaus the citizen and subject accustom to receiv order from magistr are not of a mind to obey him amid these confus and there will alway be in doubt time a scarciti of men whom he can trust for such a princ cannot reli upon what he observ in quiet time when citizen have need of the state becaus then everi one agre with him they all promis and when death is far distant they all wish to die for him but in troubl time when the state has need of it citizen then he find but few and so much the more is this experi danger inasmuch as it can onli be tri onc therefor a wise princ ought to adopt such a cours that his citizen will alway in everi sort and kind of circumst have need of the state and of him and then he will alway find them faith chapter x concern the way in which the strength of all princip ought to be measur it is necessari to consid anoth point in examin the charact of these princip that is whether a princ has such power that in case of need he can support himself with his own resourc or whether he has alway need of the assist of other and to make this quit clear i say that i consid those who are abl to support themselv by their own resourc who can either by abund of men or money rais a suffici armi to join battl against ani one who come to attack them and i consid those alway to have need of other who cannot show themselv against the enemi in the field but are forc to defend themselv by shelter behind wall the first case has been discuss but we will speak of it again should it recur in the second case one can say noth except to encourag such princ to provis and fortifi their town and not on ani account to defend the countri and whoever shall fortifi his town well and shall have manag the other concern of his subject in the way state abov and to be often repeat will never be attack without great caution for men are alway advers to enterpris where difficulti can be seen and it will be seen not to be an easi thing to attack one who has his town well fortifi and is not hate by his peopl the citi of germani are absolut free they own but littl countri around them and they yield obedi to the emperor when it suit them nor do they fear this or ani other power they may have near them becaus they are fortifi in such a way that everi one think the take of them by assault would be tedious and difficult see they have proper ditch and wall they have suffici artilleri and they alway keep in public depot enough for one year eat drink and fire and beyond this to keep the peopl quiet and without loss to the state they alway have the mean of give work to the communiti in those labour that are the life and strength of the citi and on the pursuit of which the peopl are support they also hold militari exercis in reput and moreov have mani ordin to uphold them therefor a princ who has a strong citi and had not made himself odious will not be attack or if ani one should attack he will onli be driven off with disgrac again becaus that the affair of this world are so changeabl it is almost imposs to keep an armi a whole year in the field without be interf with and whoever should repli if the peopl have properti outsid the citi and see it burnt they will not remain patient and the long sieg and self interest will make them forget their princ to this i answer that a power and courag princ will overcom all such difficulti by give at one time hope to his subject that the evil will not be for long at anoth time fear of the cruelti of the enemi then preserv himself adroit from those subject who seem to him to be too bold further the enemi would natur on his arriv at onc burn and ruin the countri at the time when the spirit of the peopl are still hot and readi for the defenc and therefor so much the less ought the princ to hesit becaus after a time when spirit have cool the damag is alreadi done the ill are incur and there is no longer ani remedi and therefor they are so much the more readi to unit with their princ he appear to be under oblig to them now that their hous have been burnt and their possess ruin in his defenc for it is the natur of men to be bound by the benefit they confer as much as by those they receiv therefor if everyth is well consid it will not be difficult for a wise princ to keep the mind of his citizen steadfast from first to last when he doe not fail to support and defend them chapter xi concern ecclesiast princip it onli remain now to speak of ecclesiast princip touch which all difficulti are prior to get possess becaus they are acquir either by capac or good fortun and they can be held without either for they are sustain by the ancient ordin of religion which are so all power and of such a charact that the princip may be held no matter how their princ behav and live these princ alon have state and do not defend them and they have subject and do not rule them and the state although unguard are not taken from them and the subject although not rule do not care and they have neither the desir nor the abil to alien themselv such princip onli are secur and happi but be upheld by power to which the human mind cannot reach i shall speak no more of them becaus be exalt and maintain by god it would be the act of a presumptu and rash man to discuss them nevertheless if ani one should ask of me how come it that the church has attain such great in tempor power see that from alexand backward the italian potent not onli those who have been call potent but everi baron and lord though the smallest have valu the tempor power veri slightlyyet now a king of franc trembl befor it and it has been abl to drive him from itali and to ruin the venetiansalthough this may be veri manifest it doe not appear to me superflu to recal it in some measur to memori befor charl king of franc pass into itali this countri was under the dominion of the pope the venetian the king of napl the duke of milan and the florentin these potent had two princip anxieti the one that no foreign should enter itali under arm the other that none of themselv should seiz more territori those about whom there was the most anxieti were the pope and the venetian to restrain the venetian the union of all the other was necessari as it was for the defenc of ferrara and to keep down the pope they made use of the baron of rome who be divid into two faction orsini and colonnesi had alway a pretext for disord and stand with arm in their hand under the eye of the pontiff kept the pontif weak and powerless and although there might aris sometim a courag pope such as sixtus yet neither fortun nor wisdom could rid him of these annoy and the short life of a pope is also a caus of weak for in the ten year which is the averag life of a pope he can with difficulti lower one of the faction and if so to speak one peopl should almost destroy the colonnesi anoth would aris hostil to the orsini who would support their oppon and yet would not have time to ruin the orsini this was the reason whi the tempor power of the pope were littl esteem in itali charl viii invad itali in 1494 alexand the sixth aros afterward who of all the pontiff that have ever been show how a pope with both money and arm was abl to prevail and through the instrument of the duke valentino and by reason of the entri of the french he brought about all those thing which i have discuss abov in the action of the duke and although his intent was not to aggrand the church but the duke nevertheless what he did contribut to the great of the church which after his death and the ruin of the duke becam the heir to all his labour pope julius came afterward and found the church strong possess all the romagna the baron of rome reduc to impot and through the chastis of alexand the faction wipe out he also found the way open to accumul money in a manner such as had never been practis befor alexand time such thing julius not onli follow but improv upon and he intend to gain bologna to ruin the venetian and to drive the french out of itali all of these enterpris prosper with him and so much the more to his credit inasmuch as he did everyth to strengthen the church and not ani privat person he kept also the orsini and colonnesi faction within the bound in which he found them and although there was among them some mind to make disturb nevertheless he held two thing firm the one the great of the church with which he terrifi them and the other not allow them to have their own cardin who caus the disord among them for whenev these faction have their cardin they do not remain quiet for long becaus cardin foster the faction in rome and out of it and the baron are compel to support them and thus from the ambit of prelat aris disord and tumult among the baron for these reason his holi pope leo found the pontif most power and it is to be hope that if other made it great in arm he will make it still greater and more vener by his good and infinit other virtu pope leo x was the cardin de medici chapter xii how mani kind of soldieri there are and concern mercenari have discours particular on the characterist of such princip as in the begin i propos to discuss and have consid in some degre the caus of their be good or bad and have shown the method by which mani have sought to acquir them and to hold them it now remain for me to discuss general the mean of offenc and defenc which belong to each of them we have seen abov how necessari it is for a princ to have his foundat well laid otherwis it follow of necess he will go to ruin the chief foundat of all state new as well as old or composit are good law and good arm and as there cannot be good law where the state is not well arm it follow that where they are well arm they have good law i shall leav the law out of the discuss and shall speak of the arm i say therefor that the arm with which a princ defend his state are either his own or they are mercenari auxiliari or mix mercenari and auxiliari are useless and danger and if one hold his state base on these arm he will stand neither firm nor safe for they are disunit ambiti and without disciplin unfaith valiant befor friend coward befor enemi they have neither the fear of god nor fidel to men and destruct is defer onli so long as the attack is for in peac one is rob by them and in war by the enemi the fact is they have no other attract or reason for keep the field than a trifl of stipend which is not suffici to make them will to die for you they are readi enough to be your soldier whilst you do not make war but if war come they take themselv off or run from the foe which i should have littl troubl to prove for the ruin of itali has been caus by noth els than by rest all her hope for mani year on mercenari and although they former made some display and appear valiant amongst themselv yet when the foreign came they show what they were thus it was that charl king of franc was allow to seiz itali with chalk in hand and he who told us that our sin were the caus of it told the truth but they were not the sin he imagin but those which i have relat and as they were the sin of princ it is the princ who have also suffer the penalti with chalk in hand col gesso this is one of the bon mot of alexand vi and refer to the eas with which charl viii seiz itali impli that it was onli necessari for him to send his quartermast to chalk up the billet for his soldier to conquer the countri cf the histori of henri vii by lord bacon king charl had conquer the realm of napl and lost it again in a kind of a felic of a dream he pass the whole length of itali without resist so that it was true what pope alexand was wont to say that the frenchmen came into itali with chalk in their hand to mark up their lodg rather than with sword to fight i wish to demonstr further the infel of these arm the mercenari captain are either capabl men or they are not if they are you cannot trust them becaus they alway aspir to their own great either by oppress you who are their master or other contrari to your intent but if the captain is not skil you are ruin in the usual way and if it be urg that whoever is arm will act in the same way whether mercenari or not i repli that when arm have to be resort to either by a princ or a republ then the princ ought to go in person and perform the duti of a captain the republ has to send it citizen and when one is sent who doe not turn out satisfactorili it ought to recal him and when one is worthi to hold him by the law so that he doe not leav the command and experi has shown princ and republ singl hand make the greatest progress and mercenari do noth except damag and it is more difficult to bring a republ arm with it own arm under the sway of one of it citizen than it is to bring one arm with foreign arm rome and sparta stood for mani age arm and free the switzer are complet arm and quit free of ancient mercenari for exampl there are the carthaginian who were oppress by their mercenari soldier after the first war with the roman although the carthaginian had their own citizen for captain after the death of epaminonda philip of macedon was made captain of their soldier by the theban and after victori he took away their liberti duke filippo be dead the milanes enlist francesco sforza against the venetian and he have overcom the enemi at caravaggio alli himself with them to crush the milanes his master his father sforza have been engag by queen johanna+ of napl left her unprotect so that she was forc to throw herself into the arm of the king of aragon in order to save her kingdom and if the venetian and florentin former extend their dominion by these arm and yet their captain did not make themselv princ but have defend them i repli that the florentin in this case have been favour by chanc for of the abl captain of whom they might have stood in fear some have not conquer some have been oppos and other have turn their ambit elsewher one who did not conquer was giovanni acuto and sinc he did not conquer his fidel cannot be prove but everi one will acknowledg that had he conquer the florentin would have stood at his discret sforza had the bracceschi alway against him so they watch each other francesco turn his ambit to lombardi braccio against the church and the kingdom of napl but let us come to that which happen a short while ago the florentin appoint as their captain pagolo vitelli a most prudent man who from a privat posit had risen to the greatest renown if this man had taken pisa nobodi can deni that it would have been proper for the florentin to keep in with him for if he becam the soldier of their enemi they had no mean of resist and if they held to him they must obey him the venetian if their achiev are consid will be seen to have act safe and glorious so long as they sent to war their own men when with arm gentlemen and plebian they did valiant this was befor they turn to enterpris on land but when they began to fight on land they forsook this virtu and follow the custom of itali and in the begin of their expans on land through not have much territori and becaus of their great reput they had not much to fear from their captain but when they expand as under carmignuola they had a tast of this mistak for have found him a most valiant man they beat the duke of milan under his leadership and on the other hand know how lukewarm he was in the war they fear they would no longer conquer under him and for this reason they were not will nor were they abl to let him go and so not to lose again that which they had acquir they were compel in order to secur themselv to murder him they had afterward for their captain bartolomeo da bergamo roberto da san severino the count of pitiglianoand and the like under whom they had to dread loss and not gain as happen afterward at vaila where in one battl they lost that which in eight hundr year they had acquir with so much troubl becaus from such arm conquest come but slowli long delay and inconsider but the loss sudden and portent battl of caravaggio 15th septemb 1448 + johanna ii of napl the widow of ladislao king of napl giovanni acuto an english knight whose name was sir john hawkwood he fought in the english war in franc and was knight by edward iii afterward he collect a bodi of troop and went into itali these becam the famous white compani he took part in mani war and die in florenc in 1394 he was born about 1320 at sibl hedingham a villag in essex he marri domnia a daughter of bernabo visconti carmignuola francesco busson born at carmagnola about 1390 execut at venic 5th may 1432 and bartolomeo colleoni of bergamo die 1457 roberto of san severino die fight for venic against sigismund duke of austria in 1487 primo capitano in italia machiavelli count of pitigliano nicolo orsini born 1442 die 1510 battl of vaila in 1509 and as with these exampl i have reach itali which has been rule for mani year by mercenari i wish to discuss them more serious in order that have seen their rise and progress one may be better prepar to counteract them you must understand that the empir has recent come to be repudi in itali that the pope has acquir more tempor power and that itali has been divid up into more state for the reason that mani of the great citi took up arm against their nobl who former favour by the emperor were oppress them whilst the church was favour them so as to gain author in tempor power in mani other their citizen becam princ from this it came to pass that itali fell part into the hand of the church and of republ and the church consist of priest and the republ of citizen unaccustom to arm both commenc to enlist foreign the first who gave renown to this soldieri was alberigo da conio the romagnian from the school of this man sprang among other braccio and sforza who in their time were the arbit of itali after these came all the other captain who till now have direct the arm of itali and the end of all their valour has been that she has been overrun by charl rob by loui ravag by ferdinand and insult by the switzer the principl that has guid them has been first to lower the credit of infantri so that they might increas their own they did this becaus subsist on their pay and without territori they were unabl to support mani soldier and a few infantri did not give them ani author so they were led to employ cavalri with a moder forc of which they were maintain and honour and affair were brought to such a pass that in an armi of twenti thousand soldier there were not to be found two thousand foot soldier they had besid this use everi art to lessen fatigu and danger to themselv and their soldier not kill in the fray but take prison and liber without ransom they did not attack town at night nor did the garrison of the town attack encamp at night they did not surround the camp either with stockad or ditch nor did they campaign in the winter all these thing were permit by their militari rule and devis by them to avoid as i have said both fatigu and danger thus they have brought itali to slaveri and contempt alberigo da conio alberico da barbiano count of cunio in romagna he was the leader of the famous compani of st georg compos entir of italian soldier he die in 1409 chapter xiii concern auxiliari mix soldieri and one own auxiliari which are the other useless arm are employ when a princ is call in with his forc to aid and defend as was done by pope julius in the most recent time for he have in the enterpris against ferrara had poor proof of his mercenari turn to auxiliari and stipul with ferdinand king of spain for his assist with men and arm these arm may be use and good in themselv but for him who call them in they are alway disadvantag for lose one is undon and win one is their captiv ferdinand v f ii of aragon and sicili f iii of napl surnam the cathol born 1542 die 1516 and although ancient histori may be full of exampl i do not wish to leav this recent one of pope julius the second the peril of which cannot fail to be perceiv for he wish to get ferrara threw himself entir into the hand of the foreign but his good fortun brought about a third event so that he did not reap the fruit of his rash choic becaus have his auxiliari rout at ravenna and the switzer have risen and driven out the conqueror against all expect both his and other it so came to pass that he did not becom prison to his enemi they have fled nor to his auxiliari he have conquer by other arm than their the florentin be entir without arm sent ten thousand frenchmen to take pisa wherebi they ran more danger than at ani other time of their troubl the emperor of constantinopl to oppos his neighbour sent ten thousand turk into greec who on the war be finish were not will to quit this was the begin of the servitud of greec to the infidel joann cantacuzenus born 1300 die 1383 therefor let him who has no desir to conquer make use of these arm for they are much more hazard than mercenari becaus with them the ruin is readi made they are all unit all yield obedi to other but with mercenari when they have conquer more time and better opportun are need to injur you they are not all of one communiti they are found and paid by you and a third parti which you have made their head is not abl all at onc to assum enough author to injur you in conclus in mercenari dastardi is most danger in auxiliari valour the wise princ therefor has alway avoid these arm and turn to his own and has been will rather to lose with them than to conquer with the other not deem that a real victori which is gain with the arm of other i shall never hesit to cite cesar borgia and his action this duke enter the romagna with auxiliari take there onli french soldier and with them he captur imola and for but afterward such forc not appear to him reliabl he turn to mercenari discern less danger in them and enlist the orsini and vitelli whom present on handl and find them doubt unfaith and danger he destroy and turn to his own men and the differ between one and the other of these forc can easili be seen when one consid the differ there was in the reput of the duke when he had the french when he had the orsini and vitelli and when he reli on his own soldier on whose fidel he could alway count and found it ever increas he was never esteem more high than when everi one saw that he was complet master of his own forc i was not intend to go beyond italian and recent exampl but i am unwil to leav out hiero the syracusan he be one of those i have name abov this man as i have said made head of the armi by the syracusan soon found out that a mercenari soldieri constitut like our italian condottieri was of no use and it appear to him that he could neither keep them not let them go he had them all cut to piec and afterward made war with his own forc and not with alien i wish also to recal to memori an instanc from the old testament applic to this subject david offer himself to saul to fight with goliath the philistin champion and to give him courag saul arm him with his own weapon which david reject as soon as he had them on his back say he could make no use of them and that he wish to meet the enemi with his sling and his knife in conclus the arm of other either fall from your back or they weigh you down or they bind you fast charl the seventh the father of king loui the eleventh+ have by good fortun and valour liber franc from the english recogn the necess of be arm with forc of his own and he establish in his kingdom ordin concern men at arm and infantri afterward his son king loui abolish the infantri and began to enlist the switzer which mistak follow by other is as is now seen a sourc of peril to that kingdom becaus have rais the reput of the switzer he has entir diminish the valu of his own arm for he has destroy the infantri altogeth and his men at arm he has subordin to other for be as they are so accustom to fight along with switzer it doe not appear that they can now conquer without them henc it aris that the french cannot stand against the switzer and without the switzer they do not come off well against other the armi of the french have thus becom mix part mercenari and part nation both of which arm togeth are much better than mercenari alon or auxiliari alon but much inferior to one own forc and this exampl prove it for the kingdom of franc would be unconquer if the ordin of charl had been enlarg or maintain charl vii of franc surnam the victori born 1403 die 1461 + loui xi son of the abov born 1423 die 1483 but the scanti wisdom of man on enter into an affair which look well at first cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it as i have said abov of hectic fever therefor if he who rule a princip cannot recogn evil until they are upon him he is not truli wise and this insight is given to few and if the first disast to the roman empir should be examin it will be found to have commenc onli with the enlist of the goth becaus from that time the vigour of the roman empir began to declin and all that valour which had rais it pass away to other mani speaker to the hous the other night in the debat on the reduct of armament seem to show a most lament ignor of the condit under which the british empir maintain it exist when mr balfour repli to the alleg that the roman empir sank under the weight of it militari oblig he said that this was wholli unhistor he might well have ad that the roman power was at it zenith when everi citizen acknowledg his liabil to fight for the state but that it began to declin as soon as this oblig was no longer recognizedpal mall gazett 15th may 1906 i conclud therefor that no princip is secur without have it own forc on the contrari it is entir depend on good fortun not have the valour which in advers would defend it and it has alway been the opinion and judgment of wise men that noth can be so uncertain or unstabl as fame or power not found on it own strength and one own forc are those which are compos either of subject citizen or depend all other are mercenari or auxiliari and the way to make readi one own forc will be easili found if the rule suggest by me shall be reflect upon and if one will consid how philip the father of alexand the great and mani republ and princ have arm and organ themselv to which rule i entir commit myself chapter xiv that which concern a princ on the subject of the art of war a princ ought to have no other aim or thought nor select anyth els for his studi than war and it rule and disciplin for this is the sole art that belong to him who rule and it is of such forc that it not onli uphold those who are born princ but it often enabl men to rise from a privat station to that rank and on the contrari it is seen that when princ have thought more of eas than of arm they have lost their state and the first caus of your lose it is to neglect this art and what enabl you to acquir a state is to be master of the art francesco sforza through be martial from a privat person becam duke of milan and the son through avoid the hardship and troubl of arm from duke becam privat person for among other evil which be unarm bring you it caus you to be despis and this is one of those ignomini against which a princ ought to guard himself as is shown later on becaus there is noth proportion between the arm and the unarm and it is not reason that he who is arm should yield obedi will to him who is unarm or that the unarm man should be secur among arm servant becaus there be in the one disdain and in the other suspicion it is not possibl for them to work well togeth and therefor a princ who doe not understand the art of war over and abov the other misfortun alreadi mention cannot be respect by his soldier nor can he reli on them he ought never therefor to have out of his thought this subject of war and in peac he should addict himself more to it exercis than in war this he can do in two way the one by action the other by studi as regard action he ought abov all thing to keep his men well organ and drill to follow incess the chase by which he accustom his bodi to hardship and learn someth of the natur of local and get to find out how the mountain rise how the valley open out how the plain lie and to understand the natur of river and marsh and in all this to take the greatest care which knowledg is use in two way first he learn to know his countri and is better abl to undertak it defenc afterward by mean of the knowledg and observ of that local he understand with eas ani other which it may be necessari for him to studi hereaft becaus the hill valley and plain and river and marsh that are for instanc in tuscani have a certain resembl to those of other countri so that with a knowledg of the aspect of one countri one can easili arriv at a knowledg of other and the princ that lack this skill lack the essenti which it is desir that a captain should possess for it teach him to surpris his enemi to select quarter to lead armi to array the battl to besieg town to advantag philopoemen princ of the achaean among other prais which writer have bestow on him is commend becaus in time of peac he never had anyth in his mind but the rule of war and when he was in the countri with friend he often stop and reason with them if the enemi should be upon that hill and we should find ourselv here with our armi with whom would be the advantag how should one best advanc to meet him keep the rank if we should wish to retreat how ought we to pursu and he would set forth to them as he went all the chanc that could befal an armi he would listen to their opinion and state his confirm it with reason so that by these continu discuss there could never aris in time of war ani unexpect circumst that he could not deal with philopoemen the last of the greek born 252 bc die 183 bc but to exercis the intellect the princ should read histori and studi there the action of illustri men to see how they have born themselv in war to examin the caus of their victori and defeat so as to avoid the latter and imit the former and abov all do as an illustri man did who took as an exemplar one who had been prais and famous befor him and whose achiev and deed he alway kept in his mind as it is said alexand the great imit achill caesar alexand scipio cyrus and whoever read the life of cyrus written by xenophon will recogn afterward in the life of scipio how that imit was his glori and how in chastiti affabl human and liber scipio conform to those thing which have been written of cyrus by xenophon a wise princ ought to observ some such rule and never in peac time stand idl but increas his resourc with industri in such a way that they may be avail to him in advers so that if fortun chanc it may find him prepar to resist her blow chapter xv concern thing for which men and especi princ are prais or blame it remain now to see what ought to be the rule of conduct for a princ toward subject and friend and as i know that mani have written on this point i expect i shall be consid presumptu in mention it again especi as in discuss it i shall depart from the method of other peopl but it be my intent to write a thing which shall be use to him who apprehend it it appear to me more appropri to follow up the real truth of the matter than the imagin of it for mani have pictur republ and princip which in fact have never been known or seen becaus how one live is so far distant from how one ought to live that he who neglect what is done for what ought to be done sooner effect his ruin than his preserv for a man who wish to act entir up to his profess of virtu soon meet with what destroy him among so much that is evil henc it is necessari for a princ wish to hold his own to know how to do wrong and to make use of it or not accord to necess therefor put on one side imaginari thing concern a princ and discuss those which are real i say that all men when they are spoken of and chiefli princ for be more high place are remark for some of those qualiti which bring them either blame or prais and thus it is that one is reput liber anoth miser use a tuscan term becaus an avarici person in our languag is still he who desir to possess by robberi whilst we call one miser who depriv himself too much of the use of his own one is reput generous one rapaci one cruel one compassion one faithless anoth faith one effemin and coward anoth bold and brave one affabl anoth haughti one lascivi anoth chast one sincer anoth cun one hard anoth easi one grave anoth frivol one religi anoth unbeliev and the like and i know that everi one will confess that it would be most praiseworthi in a princ to exhibit all the abov qualiti that are consid good but becaus they can neither be entir possess nor observ for human condit do not permit it it is necessari for him to be suffici prudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vice which would lose him his state and also to keep himself if it be possibl from those which would not lose him it but this not be possibl he may with less hesit abandon himself to them and again he need not make himself uneasi at incur a reproach for those vice without which the state can onli be save with difficulti for if everyth is consid care it will be found that someth which look like virtu if follow would be his ruin whilst someth els which look like vice yet follow bring him secur and prosper chapter xvi concern liber and mean commenc then with the first of the abov name characterist i say that it would be well to be reput liber nevertheless liber exercis in a way that doe not bring you the reput for it injur you for if one exercis it honest and as it should be exercis it may not becom known and you will not avoid the reproach of it opposit therefor ani one wish to maintain among men the name of liber is oblig to avoid no attribut of magnific so that a princ thus inclin will consum in such act all his properti and will be compel in the end if he wish to maintain the name of liber to unduli weigh down his peopl and tax them and do everyth he can to get money this will soon make him odious to his subject and becom poor he will be littl valu by ani one thus with his liber have offend mani and reward few he is affect by the veri first troubl and imperil by whatev may be the first danger recogn this himself and wish to draw back from it he run at onc into the reproach of be miser therefor a princ not be abl to exercis this virtu of liber in such a way that it is recogn except to his cost if he is wise he ought not to fear the reput of be mean for in time he will come to be more consid than if liber see that with his economi his revenu are enough that he can defend himself against all attack and is abl to engag in enterpris without burden his peopl thus it come to pass that he exercis liber toward all from whom he doe not take who are numberless and mean toward those to whom he doe not give who are few we have not seen great thing done in our time except by those who have been consid mean the rest have fail pope julius the second was assist in reach the papaci by a reput for liber yet he did not strive afterward to keep it up when he made war on the king of franc and he made mani war without impos ani extraordinari tax on his subject for he suppli his addit expens out of his long thrifti the present king of spain would not have undertaken or conquer in so mani enterpris if he had been reput liber a princ therefor provid that he has not to rob his subject that he can defend himself that he doe not becom poor and abject that he is not forc to becom rapaci ought to hold of littl account a reput for be mean for it is one of those vice which will enabl him to govern and if ani one should say caesar obtain empir by liber and mani other have reach the highest posit by have been liber and by be consid so i answer either you are a princ in fact or in a way to becom one in the first case this liber is danger in the second it is veri necessari to be consid liber and caesar was one of those who wish to becom pre emin in rome but if he had surviv after becom so and had not moder his expens he would have destroy his govern and if ani one should repli mani have been princ and have done great thing with armi who have been consid veri liber i repli either a princ spend that which is his own or his subject or els that of other in the first case he ought to be spare in the second he ought not to neglect ani opportun for liber and to the princ who goe forth with his armi support it by pillag sack and extort handl that which belong to other this liber is necessari otherwis he would not be follow by soldier and of that which is neither your nor your subject you can be a readi giver as were cyrus caesar and alexand becaus it doe not take away your reput if you squander that of other but add to it it is onli squander your own that injur you and there is noth wast so rapid as liber for even whilst you exercis it you lose the power to do so and so becom either poor or despis or els in avoid poverti rapaci and hate and a princ should guard himself abov all thing against be despis and hate and liber lead you to both therefor it is wiser to have a reput for mean which bring reproach without hatr than to be compel through seek a reput for liber to incur a name for rapac which beget reproach with hatr chapter xvii concern cruelti and clemenc and whether it is better to be love than fear come now to the other qualiti mention abov i say that everi princ ought to desir to be consid clement and not cruel nevertheless he ought to take care not to misus this clemenc cesar borgia was consid cruel notwithstand his cruelti reconcil the romagna unifi it and restor it to peac and loyalti and if this be right consid he will be seen to have been much more merci than the florentin peopl who to avoid a reput for cruelti permit pistoia to be destroy therefor a princ so long as he keep his subject unit and loyal ought not to mind the reproach of cruelti becaus with a few exampl he will be more merci than those who through too much merci allow disord to aris from which follow murder or robberi for these are wont to injur the whole peopl whilst those execut which origin with a princ offend the individu onli dure the riot between the cancellieri and panciatichi faction in 1502 and 1503 and of all princ it is imposs for the new princ to avoid the imput of cruelti owe to new state be full of danger henc virgil through the mouth of dido excus the inhuman of her reign owe to it be new say res dura et regni novita me talia cogunt moliri et late fine custod tueri nevertheless he ought to be slow to believ and to act nor should he himself show fear but proceed in a temper manner with prudenc and human so that too much confid may not make him incauti and too much distrust render him intoler against my will my fate a throne unsettl and an infant state bid me defend my realm with all my powr and guard with these sever my shore christoph pitt upon this a question aris whether it be better to be love than fear or fear than love it may be answer that one should wish to be both but becaus it is difficult to unit them in one person it is much safer to be fear than love when of the two either must be dispens with becaus this is to be assert in general of men that they are ungrat fickl fals coward covet and as long as you succeed they are your entir they will offer you their blood properti life and children as is said abov when the need is far distant but when it approach they turn against you and that princ who reli entir on their promis has neglect other precaut is ruin becaus friendship that are obtain by payment and not by great or nobil of mind may inde be earn but they are not secur and in time of need cannot be reli upon and men have less scrupl in offend one who is belov than one who is fear for love is preserv by the link of oblig which owe to the base of men is broken at everi opportun for their advantag but fear preserv you by a dread of punish which never fail nevertheless a princ ought to inspir fear in such a way that if he doe not win love he avoid hatr becaus he can endur veri well be fear whilst he is not hate which will alway be as long as he abstain from the properti of his citizen and subject and from their women but when it is necessari for him to proceed against the life of someon he must do it on proper justif and for manifest caus but abov all thing he must keep his hand off the properti of other becaus men more quick forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimoni besid pretext for take away the properti are never want for he who has onc begun to live by robberi will alway find pretext for seiz what belong to other but reason for take life on the contrari are more difficult to find and sooner laps but when a princ is with his armi and has under control a multitud of soldier then it is quit necessari for him to disregard the reput of cruelti for without it he would never hold his armi unit or dispos to it duti among the wonder deed of hannib this one is enumer that have led an enorm armi compos of mani various race of men to fight in foreign land no dissens aros either among them or against the princ whether in his bad or in his good fortun this aros from noth els than his inhuman cruelti which with his boundless valour made him rever and terribl in the sight of his soldier but without that cruelti his other virtu were not suffici to produc this effect and short sight writer admir his deed from one point of view and from anoth condemn the princip caus of them that it is true his other virtu would not have been suffici for him may be prove by the case of scipio that most excel man not onli of his own time but within the memori of man against whom nevertheless his armi rebel in spain this aros from noth but his too great forbear which gave his soldier more licens than is consist with militari disciplin for this he was upbraid in the senat by fabius maximus and call the corrupt of the roman soldieri the locrian were laid wast by a legat of scipio yet they were not aveng by him nor was the insol of the legat punish owe entir to his easi natur insomuch that someon in the senat wish to excus him said there were mani men who knew much better how not to err than to correct the error of other this disposit if he had been continu in the command would have destroy in time the fame and glori of scipio but he be under the control of the senat this injuri characterist not onli conceal itself but contribut to his glori return to the question of be fear or love i come to the conclus that men love accord to their own will and fear accord to that of the princ a wise princ should establish himself on that which is in his own control and not in that of other he must endeavour onli to avoid hatr as is note chapter xviii concern the way in which princ should keep faith the present chapter has given greater offenc than ani other portion of machiavelli write burd il princip p 297 everi one admit how praiseworthi it is in a princ to keep faith and to live with integr and not with craft nevertheless our experi has been that those princ who have done great thing have held good faith of littl account and have known how to circumv the intellect of men by craft and in the end have overcom those who have reli on their word you must know there are two way of contest the one by the law the other by forc the first method is proper to men the second to beast but becaus the first is frequent not suffici it is necessari to have recours to the second therefor it is necessari for a princ to understand how to avail himself of the beast and the man this has been figur taught to princ by ancient writer who describ how achill and mani other princ of old were given to the centaur chiron to nurs who brought them up in his disciplin which mean sole that as they had for a teacher one who was half beast and half man so it is necessari for a princ to know how to make use of both natur and that one without the other is not durabl a princ therefor be compel know to adopt the beast ought to choos the fox and the lion becaus the lion cannot defend himself against snare and the fox cannot defend himself against wolv therefor it is necessari to be a fox to discov the snare and a lion to terrifi the wolv those who reli simpli on the lion do not understand what they are about therefor a wise lord cannot nor ought he to keep faith when such observ may be turn against him and when the reason that caus him to pledg it exist no longer if men were entir good this precept would not hold but becaus they are bad and will not keep faith with you you too are not bound to observ it with them nor will there ever be want to a princ legitim reason to excus this non observ of this endless modern exampl could be given show how mani treati and engag have been made void and of no effect through the faithless of princ and he who has known best how to employ the fox has succeed best contest ie strive for masteri mr burd point out that this passag is imit direct from cicero de officii nam cum sint duo genera decertandi unum per disceptationem alterum per vim cumqu illud proprium sit homini hoc beluarum confugiendum est ad posterius si uti non licet superior but it is necessari to know well how to disguis this characterist and to be a great pretend and dissembl and men are so simpl and so subject to present necess that he who seek to deceiv will alway find someon who will allow himself to be deceiv one recent exampl i cannot pass over in silenc alexand the sixth did noth els but deceiv men nor ever thought of do otherwis and he alway found victim for there never was a man who had greater power in assert or who with greater oath would affirm a thing yet would observ it less nevertheless his deceit alway succeed accord to his wish becaus he well understood this side of mankind nondimanco sempr gli succederono gli inganni ad votum the word ad votum are omit in the testina addit 1550 alexand never did what he said cesar never said what he did italian proverb therefor it is unnecessari for a princ to have all the good qualiti i have enumer but it is veri necessari to appear to have them and i shall dare to say this also that to have them and alway to observ them is injuri and that to appear to have them is use to appear merci faith human religi upright and to be so but with a mind so frame that should you requir not to be so you may be abl and know how to chang to the opposit and you have to understand this that a princ especi a new one cannot observ all those thing for which men are esteem be often forc in order to maintain the state to act contrari to fidel friendship human and religion therefor it is necessari for him to have a mind readi to turn itself accord as the wind and variat of fortun forc it yet as i have said abov not to diverg from the good if he can avoid do so but if compel then to know how to set about it contrari to fidel or faith contro alla fede and tutto fede altogeth faith in the next paragraph it is noteworthi that these two phrase contro alla fede and tutto fede were omit in the testina edit which was publish with the sanction of the papal author it may be that the mean attach to the word fede was the faith ie the cathol creed and not as render here fidel and faith observ that the word religion was suffer to stand in the text of the testina be use to signifi indiffer everi shade of belief as wit the religion a phrase inevit employ to design the huguenot heresi south in his sermon ix p 69 ed 1843 comment on this passag as follow that great patron and coryphaeus of this tribe nicolo machiavel laid down this for a master rule in his polit scheme that the show of religion was help to the politician but the realiti of it hurt and pernici for this reason a princ ought to take care that he never let anyth slip from his lip that is not replet with the abov name five qualiti that he may appear to him who see and hear him altogeth merci faith human upright and religi there is noth more necessari to appear to have than this last qualiti inasmuch as men judg general more by the eye than by the hand becaus it belong to everybodi to see you to few to come in touch with you everi one see what you appear to be few realli know what you are and those few dare not oppos themselv to the opinion of the mani who have the majesti of the state to defend them and in the action of all men and especi of princ which it is not prudent to challeng one judg by the result for that reason let a princ have the credit of conquer and hold his state the mean will alway be consid honest and he will be prais by everybodi becaus the vulgar are alway taken by what a thing seem to be and by what come of it and in the world there are onli the vulgar for the few find a place there onli when the mani have no ground to rest on one princ of the present time whom it is not well to name never preach anyth els but peac and good faith and to both he is most hostil and either if he had kept it would have depriv him of reput and kingdom mani a time ferdinand of aragon when machiavelli was write the princ it would have been clear imposs to mention ferdinand name here without give offenc burd il princip p 308 chapter xix that one should avoid be despis and hate now concern the characterist of which mention is made abov i have spoken of the more import one the other i wish to discuss briefli under this general that the princ must consid as has been in part said befor how to avoid those thing which will make him hate or contempt and as often as he shall have succeed he will have fulfil his part and he need not fear ani danger in other reproach it make him hate abov all thing as i have said to be rapaci and to be a violat of the properti and women of his subject from both of which he must abstain and when neither their properti nor their honor is touch the major of men live content and he has onli to contend with the ambit of a few whom he can curb with eas in mani way it make him contempt to be consid fickl frivol effemin mean spirit irresolut from all of which a princ should guard himself as from a rock and he should endeavour to show in his action great courag graviti and fortitud and in his privat deal with his subject let him show that his judgment are irrevoc and maintain himself in such reput that no one can hope either to deceiv him or to get round him that princ is high esteem who convey this impress of himself and he who is high esteem is not easili conspir against for provid it is well known that he is an excel man and rever by his peopl he can onli be attack with difficulti for this reason a princ ought to have two fear one from within on account of his subject the other from without on account of extern power from the latter he is defend by be well arm and have good alli and if he is well arm he will have good friend and affair will alway remain quiet within when they are quiet without unless they should have been alreadi disturb by conspiraci and even should affair outsid be disturb if he has carri out his prepar and has live as i have said as long as he doe not despair he will resist everi attack as i said nabi the spartan did but concern his subject when affair outsid are disturb he has onli to fear that they will conspir secret from which a princ can easili secur himself by avoid be hate and despis and by keep the peopl satisfi with him which it is most necessari for him to accomplish as i said abov at length and one of the most efficaci remedi that a princ can have against conspiraci is not to be hate and despis by the peopl for he who conspir against a princ alway expect to pleas them by his remov but when the conspir can onli look forward to offend them he will not have the courag to take such a cours for the difficulti that confront a conspir are infinit and as experi show mani have been the conspiraci but few have been success becaus he who conspir cannot act alon nor can he take a companion except from those whom he believ to be malcont and as soon as you have open your mind to a malcont you have given him the materi with which to content himself for by denounc you he can look for everi advantag so that see the gain from this cours to be assur and see the other to be doubt and full of danger he must be a veri rare friend or a thorough obstin enemi of the princ to keep faith with you and to reduc the matter into a small compass i say that on the side of the conspir there is noth but fear jealousi prospect of punish to terrifi him but on the side of the princ there is the majesti of the princip the law the protect of friend and the state to defend him so that ad to all these thing the popular goodwil it is imposs that ani one should be so rash as to conspir for wherea in general the conspir has to fear befor the execut of his plot in this case he has also to fear the sequel to the crime becaus on account of it he has the peopl for an enemi and thus cannot hope for ani escap endless exampl could be given on this subject but i will be content with one brought to pass within the memori of our father messer annibal bentivog who was princ in bologna grandfath of the present annibal have been murder by the canneschi who had conspir against him not one of his famili surviv but messer giovanni who was in childhood immedi after his assassin the peopl rose and murder all the canneschi this sprung from the popular goodwil which the hous of bentivog enjoy in those day in bologna which was so great that although none remain there after the death of annibal who was abl to rule the state the bolognes have inform that there was one of the bentivog famili in florenc who up to that time had been consid the son of a blacksmith sent to florenc for him and gave him the govern of their citi and it was rule by him until messer giovanni came in due cours to the govern giovanni bentivog born in bologna 1438 die at milan 1508 he rule bologna from 1462 to 1506 machiavelli strong condemn of conspiraci may get it edg from his own veri recent experi februari 1513 when he had been arrest and tortur for his alleg complic in the boscoli conspiraci for this reason i consid that a princ ought to reckon conspiraci of littl account when his peopl hold him in esteem but when it is hostil to him and bear hatr toward him he ought to fear everyth and everybodi and well order state and wise princ have taken everi care not to drive the nobl to desper and to keep the peopl satisfi and content for this is one of the most import object a princ can have among the best order and govern kingdom of our time is franc and in it are found mani good institut on which depend the liberti and secur of the king of these the first is the parliament and it author becaus he who found the kingdom know the ambit of the nobil and their bold consid that a bit to their mouth would be necessari to hold them in and on the other side know the hatr of the peopl found in fear against the nobl he wish to protect them yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care of the king therefor to take away the reproach which he would be liabl to from the nobl for favour the peopl and from the peopl for favour the nobl he set up an arbit who should be one who could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the king neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrang or a greater sourc of secur to the king and kingdom from this one can draw anoth import conclus that princ ought to leav affair of reproach to the manag of other and keep those of grace in their own hand and further i consid that a princ ought to cherish the nobl but not so as to make himself hate by the peopl it may appear perhap to some who have examin the live and death of the roman emperor that mani of them would be an exampl contrari to my opinion see that some of them live nobli and show great qualiti of soul nevertheless they have lost their empir or have been kill by subject who have conspir against them wish therefor to answer these object i will recal the charact of some of the emperor and will show that the caus of their ruin were not differ to those alleg by me at the same time i will onli submit for consider those thing that are noteworthi to him who studi the affair of those time it seem to me suffici to take all those emperor who succeed to the empir from marcus the philosoph down to maximinus they were marcus and his son commodus pertinax julian severus and his son antoninus caracalla macrinus heliogabalus alexand and maximinus there is first to note that wherea in other princip the ambit of the nobl and the insol of the peopl onli have to be contend with the roman emperor had a third difficulti in have to put up with the cruelti and avaric of their soldier a matter so beset with difficulti that it was the ruin of mani for it was a hard thing to give satisfact both to soldier and peopl becaus the peopl love peac and for this reason they love the unaspir princ whilst the soldier love the warlik princ who was bold cruel and rapaci which qualiti they were quit will he should exercis upon the peopl so that they could get doubl pay and give vent to their own greed and cruelti henc it aros that those emperor were alway overthrown who either by birth or train had no great author and most of them especi those who came new to the princip recogn the difficulti of these two oppos humour were inclin to give satisfact to the soldier care littl about injur the peopl which cours was necessari becaus as princ cannot help be hate by someon they ought in the first place to avoid be hate by everi one and when they cannot compass this they ought to endeavour with the utmost dilig to avoid the hatr of the most power therefor those emperor who through inexperi had need of special favour adher more readili to the soldier than to the peopl a cours which turn out advantag to them or not accord as the princ knew how to maintain author over them from these caus it aros that marcus pertinax and alexand be all men of modest life lover of justic enemi to cruelti human and benign came to a sad end except marcus he alon live and die honour becaus he had succeed to the throne by hereditari titl and owe noth either to the soldier or the peopl and afterward be possess of mani virtu which made him respect he alway kept both order in their place whilst he live and was neither hate nor despis but pertinax was creat emperor against the wish of the soldier who be accustom to live licenti under commodus could not endur the honest life to which pertinax wish to reduc them thus have given caus for hatr to which hatr there was ad contempt for his old age he was overthrown at the veri begin of his administr and here it should be note that hatr is acquir as much by good work as by bad one therefor as i said befor a princ wish to keep his state is veri often forc to do evil for when that bodi is corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain yourselfit may be either the peopl or the soldier or the noblesyou have to submit to it humour and to gratifi them and then good work will do you harm but let us come to alexand who was a man of such great good that among the other prais which are accord him is this that in the fourteen year he held the empir no one was ever put to death by him unjudg nevertheless be consid effemin and a man who allow himself to be govern by his mother he becam despis the armi conspir against him and murder him turn now to the opposit charact of commodus severus antoninus caracalla and maximinus you will find them all cruel and rapaci men who to satisfi their soldier did not hesit to commit everi kind of iniqu against the peopl and all except severus came to a bad end but in severus there was so much valour that keep the soldier friend although the peopl were oppress by him he reign success for his valour made him so much admir in the sight of the soldier and peopl that the latter were kept in a way astonish and awe and the former respect and satisfi and becaus the action of this man as a new princ were great i wish to show briefli that he knew well how to counterfeit the fox and the lion which natur as i said abov it is necessari for a princ to imit know the sloth of the emperor julian he persuad the armi in sclavonia of which he was captain that it would be right to go to rome and aveng the death of pertinax who had been kill by the praetorian soldier and under this pretext without appear to aspir to the throne he move the armi on rome and reach itali befor it was known that he had start on his arriv at rome the senat through fear elect him emperor and kill julian after this there remain for severus who wish to make himself master of the whole empir two difficulti one in asia where niger head of the asiat armi had caus himself to be proclaim emperor the other in the west where albinus was who also aspir to the throne and as he consid it danger to declar himself hostil to both he decid to attack niger and to deceiv albinus to the latter he wrote that be elect emperor by the senat he was will to share that digniti with him and sent him the titl of caesar and moreov that the senat had made albinus his colleagu which thing were accept by albinus as true but after severus had conquer and kill niger and settl orient affair he return to rome and complain to the senat that albinus littl recogn the benefit that he had receiv from him had by treacheri sought to murder him and for this ingratitud he was compel to punish him afterward he sought him out in franc and took from him his govern and life he who will therefor care examin the action of this man will find him a most valiant lion and a most cun fox he will find him fear and respect by everi one and not hate by the armi and it need not be wonder at that he a new man was abl to hold the empir so well becaus his suprem renown alway protect him from that hatr which the peopl might have conceiv against him for his violenc but his son antoninus was a most emin man and had veri excel qualiti which made him admir in the sight of the peopl and accept to the soldier for he was a warlik man most endur of fatigu a despis of all delic food and other luxuri which caus him to be belov by the armi nevertheless his feroc and cruelti were so great and so unheard of that after endless singl murder he kill a larg number of the peopl of rome and all those of alexandria he becam hate by the whole world and also fear by those he had around him to such an extent that he was murder in the midst of his armi by a centurion and here it must be note that such like death which are deliber inflict with a resolv and desper courag cannot be avoid by princ becaus ani one who doe not fear to die can inflict them but a princ may fear them the less becaus they are veri rare he has onli to be care not to do ani grave injuri to those whom he employ or has around him in the servic of the state antoninus had not taken this care but had contumeli kill a brother of that centurion whom also he daili threaten yet retain in his bodyguard which as it turn out was a rash thing to do and prove the emperor ruin but let us come to commodus to whom it should have been veri easi to hold the empir for be the son of marcus he had inherit it and he had onli to follow in the footstep of his father to pleas his peopl and soldier but be by natur cruel and brutal he gave himself up to amus the soldier and corrupt them so that he might indulg his rapac upon the peopl on the other hand not maintain his digniti often descend to the theatr to compet with gladiat and do other vile thing littl worthi of the imperi majesti he fell into contempt with the soldier and be hate by one parti and despis by the other he was conspir against and was kill it remain to discuss the charact of maximinus he was a veri warlik man and the armi be disgust with the effeminaci of alexand of whom i have alreadi spoken kill him and elect maximinus to the throne this he did not possess for long for two thing made him hate and despis the one his have kept sheep in thrace which brought him into contempt it be well known to all and consid a great indign by everi one and the other his have at the access to his dominion defer go to rome and take possess of the imperi seat he had also gain a reput for the utmost feroc by have through his prefect in rome and elsewher in the empir practis mani cruelti so that the whole world was move to anger at the mean of his birth and to fear at his barbar first africa rebel then the senat with all the peopl of rome and all itali conspir against him to which may be ad his own armi this latter besieg aquileia and meet with difficulti in take it were disgust with his cruelti and fear him less when they found so mani against him murder him i do not wish to discuss heliogabalus macrinus or julian who be thorough contempt were quick wipe out but i will bring this discours to a conclus by say that princ in our time have this difficulti of give inordin satisfact to their soldier in a far less degre becaus notwithstand one has to give them some indulg that is soon done none of these princ have armi that are veteran in the govern and administr of provinc as were the armi of the roman empir and wherea it was then more necessari to give satisfact to the soldier than to the peopl it is now more necessari to all princ except the turk and the soldan to satisfi the peopl rather the soldier becaus the peopl are the more power from the abov i have except the turk who alway keep round him twelv thousand infantri and fifteen thousand cavalri on which depend the secur and strength of the kingdom and it is necessari that put asid everi consider for the peopl he should keep them his friend the kingdom of the soldan is similar be entir in the hand of soldier it follow again that without regard to the peopl he must keep them his friend but you must note that the state of the soldan is unlik all other princip for the reason that it is like the christian pontif which cannot be call either an hereditari or a newli form princip becaus the son of the old princ are not the heir but he who is elect to that posit by those who have author and the son remain onli noblemen and this be an ancient custom it cannot be call a new princip becaus there are none of those difficulti in it that are met with in new one for although the princ is new the constitut of the state is old and it is frame so as to receiv him as if he were it hereditari lord but return to the subject of our discours i say that whoever will consid it will acknowledg that either hatr or contempt has been fatal to the abov name emperor and it will be recogn also how it happen that a number of them act in one way and a number in anoth onli one in each way came to a happi end and the rest to unhappi one becaus it would have been useless and danger for pertinax and alexand be new princ to imit marcus who was heir to the princip and likewis it would have been utter destruct to caracalla commodus and maximinus to have imit severus they not have suffici valour to enabl them to tread in his footstep therefor a princ new to the princip cannot imit the action of marcus nor again is it necessari to follow those of severus but he ought to take from severus those part which are necessari to found his state and from marcus those which are proper and glorious to keep a state that may alreadi be stabl and firm chapter xx are fortress and mani other thing to which princ often resort advantag or hurt 1 some princ so as to hold secur the state have disarm their subject other have kept their subject town distract by faction other have foster enmiti against themselv other have laid themselv out to gain over those whom they distrust in the begin of their govern some have built fortress some have overthrown and destroy them and although one cannot give a final judgment on all of these thing unless one possess the particular of those state in which a decis has to be made nevertheless i will speak as comprehens as the matter of itself will admit 2 there never was a new princ who has disarm his subject rather when he has found them disarm he has alway arm them becaus by arm them those arm becom your those men who were distrust becom faith and those who were faith are kept so and your subject becom your adher and wherea all subject cannot be arm yet when those whom you do arm are benefit the other can be handl more freeli and this differ in their treatment which they quit understand make the former your depend and the latter consid it to be necessari that those who have the most danger and servic should have the most reward excus you but when you disarm them you at onc offend them by show that you distrust them either for cowardic or for want of loyalti and either of these opinion breed hatr against you and becaus you cannot remain unarm it follow that you turn to mercenari which are of the charact alreadi shown even if they should be good they would not be suffici to defend you against power enemi and distrust subject therefor as i have said a new princ in a new princip has alway distribut arm histori are full of exampl but when a princ acquir a new state which he add as a provinc to his old one then it is necessari to disarm the men of that state except those who have been his adher in acquir it and these again with time and opportun should be render soft and effemin and matter should be manag in such a way that all the arm men in the state shall be your own soldier who in your old state were live near you 3 our forefath and those who were reckon wise were accustom to say that it was necessari to hold pistoia by faction and pisa by fortress and with this idea they foster quarrel in some of their tributari town so as to keep possess of them the more easili this may have been well enough in those time when itali was in a way balanc but i do not believ that it can be accept as a precept for to day becaus i do not believ that faction can ever be of use rather it is certain that when the enemi come upon you in divid citi you are quick lost becaus the weakest parti will alway assist the outsid forc and the other will not be abl to resist the venetian move as i believ by the abov reason foster the guelph and ghibellin faction in their tributari citi and although they never allow them to come to bloodsh yet they nurs these disput amongst them so that the citizen distract by their differ should not unit against them which as we saw did not afterward turn out as expect becaus after the rout at vaila one parti at onc took courag and seiz the state such method argu therefor weak in the princ becaus these faction will never be permit in a vigor princip such method for enabl one the more easili to manag subject are onli use in time of peac but if war come this polici prove fallaci 4 without doubt princ becom great when they overcom the difficulti and obstacl by which they are confront and therefor fortun especi when she desir to make a new princ great who has a greater necess to earn renown than an hereditari one caus enemi to aris and form design against him in order that he may have the opportun of overcom them and by them to mount higher as by a ladder which his enemi have rais for this reason mani consid that a wise princ when he has the opportun ought with craft to foster some animos against himself so that have crush it his renown may rise higher 5 princ especi new one have found more fidel and assist in those men who in the begin of their rule were distrust than among those who in the begin were trust pandolfo petrucci princ of siena rule his state more by those who had been distrust than by other but on this question one cannot speak general for it vari so much with the individu i will onli say this that those men who at the commenc of a princedom have been hostil if they are of a descript to need assist to support themselv can alway be gain over with the greatest eas and they will be tight held to serv the princ with fidel inasmuch as they know it to be veri necessari for them to cancel by deed the bad impress which he had form of them and thus the princ alway extract more profit from them than from those who serv him in too much secur may neglect his affair and sinc the matter demand it i must not fail to warn a princ who by mean of secret favour has acquir a new state that he must well consid the reason which induc those to favour him who did so and if it be not a natur affect toward him but onli discont with their govern then he will onli keep them friend with great troubl and difficulti for it will be imposs to satisfi them and weigh well the reason for this in those exampl which can be taken from ancient and modern affair we shall find that it is easier for the princ to make friend of those men who were content under the former govern and are therefor his enemi than of those who be discont with it were favour to him and encourag him to seiz it 6 it has been a custom with princ in order to hold their state more secur to build fortress that may serv as a bridl and bit to those who might design to work against them and as a place of refug from a first attack i prais this system becaus it has been made use of former notwithstand that messer nicolo vitelli in our time has been seen to demolish two fortress in citta di castello so that he might keep that state guido ubaldo duke of urbino on return to his dominion whenc he had been driven by cesar borgia raze to the foundat all the fortress in that provinc and consid that without them it would be more difficult to lose it the bentivog return to bologna came to a similar decis fortress therefor are use or not accord to circumst if they do you good in one way they injur you in anoth and this question can be reason thus the princ who has more to fear from the peopl than from foreign ought to build fortress but he who has more to fear from foreign than from the peopl ought to leav them alon the castl of milan built by francesco sforza has made and will make more troubl for the hous of sforza than ani other disord in the state for this reason the best possibl fortress isnot to be hate by the peopl becaus although you may hold the fortress yet they will not save you if the peopl hate you for there will never be want foreign to assist a peopl who have taken arm against you it has not been seen in our time that such fortress have been of use to ani princ unless to the countess of for when the count girolamo her consort was kill for by that mean she was abl to withstand the popular attack and wait for assist from milan and thus recov her state and the postur of affair was such at that time that the foreign could not assist the peopl but fortress were of littl valu to her afterward when cesar borgia attack her and when the peopl her enemi were alli with foreign therefor it would have been safer for her both then and befor not to have been hate by the peopl than to have had the fortress all these thing consid then i shall prais him who build fortress as well as him who doe not and i shall blame whoever trust in them care littl about be hate by the peopl catherin sforza a daughter of galeazzo sforza and lucrezia landriani born 1463 die 1509 it was to the countess of for that machiavelli was sent as envi on 1499 a letter from fortunati to the countess announc the appoint i have been with the signori wrote fortunati to learn whom they would send and when they tell me that nicolo machiavelli a learn young florentin nobl secretari to my lord of the ten is to leav with me at onc cf catherin sforza by count pasolini translat by p sylvest 1898 chapter xxi how a princ should conduct himself so as to gain renown noth make a princ so much esteem as great enterpris and set a fine exampl we have in our time ferdinand of aragon the present king of spain he can almost be call a new princ becaus he has risen by fame and glori from be an insignific king to be the foremost king in christendom and if you will consid his deed you will find them all great and some of them extraordinari in the begin of his reign he attack granada and this enterpris was the foundat of his dominion he did this quiet at first and without ani fear of hindranc for he held the mind of the baron of castil occupi in think of the war and not anticip ani innov thus they did not perceiv that by these mean he was acquir power and author over them he was abl with the money of the church and of the peopl to sustain his armi and by that long war to lay the foundat for the militari skill which has sinc distinguish him further alway use religion as a plea so as to undertak greater scheme he devot himself with pious cruelti to drive out and clear his kingdom of the moor nor could there be a more admir exampl nor one more rare under this same cloak he assail africa he came down on itali he has final attack franc and thus his achiev and design have alway been great and have kept the mind of his peopl in suspens and admir and occupi with the issu of them and his action have arisen in such a way one out of the other that men have never been given time to work steadili against him again it much assist a princ to set unusu exampl in intern affair similar to those which are relat of messer bernabo da milano who when he had the opportun by ani one in civil life do some extraordinari thing either good or bad would take some method of reward or punish him which would be much spoken about and a princ ought abov all thing alway endeavour in everi action to gain for himself the reput of be a great and remark man a princ is also respect when he is either a true friend or a downright enemi that is to say when without ani reserv he declar himself in favour of one parti against the other which cours will alway be more advantag than stand neutral becaus if two of your power neighbour come to blow they are of such a charact that if one of them conquer you have either to fear him or not in either case it will alway be more advantag for you to declar yourself and to make war strenuous becaus in the first case if you do not declar yourself you will invari fall a prey to the conqueror to the pleasur and satisfact of him who has been conquer and you will have no reason to offer nor anyth to protect or to shelter you becaus he who conquer doe not want doubt friend who will not aid him in the time of trial and he who lose will not harbour you becaus you did not will sword in hand court his fate antiochus went into greec be sent for by the aetolian to drive out the roman he sent envoy to the achaean who were friend of the roman exhort them to remain neutral and on the other hand the roman urg them to take up arm this question came to be discuss in the council of the achaean where the legat of antiochus urg them to stand neutral to this the roman legat answer as for that which has been said that it is better and more advantag for your state not to interfer in our war noth can be more erron becaus by not interf you will be left without favour or consider the guerdon of the conqueror thus it will alway happen that he who is not your friend will demand your neutral whilst he who is your friend will entreat you to declar yourself with arm and irresolut princ to avoid present danger general follow the neutral path and are general ruin but when a princ declar himself gallant in favour of one side if the parti with whom he alli himself conquer although the victor may be power and may have him at his merci yet he is indebt to him and there is establish a bond of amiti and men are never so shameless as to becom a monument of ingratitud by oppress you victori after all are never so complet that the victor must not show some regard especi to justic but if he with whom you alli yourself lose you may be shelter by him and whilst he is abl he may aid you and you becom companion on a fortun that may rise again in the second case when those who fight are of such a charact that you have no anxieti as to who may conquer so much the more is it greater prudenc to be alli becaus you assist at the destruct of one by the aid of anoth who if he had been wise would have save him and conquer as it is imposs that he should not do with your assist he remain at your discret and here it is to be note that a princ ought to take care never to make an allianc with one more power than himself for the purpos of attack other unless necess compel him as is said abov becaus if he conquer you are at his discret and princ ought to avoid as much as possibl be at the discret of ani one the venetian join with franc against the duke of milan and this allianc which caus their ruin could have been avoid but when it cannot be avoid as happen to the florentin when the pope and spain sent armi to attack lombardi then in such a case for the abov reason the princ ought to favour one of the parti never let ani govern imagin that it can choos perfect safe cours rather let it expect to have to take veri doubt one becaus it is found in ordinari affair that one never seek to avoid one troubl without run into anoth but prudenc consist in know how to distinguish the charact of troubl and for choic to take the lesser evil a princ ought also to show himself a patron of abil and to honour the profici in everi art at the same time he should encourag his citizen to practis their call peaceabl both in commerc and agricultur and in everi other follow so that the one should not be deter from improv his possess for fear lest they be taken away from him or anoth from open up trade for fear of tax but the princ ought to offer reward to whoever wish to do these thing and design in ani way to honour his citi or state further he ought to entertain the peopl with festiv and spectacl at conveni season of the year and as everi citi is divid into guild or into societi he ought to hold such bodi in esteem and associ with them sometim and show himself an exampl of courtesi and liber nevertheless alway maintain the majesti of his rank for this he must never consent to abat in anyth guild or societi in arti o in tribu arti were craft or trade guild cf florio art a whole compani of ani trade in ani citi or corpor town the guild of florenc are most admir describ by mr

perhap our word sect or clan would be most appropri chapter xxii concern the secretari of princ the choic of servant is of no littl import to a princ and they are good or not accord to the discrimin of the princ and the first opinion which one form of a princ and of his understand is by observ the men he has around him and when they are capabl and faith he may alway be consid wise becaus he has known how to recogn the capabl and to keep them faith but when they are otherwis one cannot form a good opinion of him for the prime error which he made was in choos them there were none who knew messer antonio da venafro as the servant of pandolfo petrucci princ of siena who would not consid pandolfo to be a veri clever man in have venafro for his servant becaus there are three class of intellect one which comprehend by itself anoth which appreci what other comprehend and a third which neither comprehend by itself nor by the show of other the first is the most excel the second is good the third is useless therefor it follow necessarili that if pandolfo was not in the first rank he was in the second for whenev one has judgment to know good and bad when it is said and done although he himself may not have the initi yet he can recogn the good and the bad in his servant and the one he can prais and the other correct thus the servant cannot hope to deceiv him and is kept honest but to enabl a princ to form an opinion of his servant there is one test which never fail when you see the servant think more of his own interest than of your and seek inward his own profit in everyth such a man will never make a good servant nor will you ever be abl to trust him becaus he who has the state of anoth in his hand ought never to think of himself but alway of his princ and never pay ani attent to matter in which the princ is not concern on the other hand to keep his servant honest the princ ought to studi him honour him enrich him do him kind share with him the honour and care and at the same time let him see that he cannot stand alon so that mani honour may not make him desir more mani rich make him wish for more and that mani care may make him dread chanc when therefor servant and princ toward servant are thus dispos they can trust each other but when it is otherwis the end will alway be disastr for either one or the other chapter xxiii how flatter should be avoid i do not wish to leav out an import branch of this subject for it is a danger from which princ are with difficulti preserv unless they are veri care and discrimin it is that of flatter of whom court are full becaus men are so self complac in their own affair and in a way so deceiv in them that they are preserv with difficulti from this pest and if they wish to defend themselv they run the danger of fall into contempt becaus there is no other way of guard oneself from flatter except let men understand that to tell you the truth doe not offend you but when everi one may tell you the truth respect for you abat therefor a wise princ ought to hold a third cours by choos the wise men in his state and give to them onli the liberti of speak the truth to him and then onli of those thing of which he inquir and of none other but he ought to question them upon everyth and listen to their opinion and afterward form his own conclus with these councillor separ and collect he ought to carri himself in such a way that each of them should know that the more freeli he shall speak the more he shall be prefer outsid of these he should listen to no one pursu the thing resolv on and be steadfast in his resolut he who doe otherwis is either overthrown by flatter or is so often chang by vari opinion that he fall into contempt i wish on this subject to adduc a modern exampl fra luca the man of affair to maximilian the present emperor speak of his majesti said he consult with no one yet never got his own way in anyth this aros becaus of his follow a practic the opposit to the abov for the emperor is a secret manh doe not communic his design to ani one nor doe he receiv opinion on them but as in carri them into effect they becom reveal and known they are at onc obstruct by those men whom he has around him and he be pliant is divert from them henc it follow that those thing he doe one day he undo the next and no one ever understand what he wish or intend to do and no one can reli on his resolut maximilian i born in 1459 die 1519 emperor of the holi roman empir he marri first mari daughter of charl the bold after her death bianca sforza and thus becam involv in italian polit a princ therefor ought alway to take counsel but onli when he wish and not when other wish he ought rather to discourag everi one from offer advic unless he ask it but howev he ought to be a constant inquir and afterward a patient listen concern the thing of which he inquir also on learn that ani one on ani consider has not told him the truth he should let his anger be felt and if there are some who think that a princ who convey an impress of his wisdom is not so through his own abil but through the good advis that he has around him beyond doubt they are deceiv becaus this is an axiom which never fail that a princ who is not wise himself will never take good advic unless by chanc he has yield his affair entir to one person who happen to be a veri prudent man in this case inde he may be well govern but it would not be for long becaus such a governor would in a short time take away his state from him but if a princ who is not inexperienc should take counsel from more than one he will never get unit counsel nor will he know how to unit them each of the counsellor will think of his own interest and the princ will not know how to control them or to see through them and they are not to found otherwis becaus men will alway prove untru to you unless they are kept honest by constraint therefor it must be infer that good counsel whencesoev they come are born of the wisdom of the princ and not the wisdom of the princ from good counsel chapter xxiv whi the princ of itali have lost their state the previous suggest care observ will enabl a new princ to appear well establish and render him at onc more secur and fix in the state than if he had been long seat there for the action of a new princ are more narrowli observ than those of an hereditari one and when they are seen to be abl they gain more men and bind far tighter than ancient blood becaus men are attract more by the present than by the past and when they find the present good they enjoy it and seek no further they will also make the utmost defenc of a princ if he fail them not in other thing thus it will be a doubl glori for him to have establish a new princip and adorn and strengthen it with good law good arm good alli and with a good exampl so will it be a doubl disgrac to him who born a princ shall lose his state by want of wisdom and if those seignior are consid who have lost their state in itali in our time such as the king of napl the duke of milan and other there will be found in them first one common defect in regard to arm from the caus which have been discuss at length in the next place some one of them will be seen either to have had the peopl hostil or if he has had the peopl friend he has not known how to secur the nobl in the absenc of these defect state that have power enough to keep an armi in the field cannot be lost philip of macedon not the father of alexand the great but he who was conquer by titus quintius had not much territori compar to the great of the roman and of greec who attack him yet be a warlik man who knew how to attract the peopl and secur the nobl he sustain the war against his enemi for mani year and if in the end he lost the dominion of some citi nevertheless he retain the kingdom therefor do not let our princ accus fortun for the loss of their princip after so mani year possess but rather their own sloth becaus in quiet time they never thought there could be a chang it is a common defect in man not to make ani provis in the calm against the tempest and when afterward the bad time came they thought of flight and not of defend themselv and they hope that the peopl disgust with the insol of the conqueror would recal them this cours when other fail may be good but it is veri bad to have neglect all other expedi for that sinc you would never wish to fall becaus you trust to be abl to find someon later on to restor you this again either doe not happen or if it doe it will not be for your secur becaus that deliver is of no avail which doe not depend upon yourself those onli are reliabl certain and durabl that depend on yourself and your valour chapter xxv what fortun can effect in human affair and how to withstand her it is not unknown to me how mani men have had and still have the opinion that the affair of the world are in such wise govern by fortun and by god that men with their wisdom cannot direct them and that no one can even help them and becaus of this they would have us believ that it is not necessari to labour much in affair but to let chanc govern them this opinion has been more credit in our time becaus of the great chang in affair which have been seen and may still be seen everi day beyond all human conjectur sometim ponder over this i am in some degre inclin to their opinion nevertheless not to extinguish our free will i hold it to be true that fortun is the arbit of one half of our action but that she still leav us to direct the other half or perhap a littl less frederick the great was accustom to say the older one get the more convinc one becom that his majesti king chanc doe three quarter of the busi of this miser univers sorel eastern question i compar her to one of those rage river which when in flood overflow the plain sweep away tree and build bear away the soil from place to place everyth fli befor it all yield to it violenc without be abl in ani way to withstand it and yet though it natur be such it doe not follow therefor that men when the weather becom fair shall not make provis both with defenc and barrier in such a manner that rise again the water may pass away by canal and their forc be neither so unrestrain nor so danger so it happen with fortun who show her power where valour has not prepar to resist her and thither she turn her forc where she know that barrier and defenc have not been rais to constrain her and if you will consid itali which is the seat of these chang and which has given to them their impuls you will see it to be an open countri without barrier and without ani defenc for if it had been defend by proper valour as are germani spain and franc either this invas would not have made the great chang it has made or it would not have come at all and this i consid enough to say concern resist to fortun in general but confin myself more to the particular i say that a princ may be seen happi to day and ruin to morrow without have shown ani chang of disposit or charact this i believ aris first from caus that have alreadi been discuss at length name that the princ who reli entir on fortun is lost when it chang i believ also that he will be success who direct his action accord to the spirit of the time and that he whose action do not accord with the time will not be success becaus men are seen in affair that lead to the end which everi man has befor him name glori and rich to get there by various method one with caution anoth with hast one by forc anoth by skill one by patienc anoth by it opposit and each one succeed in reach the goal by a differ method one can also see of two cautious men the one attain his end the other fail and similar two men by differ observ are equal success the one be cautious the other impetu all this aris from noth els than whether or not they conform in their method to the spirit of the time this follow from what i have said that two men work differ bring about the same effect and of two work similar one attain his object and the other doe not chang in estat also issu from this for if to one who govern himself with caution and patienc time and affair converg in such a way that his administr is success his fortun is made but if time and affair chang he is ruin if he doe not chang his cours of action but a man is not often found suffici circumspect to know how to accommod himself to the chang both becaus he cannot deviat from what natur inclin him to do and also becaus have alway prosper by act in one way he cannot be persuad that it is well to leav it and therefor the cautious man when it is time to turn adventur doe not know how to do it henc he is ruin but had he chang his conduct with the time fortun would not have chang pope julius the second went to work impetu in all his affair and found the time and circumst conform so well to that line of action that he alway met with success consid his first enterpris against bologna messer giovanni bentivog be still aliv the venetian were not agreeabl to it nor was the king of spain and he had the enterpris still under discuss with the king of franc nevertheless he person enter upon the expedit with his accustom bold and energi a move which made spain and the venetian stand irresolut and passiv the latter from fear the former from desir to recov the kingdom of napl on the other hand he drew after him the king of franc becaus that king have observ the movement and desir to make the pope his friend so as to humbl the venetian found it imposs to refus him therefor julius with his impetu action accomplish what no other pontiff with simpl human wisdom could have done for if he had wait in rome until he could get away with his plan arrang and everyth fix as ani other pontiff would have done he would never have succeed becaus the king of franc would have made a thousand excus and the other would have rais a thousand fear i will leav his other action alon as they were all alik and they all succeed for the short of his life did not let him experi the contrari but if circumst had arisen which requir him to go cautious his ruin would have follow becaus he would never have deviat from those way to which natur inclin him i conclud therefor that fortun be chang and mankind steadfast in their way so long as the two are in agreement men are success but unsuccess when they fall out for my part i consid that it is better to be adventur than cautious becaus fortun is a woman and if you wish to keep her under it is necessari to beat and ill use her and it is seen that she allow herself to be master by the adventur rather than by those who go to work more cold she is therefor alway woman like a lover of young men becaus they are less cautious more violent and with more audac command her chapter xxvi an exhort to liber itali from the barbarian have care consid the subject of the abov discours and wonder within myself whether the present time were propiti to a new princ and whether there were element that would give an opportun to a wise and virtuous one to introduc a new order of thing which would do honour to him and good to the peopl of this countri it appear to me that so mani thing concur to favour a new princ that i never knew a time more fit than the present and if as i said it was necessari that the peopl of israel should be captiv so as to make manifest the abil of mose that the persian should be oppress by the mede so as to discov the great of the soul of cyrus and that the athenian should be dispers to illustr the capabl of theseus then at the present time in order to discov the virtu of an italian spirit it was necessari that itali should be reduc to the extrem that she is now in that she should be more enslav than the hebrew more oppress than the persian more scatter than the athenian without head without order beaten despoil torn overrun and to have endur everi kind of desol although late some spark may have been shown by one which made us think he was ordain by god for our redempt nevertheless it was afterward seen in the height of his career that fortun reject him so that itali left as without life wait for him who shall yet heal her wound and put an end to the ravag and plunder of lombardi to the swindl and tax of the kingdom and of tuscani and cleans those sore that for long have fester it is seen how she entreat god to send someon who shall deliv her from these wrong and barbar insol it is seen also that she is readi and will to follow a banner if onli someon will rais it nor is there to be seen at present one in whom she can place more hope than in your illustri hous with it valour and fortun favour by god and by the church of which it is now the chief and which could be made the head of this redempt this will not be difficult if you will recal to yourself the action and live of the men i have name and although they were great and wonder men yet they were men and each one of them had no more opportun than the present offer for their enterpris were neither more just nor easier than this nor was god more their friend than he is your giuliano de medici he had just been creat a cardin by leo x in 1523 giuliano was elect pope and took the titl of clement vii with us there is great justic becaus that war is just which is necessari and arm are hallow when there is no other hope but in them here there is the greatest willing and where the willing is great the difficulti cannot be great if you will onli follow those men to whom i have direct your attent further than this how extraordinarili the way of god have been manifest beyond exampl the sea is divid a cloud has led the way the rock has pour forth water it has rain manna everyth has contribut to your great you ought to do the rest god is not will to do everyth and thus take away our free will and that share of glori which belong to us and it is not to be wonder at if none of the abov name italian have been abl to accomplish all that is expect from your illustri hous and if in so mani revolut in itali and in so mani campaign it has alway appear as if militari virtu were exhaust this has happen becaus the old order of thing was not good and none of us have known how to find a new one and noth honour a man more than to establish new law and new ordin when he himself was newli risen such thing when they are well found and dignifi will make him rever and admir and in itali there are not want opportun to bring such into use in everi form here there is great valour in the limb whilst it fail in the head look attent at the duel and the hand to hand combat how superior the italian are in strength dexter and subtleti but when it come to armi they do not bear comparison and this spring entir from the insuffici of the leader sinc those who are capabl are not obedi and each one seem to himself to know there have never been ani one so distinguish abov the rest either by valour or fortun that other would yield to him henc it is that for so long a time and dure so much fight in the past twenti year whenev there has been an armi wholli italian it has alway given a poor account of itself the first wit to this is il taro afterward allesandria capua genoa vaila bologna mestri the battl of il taro 1495 alessandria 1499 capua 1501 genoa 1507 vaila 1509 bologna 1511 mestri 1513 if therefor your illustri hous wish to follow these remark men who have redeem their countri it is necessari befor all thing as a true foundat for everi enterpris to be provid with your own forc becaus there can be no more faith truer or better soldier and although singl they are good altogeth they will be much better when they find themselv command by their princ honour by him and maintain at his expens therefor it is necessari to be prepar with such arm so that you can be defend against foreign by italian valour and although swiss and spanish infantri may be consid veri formid nevertheless there is a defect in both by reason of which a third order would not onli be abl to oppos them but might be reli upon to overthrow them for the spaniard cannot resist cavalri and the switzer are afraid of infantri whenev they encount them in close combat owe to this as has been and may again be seen the spaniard are unabl to resist french cavalri and the switzer are overthrown by spanish infantri and although a complet proof of this latter cannot be shown nevertheless there was some evid of it at the battl of ravenna when the spanish infantri were confront by german battalion who follow the same tactic as the swiss when the spaniard by agil of bodi and with the aid of their shield got in under the pike of the german and stood out of danger abl to attack while the german stood helpless and if the cavalri had not dash up all would have been over with them it is possibl therefor know the defect of both these infantri to invent a new one which will resist cavalri and not be afraid of infantri this need not creat a new order of arm but a variat upon the old and these are the kind of improv which confer reput and power upon a new princ this opportun therefor ought not to be allow to pass for let itali at last see her liber appear nor can one express the love with which he would be receiv in all those provinc which have suffer so much from these foreign scour with what thirst for reveng with what stubborn faith with what devot with what tear what door would be close to him who would refus obedi to him what envi would hinder him what italian would refus him homag to all of us this barbar dominion stink let therefor your illustri hous take up this charg with that courag and hope with which all just enterpris are undertaken so that under it standard our nativ countri may be ennobl and under it auspic may be verifi that say of petrarch virtu contro al furor prendera larm e fia il combatt corto che lantico valor neg italici cuor non e ancor morto virtu against furi shall advanc the fight and it i th combat soon shall put to flight for the old roman valour is not dead nor in th italian brest extinguish edward dacr 1640 descript of the method adopt by the duke valentino when murder vitellozzo vitelli oliverotto da fermo the signor pagolo and the duke di gravina orsini by nicolo machiavelli the duke valentino had return from lombardi where he had been to clear himself with the king of franc from the calumni which had been rais against him by the florentin concern the rebellion of arezzo and other town in the val di chiana and had arriv at imola whenc he intend with his armi to enter upon the campaign against giovanni bentivog the tyrant of bologna for he intend to bring that citi under his domin and to make it the head of his romagnian duchi these matter come to the knowledg of the vitelli and orsini and their follow it appear to them that the duke would becom too power and it was fear that have seiz bologna he would seek to destroy them in order that he might becom suprem in itali upon this a meet was call at magion in the district of perugia to which came the cardin pagolo and the duke di gravina orsini vitellozzo vitelli oliverotto da fermo gianpagolo baglioni the tyrant of perugia and messer antonio da venafro sent by pandolfo petrucci the princ of siena here were discuss the power and courag of the duke and the necess of curb his ambit which might otherwis bring danger to the rest of be ruin and they decid not to abandon the bentivog but to strive to win over the florentin and they send their men to one place and anoth promis to one parti assist and to anoth encourag to unit with them against the common enemi this meet was at onc report throughout all itali and those who were discont under the duke among whom were the peopl of urbino took hope of effect a revolut thus it aros that men mind be thus unsettl it was decid by certain men of urbino to seiz the fortress of san leo which was held for the duke and which they captur by the follow mean the castellan was fortifi the rock and caus timber to be taken there so the conspir watch and when certain beam which were be carri to the rock were upon the bridg so that it was prevent from be drawn up by those insid they took the opportun of leap upon the bridg and thenc into the fortress upon this captur be effect the whole state rebel and recal the old duke be encourag in this not so much by the captur of the fort as by the diet at magion from whom they expect to get assist those who heard of the rebellion at urbino thought they would not lose the opportun and at onc assembl their men so as to take ani town should ani remain in the hand of the duke in that state and they sent again to florenc to beg that republ to join with them in destroy the common firebrand show that the risk was lessen and that they ought not to wait for anoth opportun but the florentin from hatr for sundri reason of the vitelli and orsini not onli would not alli themselv but sent nicolo machiavelli their secretari to offer shelter and assist to the duke against his enemi the duke was found full of fear at imola becaus against everybodi expect his soldier had at onc gone over to the enemi and he found himself disarm and war at his door but recov courag from the offer of the florentin he decid to tempor befor fight with the few soldier that remain to him and to negoti for a reconcili and also to get assist this latter he obtain in two way by send to the king of franc for men and by enlist men at arm and other whom he turn into cavalri of a sort to all he gave money notwithstand this his enemi drew near to him and approach fossombron where they encount some men of the duke and with the aid of the orsini and vitelli rout them when this happen the duke resolv at onc to see if he could not close the troubl with offer of reconcili and be a most perfect dissembl he did not fail in ani practic to make the insurg understand that he wish everi man who had acquir anyth to keep it as it was enough for him to have the titl of princ whilst other might have the princip and the duke succeed so well in this that they sent signor pagolo to him to negoti for a reconcili and they brought their armi to a standstil but the duke did not stop his prepar and took everi care to provid himself with cavalri and infantri and that such prepar might not be appar to the other he sent his troop in separ parti to everi part of the romagna in the meanwhil there came also to him five hundr french lancer and although he found himself suffici strong to take vengeanc on his enemi in open war he consid that it would be safer and more advantag to outwit them and for this reason he did not stop the work of reconcili and that this might be effect the duke conclud a peac with them in which he confirm their former coven he gave them four thousand ducat at onc he promis not to injur the bentivog and he form an allianc with giovanni and moreov he would not forc them to come person into his presenc unless it pleas them to do so on the other hand they promis to restor to him the duchi of urbino and other place seiz by them to serv him in all his expedit and not to make war against or alli themselv with ani one without his permiss this reconcili be complet guido ubaldo the duke of urbino again fled to venic have first destroy all the fortress in his state becaus trust in the peopl he did not wish that the fortress which he did not think he could defend should be held by the enemi sinc by these mean a check would be kept upon his friend but the duke valentino have complet this convent and dispers his men throughout the romagna set out for imola at the end of novemb togeth with his french men at arm thenc he went to cesena where he stay some time to negoti with the envoy of the vitelli and orsini who had assembl with their men in the duchi of urbino as to the enterpris in which they should now take part but noth be conclud oliverotto da fermo was sent to propos that if the duke wish to undertak an expedit against tuscani they were readi if he did not wish it then they would besieg sinigalia to this the duke repli that he did not wish to enter into war with tuscani and thus becom hostil to the florentin but that he was veri will to proceed against sinigalia it happen that not long afterward the town surrend but the fortress would not yield to them becaus the castellan would not give it up to ani one but the duke in person therefor they exhort him to come there this appear a good opportun to the duke as be invit by them and not go of his own will he would awaken no suspicion and the more to reassur them he allow all the french men at arm who were with him in lombardi to depart except the hundr lancer under mon di candal his brother in law he left cesena about the middl of decemb and went to fano and with the utmost cun and clever he persuad the vitelli and orsini to wait for him at sinigalia point out to them that ani lack of complianc would cast a doubt upon the sincer and perman of the reconcili and that he was a man who wish to make use of the arm and council of his friend but vitellozzo remain veri stubborn for the death of his brother warn him that he should not offend a princ and afterward trust him nevertheless persuad by pagolo orsini whom the duke had corrupt with gift and promis he agre to wait upon this the duke befor his departur from fano which was to be on 30th decemb 1502 communic his design to eight of his most trust follow among whom were don michel and the monsignor deuna who was afterward cardin and he order that as soon as vitellozzo pagolo orsini the duke di gravina and oliverotto should arriv his follow in pair should take them one by one entrust certain men to certain pair who should entertain them until they reach sinigalia nor should they be permit to leav until they came to the duke quarter where they should be seiz the duke afterward order all his horsemen and infantri of which there were more than two thousand cavalri and ten thousand footmen to assembl by daybreak at the metauro a river five mile distant from fano and await him there he found himself therefor on the last day of decemb at the metauro with his men and have sent a cavalcad of about two hundr horsemen befor him he then move forward the infantri whom he accompani with the rest of the men at arm fano and sinigalia are two citi of la marca situat on the shore of the adriat sea fifteen mile distant from each other so that he who goe toward sinigalia has the mountain on his right hand the base of which are touch by the sea in some place the citi of sinigalia is distant from the foot of the mountain a littl more than a bow shot and from the shore about a mile on the side opposit to the citi run a littl river which bath that part of the wall look toward fano face the high road thus he who draw near to sinigalia come for a good space by road along the mountain and reach the river which pass by sinigalia if he turn to his left hand along the bank of it and goe for the distanc of a bow shot he arriv at a bridg which cross the river he is then almost abreast of the gate that lead into sinigalia not by a straight line but transvers befor this gate there stand a collect of hous with a squar to which the bank of the river form one side the vitelli and orsini have receiv order to wait for the duke and to honour him in person sent away their men to sever castl distant from sinigalia about six mile so that room could be made for the men of the duke and they left in sinigalia onli oliverotto and his band which consist of one thousand infantri and one hundr and fifti horsemen who were quarter in the suburb mention abov matter have been thus arrang the duke valentino left for sinigalia and when the leader of the cavalri reach the bridg they did not pass over but have open it one portion wheel toward the river and the other toward the countri and a way was left in the middl through which the infantri pass without stop into the town vitellozzo pagolo and the duke di gravina on mule accompani by a few horsemen went toward the duke vitellozo unarm and wear a cape line with green appear veri deject as if conscious of his approach deatha circumst which in view of the abil of the man and his former fortun caus some amaz and it is said that when he part from his men befor set out for sinigalia to meet the duke he act as if it were his last part from them he recommend his hous and it fortun to his captain and advis his nephew that it was not the fortun of their hous but the virtu of their father that should be kept in mind these three therefor came befor the duke and salut him respect and were receiv by him with goodwil they were at onc place between those who were commiss to look after them but the duke notic that oliverotto who had remain with his band in sinigalia was missingfor oliverotto was wait in the squar befor his quarter near the river keep his men in order and drill themsignal with his eye to don michell to whom the care of oliverotto had been commit that he should take measur that oliverotto should not escap therefor don michel rode off and join oliverotto tell him that it was not right to keep his men out of their quarter becaus these might be taken up by the men of the duke and he advis him to send them at onc to their quarter and to come himself to meet the duke and oliverotto have taken this advic came befor the duke who when he saw him call to him and oliverotto have made his obeis join the other so the whole parti enter sinigalia dismount at the duke quarter and went with him into a secret chamber where the duke made them prison he then mount on horseback and issu order that the men of oliverotto and the orsini should be strip of their arm those of oliverotto be at hand were quick settl but those of the orsini and vitelli be at a distanc and have a presenti of the destruct of their master had time to prepar themselv and bear in mind the valour and disciplin of the orsinian and vitellian hous they stood togeth against the hostil forc of the countri and save themselv but the duke soldier not be content with have pillag the men of oliverotto began to sack sinigalia and if the duke had not repress this outrag by kill some of them they would have complet sack it night have come and the tumult be silenc the duke prepar to kill vitellozzo and oliverotto he led them into a room and caus them to be strangl neither of them use word in keep with their past live vitellozzo pray that he might ask of the pope full pardon for his sin oliverotto cring and laid the blame for all injuri against the duke on vitellozzo pagolo and the duke di gravina orsini were kept aliv until the duke heard from rome that the pope had taken the cardin orsino the archbishop of florenc and messer jacopo da santa croce after which news on 18th januari 1502 in the castl of piev they also were strangl in the same way the life of castruccio castracani of lucca written by nicolo machiavelli and sent to his friend zanobi buondelmonti and luigi alamanni castruccio castracani 1284 1328 it appear dearest zanobi and luigi a wonder thing to those who have consid the matter that all men or the larger number of them who have perform great deed in the world and excel all other in their day have had their birth and begin in base and obscur or have been aggriev by fortun in some outrag way they have either been expos to the merci of wild beast or they have had so mean a parentag that in shame they have given themselv out to be son of jove or of some other deiti it would be wearisom to relat who these person may have been becaus they are well known to everybodi and as such tale would not be particular edifi to those who read them they are omit i believ that these lowli begin of great men occur becaus fortun is desir of show to the world that such men owe much to her and littl to wisdom becaus she begin to show her hand when wisdom can realli take no part in their career thus all success must be attribut to her castruccio castracani of lucca was one of those men who did great deed if he is measur by the time in which he live and the citi in which he was born but like mani other he was neither fortun nor distinguish in his birth as the cours of this histori will show it appear to be desir to recal his memori becaus i have discern in him such indic of valour and fortun as should make him a great exemplar to men i think also that i ought to call your attent to his action becaus you of all men i know delight most in nobl deed the famili of castracani was former number among the nobl famili of lucca but in the day of which i speak it had somewhat fallen in estat as so often happen in this world to this famili was born a son antonio who becam a priest of the order of san michel of lucca and for this reason was honour with the titl of messer antonio he had an onli sister who had been marri to buonaccorso cenami but buonaccorso die she becam a widow and not wish to marri again went to live with her brother messer antonio had a vineyard behind the hous where he resid and as it was bound on all side by garden ani person could have access to it without difficulti one morn short after sunris madonna dianora as the sister of messer antonio was call had occas to go into the vineyard as usual to gather herb for season the dinner and hear a slight rustl among the leav of a vine she turn her eye in that direct and heard someth resembl the cri of an infant whereupon she went toward it and saw the hand and face of a babi who was lie envelop in the leav and who seem to be cri for it mother part wonder and part fear yet full of compass she lift it up and carri it to the hous where she wash it and cloth it with clean linen as is customari and show it to messer antonio when he return home when he heard what had happen and saw the child he was not less surpris or compassion than his sister they discuss between themselv what should be done and see that he was priest and that she had no children they final determin to bring it up they had a nurs for it and it was rear and love as if it were their own child they baptiz it and gave it the name of castruccio after their father as the year pass castruccio grew veri handsom and gave evid of wit and discret and learnt with a quick beyond his year those lesson which messer antonio impart to him messer antonio intend to make a priest of him and in time would have induct him into his canonri and other benefic and all his instruct was given with this object but antonio discov that the charact of castruccio was quit unfit for the priesthood as soon as castruccio reach the age of fourteen he began to take less notic of the chide of messer antonio and madonna dianora and no longer to fear them he left off read ecclesiast book and turn to play with arm delight in noth so much as in learn their use and in run leap and wrestl with other boy in all exercis he far excel his companion in courag and bodili strength and if at ani time he did turn to book onli those pleas him which told of war and the mighti deed of men messer antonio beheld all this with vexat and sorrow there live in the citi of lucca a gentleman of the guinigi famili name messer francesco whose profess was arm and who in rich bodili strength and valour excel all other men in lucca he had often fought under the command of the visconti of milan and as a ghibellin was the valu leader of that parti in lucca this gentleman resid in lucca and was accustom to assembl with other most morn and even under the balconi of the podesta which is at the top of the squar of san michel the finest squar in lucca and he had often seen castruccio take part with other children of the street in those game of which i have spoken notic that castruccio far excel the other boy and that he appear to exercis a royal author over them and that they love and obey him messer francesco becam great desir of learn who he was be inform of the circumst of the bring up of castruccio he felt a greater desir to have him near to him therefor he call him one day and ask him whether he would more will live in the hous of a gentleman where he would learn to ride hors and use arm or in the hous of a priest where he would learn noth but mass and the servic of the church messer francesco could see that it pleas castruccio great to hear hors and arm spoken of even though he stood silent blush modest but be encourag by messer francesco to speak he answer that if his master were agreeabl noth would pleas him more than to give up his priest studi and take up those of a soldier this repli delight messer francesco and in a veri short time he obtain the consent of messer antonio who was driven to yield by his knowledg of the natur of the lad and the fear that he would not be abl to hold him much longer thus castruccio pass from the hous of messer antonio the priest to the hous of messer francesco guinigi the soldier and it was astonish to find that in a veri short time he manifest all that virtu and bear which we are accustom to associ with a true gentleman in the first place he becam an accomplish horseman and could manag with eas the most fieri charger and in all joust and tournament although still a youth he was observ beyond all other and he excel in all exercis of strength and dexter but what enhanc so much the charm of these accomplish was the delight modesti which enabl him to avoid offenc in either act or word to other for he was deferenti to the great men modest with his equal and courteous to his inferior these gift made him belov not onli by all the guinigi famili but by all lucca when castruccio had reach his eighteenth year the ghibellin were driven from pavia by the guelph and messer francesco was sent by the visconti to assist the ghibellin and with him went castruccio in charg of his forc castruccio gave ampl proof of his prudenc and courag in this expedit acquir greater reput than ani other captain and his name and fame were known not onli in pavia but throughout all lombardi castruccio have return to lucca in far higher estim that he left it did not omit to use all the mean in his power to gain as mani friend as he could neglect none of those art which are necessari for that purpos about this time messer francesco die leav a son thirteen year of age name pagolo and have appoint castruccio to be his son tutor and administr of his estat befor he die francesco call castruccio to him and pray him to show pagolo that goodwil which he francesco had alway shown to him and to render to the son the gratitud which he had not been abl to repay to the father upon the death of francesco castruccio becam the governor and tutor of pagolo which increas enorm his power and posit and creat a certain amount of envi against him in lucca in place of the former univers goodwil for mani men suspect him of harbour tyrann intent among these the lead man was giorgio deg opizi the head of the guelph parti this man hope after the death of messer francesco to becom the chief man in lucca but it seem to him that castruccio with the great abil which he alreadi show and hold the posit of governor depriv him of his opportun therefor he began to sow those seed which should rob castruccio of his emin castruccio at first treat this with scorn but afterward he grew alarm think that messer giorgio might be abl to bring him into disgrac with the deputi of king ruberto of napl and have him driven out of lucca the lord of pisa at that time was uguccion of the faggiuola of arezzo who be in the first place elect their captain afterward becam their lord there resid in pari some exil ghibellin from lucca with whom castruccio held communic with the object of effect their restor by the help of uguccion castruccio also brought into his plan friend from lucca who would not endur the author of the opizi have fix upon a plan to be follow castruccio cautious fortifi the tower of the onesti fill it with suppli and munit of war in order that it might stand a sieg for a few day in case of need when the night came which had been agre upon with uguccion who had occupi the plain between the mountain and pisa with mani men the signal was given and without be observ uguccion approach the gate of san piero and set fire to the portculli castruccio rais a great uproar within the citi call the peopl to arm and forc open the gate from his side uguccion enter with his men pour through the town and kill messer giorgio with all his famili and mani of his friend and support the governor was driven out and the govern reform accord to the wish of uguccion to the detriment of the citi becaus it was found that more than one hundr famili were exil at that time of those who fled part went to florenc and part to pistoia which citi was the headquart of the guelph parti and for this reason it becam most hostil to uguccion and the lucches as it now appear to the florentin and other of the guelph parti that the ghibellin absorb too much power in tuscani they determin to restor the exil guelph to lucca they assembl a larg armi in the val di nievol and seiz montecatini from thenc they march to montecarlo in order to secur the free passag into lucca upon this uguccion assembl his pisan and lucches forc and with a number of german cavalri which he drew out of lombardi he move against the quarter of the florentin who upon the appear of the enemi withdrew from montecarlo and post themselv between montecatini and pescia uguccion now took up a posit near to montecarlo and within about two mile of the enemi and slight skirmish between the hors of both parti were of daili occurr owe to the ill of uguccion the pisan and lucches delay come to battl with the enemi uguccion find himself grow wors went to montecarlo to be cure and left the command of the armi in the hand of castruccio this chang brought about the ruin of the guelph who think that the hostil armi have lost it captain had lost it head grew over confid castruccio observ this and allow some day to pass in order to encourag this belief he also show sign of fear and did not allow ani of the munit of the camp to be use on the other side the guelph grew more insol the more they saw these evid of fear and everi day they drew out in the order of battl in front of the armi of castruccio present deem that the enemi was suffici embolden and have master their tactic he decid to join battl with them first he spoke a few word of encourag to his soldier and point out to them the certainti of victori if they would but obey his command castruccio had notic how the enemi had place all his best troop in the centr of the line of battl and his less reliabl men on the wing of the armi whereupon he did exact the opposit put his most valiant men on the flank while those on whom he could not so strong reli he move to the centr observ this order of battl he drew out of his line and quick came in sight of the hostil armi who as usual had come in their insol to defi him he then command his centr squadron to march slowli whilst he move rapid forward those on the wing thus when they came into contact with the enemi onli the wing of the two armi becam engag whilst the center battalion remain out of action for these two portion of the line of battl were separ from each other by a long interv and thus unabl to reach each other by this expedi the more valiant part of castruccio men were oppos to the weaker part of the enemi troop and the most effici men of the enemi were disengag and thus the florentin were unabl to fight with those who were array opposit to them or to give ani assist to their own flank so without much difficulti castruccio put the enemi to flight on both flank and the centr battalion took to flight when they found themselv expos to attack without have a chanc of display their valour the defeat was complet and the loss in men veri heavi there be more than ten thousand men kill with mani offic and knight of the guelph parti in tuscani and also mani princ who had come to help them among whom were piero the brother of king ruberto and carlo his nephew and filippo the lord of taranto on the part of castruccio the loss did not amount to more than three hundr men among whom was francesco the son of uguccion who be young and rash was kill in the first onset this victori so great increas the reput of castruccio that uguccion conceiv some jealousi and suspicion of him becaus it appear to uguccion that this victori had given him no increas of power but rather than diminish it be of this mind he onli wait for an opportun to give effect to it this occur on the death of pier agnolo mich a man of great reput and abil in lucca the murder of whom fled to the hous of castruccio for refug on the sergeant of the captain go to arrest the murder they were driven off by castruccio and the murder escap this affair come to the knowledg of uguccion who was than at pisa it appear to him a proper opportun to punish castruccio he therefor sent for his son neri who was the governor of lucca and commiss him to take castruccio prison at a banquet and put him to death castruccio fear no evil went to the governor in a friend way was entertain at supper and then thrown into prison but neri fear to put him to death lest the peopl should be incens kept him aliv in order to hear further from his father concern his intent ugucionn curs the hesit and cowardic of his son and at onc set out from pisa to lucca with four hundr horsemen to finish the busi in his own way but he had not yet reach the bath when the pisan rebel and put his deputi to death and creat count gaddo della gherardesca their lord befor uguccion reach lucca he heard of the occurr at pisa but it did not appear wise to him to turn back lest the lucches with the exampl of pisa befor them should close their gate against him but the lucches have heard of what had happen at pisa avail themselv of this opportun to demand the liber of castruccio notwithstand that uguccion had arriv in their citi they first began to speak of it in privat circl afterward open in the squar and street then they rais a tumult and with arm in their hand went to uguccion and demand that castruccio should be set at liberti uguccion fear that wors might happen releas him from prison whereupon castruccio gather his friend around him and with the help of the peopl attack uguccion who find he had no resourc but in flight rode away with his friend to lombardi to the lord of scale where he die in poverti but castruccio from be a prison becam almost a princ in lucca and he carri himself so discreet with his friend and the peopl that they appoint him captain of their armi for one year have obtain this and wish to gain renown in war he plan the recoveri of the mani town which had rebel after the departur of uguccion and with the help of the pisan with whom he had conclud a treati he march to serezzana to captur this place he construct a fort against it which is call to day zerezzanello in the cours of two month castruccio captur the town with the reput gain at that sieg he rapid seiz massa carrara and lavenza and in a short time had overrun the whole of lunigiana in order to close the pass which lead from lombardi to lunigiana he besieg pontremoli and wrest it from the hand of messer anastagio palavicini who was the lord of it after this victori he return to lucca and was welcom by the whole peopl and now castruccio deem it imprud ani longer to defer make himself a princ got himself creat the lord of lucca by the help of pazzino del poggio puccinello dal portico francesco boccansacchi and cecco guinigi all of whom he had corrupt and he was afterward solemn and deliber elect princ by the peopl at this time frederick of bavaria the king of the roman came into itali to assum the imperi crown and castruccio in order that he might make friend with him met him at the head of five hundr horsemen castruccio had left as his deputi in lucca pagolo guinigi who was held in high estim becaus of the peopl love for the memori of his father castruccio was receiv in great honour by frederick and mani privileg were confer upon him and he was appoint the emperor lieuten in tuscani at this time the pisan were in great fear of gaddo della gherardesca whom they had driven out of pisa and they had recours for assist to frederick frederick creat castruccio the lord of pisa and the pisan in dread of the guelph parti and particular of the florentin were constrain to accept him as their lord frederick have appoint a governor in rome to watch his italian affair return to germani all the tuscan and lombardian ghibellin who follow the imperi lead had recours to castruccio for help and counsel and all promis him the governorship of his countri if enabl to recov it with his assist among these exil were matteo guidi nardo scolari lapo uberti gerozzo nardi and piero buonaccorsi all exil florentin and ghibellin castruccio had the secret intent of becom the master of all tuscani by the aid of these men and of his own forc and in order to gain greater weight in affair he enter into a leagu with messer matteo visconti the princ of milan and organ for him the forc of his citi and the countri district as lucca had five gate he divid his own countri district into five part which he suppli with arm and enrol the men under captain and ensign so that he could quick bring into the field twenti thousand soldier without those whom he could summon to his assist from pisa while he surround himself with these forc and alli it happen at messer matteo visconti was attack by the guelph of piacenza who had driven out the ghibellin with the assist of a florentin armi and the king ruberto messer matteo call upon castruccio to invad the florentin in their own territori so that be attack at home they should be compel to draw their armi out of lombardi in order to defend themselv castruccio invad the valdarno and seiz fucecchio and san miniato inflict immens damag upon the countri whereupon the florentin recal their armi which had scarc reach tuscani when castruccio was forc by other necess to return to lucca there resid in the citi of lucca the poggio famili who were so power that they could not onli elev castruccio but even advanc him to the digniti of princ and it appear to them they had not receiv such reward for their servic as they deserv they incit other famili to rebel and to drive castruccio out of lucca they found their opportun one morn and arm themselv they set upon the lieuten whom castruccio had left to maintain order and kill him they endeavour to rais the peopl in revolt but stefano di poggio a peaceabl old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion interven and compel them by his author to lay down their arm and he offer to be their mediat with castruccio to obtain from him what they desir therefor they laid down their arm with no greater intellig than they had taken them up castruccio have heard the news of what had happen at lucca at onc put pagolo guinigi in command of the armi and with a troop of cavalri set out for home contrari to his expect he found the rebellion at an end yet he post his men in the most advantag place throughout the citi as it appear to stefano that castruccio ought to be veri much oblig to him he sought him out and without say anyth on his own behalf for he did not recogn ani need for do so he beg castruccio to pardon the other member of his famili by reason of their youth their former friendship and the oblig which castruccio was under to their hous to this castruccio gracious respond and beg stefano to reassur himself declar that it gave him more pleasur to find the tumult at an end than it had ever caus him anxieti to hear of it incept he encourag stefano to bring his famili to him say that he thank god for have given him the opportun of show his clemenc and liber upon the word of stefano and castruccio they surrend and with stefano were immedi thrown into prison and put to death meanwhil the florentin had recov san miniato whereupon it seem advis to castruccio to make peac as it did not appear to him that he was suffici secur at lucca to leav him he approach the florentin with the propos of a truce which they readili entertain for they were weari of the war and desir of get rid of the expens of it a treati was conclud with them for two year by which both parti agre to keep the conquest they had made castruccio thus releas from this troubl turn his attent to affair in lucca and in order that he should not again be subject to the peril from which he had just escap he under various pretenc and reason first wipe out all those who by their ambit might aspir to the princip not spare one of them but depriv them of countri and properti and those whom he had in his hand of life also state that he had found by experi that none of them were to be trust then for his further secur he rais a fortress in lucca with the stone of the tower of those whom he had kill or hunt out of the state whilst castruccio made peac with the florentin and strengthen his posit in lucca he neglect no opportun short of open war of increas his import elsewher it appear to him that if he could get possess of pistoia he would have one foot in florenc which was his great desir he therefor in various way made friend with the mountain and work matter so in pistoia that both parti confid their secret to him pistoia was divid as it alway had been into the bianchi and neri parti the head of the bianchi was bastiano di possent and of the neri jacopo da gia each of these men held secret communic with castruccio and each desir to drive the other out of the citi and after mani threaten they came to blow jacopo fortifi himself at the florentin gate bastiano at that of the lucches side of the citi both trust more in castruccio than in the florentin becaus they believ that castruccio was far more readi and will to fight than the florentin and they both sent to him for assist he gave promis to both say to bastiano that he would come in person and to jacopo that he would send his pupil pagolo guinigi at the appoint time he sent forward pagolo by way of pisa and went himself direct to pistoia at midnight both of them met outsid the citi and both were admit as friend thus the two leader enter and at a signal given by castruccio one kill jacopo da gia and the other bastiano di possent and both took prison or kill the partisan of either faction without further opposit pistoia pass into the hand of castruccio who have forc the signoria to leav the palac compel the peopl to yield obedi to him make them mani promis and remit their old debt the countrysid flock to the citi to see the new princ and all were fill with hope and quick settl down influenc in a great measur by his great valour about this time great disturb aros in rome owe to the dear of live which was caus by the absenc of the pontiff at avignon the german governor enrico was much blame for what happenedmurd and tumult follow each other daili without his be abl to put an end to them this caus enrico much anxieti lest the roman should call in ruberto the king of napl who would drive the german out of the citi and bring back the pope have no nearer friend to whom he could appli for help than castruccio he sent to him beg him not onli to give him assist but also to come in person to rome castruccio consid that he ought not to hesit to render the emperor this servic becaus he believ that he himself would not be safe if at ani time the emperor ceas to hold rome leav pagolo guinigi in command at lucca castruccio set out for rome with six hundr horsemen where he was receiv by enrico with the greatest distinct in a short time the presenc of castruccio obtain such respect for the emperor that without bloodsh or violenc good order was restor chiefli by reason of castruccio have sent by sea from the countri round pisa larg quantiti of corn and thus remov the sourc of the troubl when he had chastis some of the roman leader and admonish other voluntari obedi was render to enrico castruccio receiv mani honour and was made a roman senat this digniti was assum with the greatest pomp castruccio be cloth in a brocad toga which had the follow word embroid on it front i am what god will whilst on the back was what god desir shall be dure this time the florentin who were much enrag that castruccio should have seiz pistoia dure the truce consid how they could tempt the citi to rebel to do which they thought would not be difficult in his absenc among the exil pistoian in florenc were baldo cecchi and jacopo baldini both men of lead and readi to face danger these men kept up communic with their friend in pistoia and with the aid of the florentin enter the citi by night and after drive out some of castruccio offici and partisan and kill other they restor the citi to it freedom the news of this great anger castruccio and take leav of enrico he press on in great hast to pistoia when the florentin heard of his return know that he would lose no time they decid to intercept him with their forc in the val di nievol under the belief that by do so they would cut off his road to pistoia assembl a great armi of the support of the guelph caus the florentin enter the pistoian territori on the other hand castruccio reach montecarlo with his armi and have heard where the florentin lay he decid not to encount it in the plain of pistoia nor to await it in the plain of pescia but as far as he possibl could to attack it bold in the pass of serravall he believ that if he succeed in this design victori was assur although he was inform that the florentin had thirti thousand men whilst he had onli twelv thousand although he had everi confid in his own abil and the valour of his troop yet he hesit to attack his enemi in the open lest he should be overwhelm by number serravall is a castl between pescia and pistoia situat on a hill which block the val di nievol not in the exact pass but about a bowshot beyond the pass itself is in place narrow and steep whilst in general it ascend gentl but is still narrow especi at the summit where the water divid so that twenti men side by side could hold it the lord of serravall was manfr a german who befor castruccio becam lord of pistoia had been allow to remain in possess of the castl it be common to the lucches and the pistoian and unclaim by eitherneith of them wish to displac manfr as long as he kept his promis of neutral and came under oblig to no one for these reason and also becaus the castl was well fortifi he had alway been abl to maintain his posit it was here that castruccio had determin to fall upon his enemi for here his few men would have the advantag and there was no fear lest see the larg mass of the hostil forc befor they becam engag they should not stand as soon as this troubl with florenc aros castruccio saw the immens advantag which possess of this castl would give him and have an intim friendship with a resid in the castl he manag matter so with him that four hundr of his men were to be admit into the castl the night befor the attack on the florentin and the castellan put to death castruccio have prepar everyth had now to encourag the florentin to persist in their desir to carri the seat of war away from pistoia into the val di nievol therefor he did not move his armi from montecarlo thus the florentin hurri on until they reach their encamp under serravall intend to cross the hill on the follow morn in the meantim castruccio had seiz the castl at night had also move his armi from montecarlo and march from thenc at midnight in dead silenc had reach the foot of serravall thus he and the florentin commenc the ascent of the hill at the same time in the morn castruccio sent forward his infantri by the main road and a troop of four hundr horsemen by a path on the left toward the castl the florentin sent forward four hundr cavalri ahead of their armi which was follow never expect to find castruccio in possess of the hill nor were they awar of his have seiz the castl thus it happen that the florentin horsemen mount the hill were complet taken by surpris when they discov the infantri of castruccio and so close were they upon it they had scarc time to pull down their visor it was a case of unreadi soldier be attack by readi and they were assail with such vigour that with difficulti they could hold their own although some few of them got through when the nois of the fight reach the florentin camp below it was fill with confus the cavalri and infantri becam inextric mix the captain were unabl to get their men either backward or forward owe to the narrow of the pass and amid all this tumult no one knew what ought to be done or what could be done in a short time the cavalri who were engag with the enemi infantri were scatter or kill without have made ani effect defenc becaus of their unfortun posit although in sheer desper they had offer a stout resist retreat had been imposs with the mountain on both flank whilst in front were their enemi and in the rear their friend when castruccio saw that his men were unabl to strike a decis blow at the enemi and put them to flight he sent one thousand infantrymen round by the castl with order to join the four hundr horsemen he had previous dispatch there and command the whole forc to fall upon the flank of the enemi these order they carri out with such furi that the florentin could not sustain the attack but gave way and were soon in full retreatconqu more by their unfortun posit than by the valour of their enemi those in the rear turn toward pistoia and spread through the plain each man seek onli his own safeti the defeat was complet and veri sanguinari mani captain were taken prison among whom were bandini dei rossi francesco brunelleschi and giovanni della tosa all florentin noblemen with mani tuscan and neapolitan who fought on the florentin side have been sent by king ruberto to assist the guelph immedi the pistoian heard of this defeat they drove out the friend of the guelph and surrend to castruccio he was not content with occupi prato and all the castl on the plain on both side of the arno but march his armi into the plain of peretola about two mile from florenc here he remain mani day divid the spoil and celebr his victori with feast and game hold hors race and foot race for men and women he also struck medal in commemor of the defeat of the florentin he endeavour to corrupt some of the citizen of florenc who were to open the citi gate at night but the conspiraci was discov and the particip in it taken and behead among whom were tommaso lupacci and lambertuccio frescobaldi this defeat caus the florentin great anxieti and despair of preserv their liberti they sent envoy to king ruberto of napl offer him the dominion of their citi and he know of what immens import the mainten of the guelph caus was to him accept it he agre with the florentin to receiv from them a year tribut of two hundr thousand florin and he send his son carlo to florenc with four thousand horsemen short after this the florentin were reliev in some degre of the pressur of castruccio armi owe to his be compel to leav his posit befor florenc and march on pisa in order to suppress a conspiraci that had been rais against him by benedetto lanfranchi one of the first men in pisa who could not endur that his fatherland should be under the dominion of the lucches he had form this conspiraci intend to seiz the citadel kill the partisan of castruccio and drive out the garrison as howev in a conspiraci pauciti of number is essenti to secreci so for it execut a few are not suffici and in seek more adher to his conspiraci lanfranchi encount a person who reveal the design to castruccio this betray cannot be pass by without sever reproach to bonifacio cerchi and giovanni guidi two florentin exil who were suffer their banish in pisa thereupon castruccio seiz benedetto and put him to death and behead mani other nobl citizen and drove their famili into exil it now appear to castruccio that both pisa and pistoia were thorough disaffect he employ much thought and energi upon secur his posit there and this gave the florentin their opportun to reorgan their armi and to await the come of carlo the son of the king of napl when carlo arriv they decid to lose no more time and assembl a great armi of more than thirti thousand infantri and ten thousand cavalryhav call to their aid everi guelph there was in itali they consult whether they should attack pistoia or pisa first and decid that it would be better to march on the lattera cours owe to the recent conspiraci more like to succeed and of more advantag to them becaus they believ that the surrend of pistoia would follow the acquisit of pisa in the earli part of may 1328 the florentin put in motion this armi and quick occupi lastra signa montelupo and empoli pass from thenc on to san miniato when castruccio heard of the enorm armi which the florentin were send against him he was in no degre alarm believ that the time had now arriv when fortun would deliv the empir of tuscani into his hand for he had no reason to think that his enemi would make a better fight or had better prospect of success than at pisa or serravall he assembl twenti thousand foot soldier and four thousand horsemen and with this armi went to fucecchio whilst he sent pagolo guinigi to pisa with five thousand infantri fucecchio has a stronger posit than ani other town in the pisan district owe to it situat between the river arno and gusciana and it slight elev abov the surround plain moreov the enemi could not hinder it be victual unless they divid their forc nor could they approach it either from the direct of lucca or pisa nor could they get through to pisa or attack castruccio forc except at a disadvantag in one case they would find themselv place between his two armi the one under his own command and the other under pagolo and in the other case they would have to cross the arno to get to close quarter with the enemi an undertak of great hazard in order to tempt the florentin to take this latter cours castruccio withdrew his men from the bank of the river and place them under the wall of fucecchio leav a wide expans of land between them and the river the florentin have occupi san miniato held a council of war to decid whether they should attack pisa or the armi of castruccio and have weigh the difficulti of both cours they decid upon the latter the river arno was at that time low enough to be fordabl yet the water reach to the shoulder of the infantrymen and to the saddl of the horsemen on the morn of 10 june 1328 the florentin commenc the battl by order forward a number of cavalri and ten thousand infantri castruccio whose plan of action was fix and who well knew what to do at onc attack the florentin with five thousand infantri and three thousand horsemen not allow them to issu from the river befor he charg them he also sent one thousand light infantri up the river bank and the same number down the arno the infantri of the florentin were so much imped by their arm and the water that they were not abl to mount the bank of the river whilst the cavalri had made the passag of the river more difficult for the other by reason of the few who had cross have broken up the bed of the river and this be deep with mud mani of the hors roll over with their rider and mani of them had stuck so fast that they could not move when the florentin captain saw the difficulti their men were meet they withdrew them and move higher up the river hope to find the river bed less treacher and the bank more adapt for land these men were met at the bank by the forc which castruccio had alreadi sent forward who be light arm with buckler and javelin in their hand let fli with tremend shout into the face and bodi of the cavalri the hors alarm by the nois and the wound would not move forward and trampl each other in great confus the fight between the men of castruccio and those of the enemi who succeed in cross was sharp and terribl both side fought with the utmost desper and neither would yield the soldier of castruccio fought to drive the other back into the river whilst the florentin strove to get a foot on land in order to make room for the other press forward who if they could but get out of the water would be abl to fight and in this obstin conflict they were urg on by their captain castruccio shout to his men that these were the same enemi whom they had befor conquer at serravall whilst the florentin reproach each other that the mani should be overcom by the few at length castruccio see how long the battl had last and that both his men and the enemi were utter exhaust and that both side had mani kill and wound push forward anoth bodi of infantri to take up a posit at the rear of those who were fight he then command these latter to open their rank as if they intend to retreat and one part of them to turn to the right and anoth to the left this clear a space of which the florentin at onc took advantag and thus gain possess of a portion of the battlefield but when these tire soldier found themselv at close quarter with castruccio reserv they could not stand against them and at onc fell back into the river the cavalri of either side had not as yet gain ani decis advantag over the other becaus castruccio know his inferior in this arm had command his leader onli to stand on the defens against the attack of their adversari as he hope that when he had overcom the infantri he would be abl to make short work of the cavalri this fell out as he had hope for when he saw the florentin armi driven back across the river he order the remaind of his infantri to attack the cavalri of the enemi this they did with lanc and javelin and join by their own cavalri fell upon the enemi with the greatest furi and soon put him to flight the florentin captain have seen the difficulti their cavalri had met with in cross the river had attempt to make their infantri cross lower down the river in order to attack the flank of castruccio armi but here also the bank were steep and alreadi line by the men of castruccio and this movement was quit useless thus the florentin were so complet defeat at all point that scarc a third of them escap and castruccio was again cover with glori mani captain were taken prison and carlo the son of king ruberto with michelagnolo falconi and taddeo deg albizzi the florentin commission fled to empoli if the spoil were great the slaughter was infinit greater as might be expect in such a battl of the florentin there fell twenti thousand two hundr and thirti one men whilst castruccio lost one thousand five hundr and seventi men but fortun grow envious of the glori of castruccio took away his life just at the time when she should have preserv it and thus ruin all those plan which for so long a time he had work to carri into effect and in the success prosecut of which noth but death could have stop him castruccio was in the thick of the battl the whole of the day and when the end of it came although fatigu and overh he stood at the gate of fucecchio to welcom his men on their return from victori and person thank them he was also on the watch for ani attempt of the enemi to retriev the fortun of the day he be of the opinion that it was the duti of a good general to be the first man in the saddl and the last out of it here castruccio stood expos to a wind which often rise at midday on the bank of the arno and which is often veri unhealthi from this he took a chill of which he thought noth as he was accustom to such troubl but it was the caus of his death on the follow night he was attack with high fever which increas so rapid that the doctor saw it must prove fatal castruccio therefor call pagolo guinigi to him and address him as follow if i could have believ that fortun would have cut me off in the midst of the career which was lead to that glori which all my success promis i should have labour less and i should have left thee if a smaller state at least with fewer enemi and peril becaus i should have been content with the governorship of lucca and pisa i should neither have subjug the pistoian nor outrag the florentin with so mani injuri but i would have made both these peopl my friend and i should have live if no longer at least more peac and have left you a state without a doubt smaller but one more secur and establish on a surer foundat but fortun who insist upon have the arbitra of human affair did not endow me with suffici judgment to recogn this from the first nor the time to surmount it thou hast heard for mani have told thee and i have never conceal it how i enter the hous of thi father whilst yet a boya stranger to all those ambit which everi generous soul should feeland how i was brought up by him and love as though i had been born of his blood how under his govern i learn to be valiant and capabl of avail myself of all that fortun of which thou hast been wit when thi good father came to die he commit thee and all his possess to my care and i have brought thee up with that love and increas thi estat with that care which i was bound to show and in order that thou shouldst not onli possess the estat which thi father left but also that which my fortun and abil have gain i have never marri so that the love of children should never deflect my mind from that gratitud which i owe to the children of thi father thus i leav thee a vast estat of which i am well content but i am deepli concern inasmuch as i leav it thee unsettl and insecur thou hast the citi of lucca on thi hand which will never rest content under they govern thou hast also pisa where the men are of natur changeabl and unreli who although they may be sometim held in subject yet they will ever disdain to serv under a lucches pistoia is also disloy to thee she be eaten up with faction and deepli incens against thi famili by reason of the wrong recent inflict upon them thou hast for neighbour the offend florentin injur by us in a thousand way but not utter destroy who will hail the news of my death with more delight than they would the acquisit of all tuscani in the emperor and in the princ of milan thou canst place no relianc for they are far distant slow and their help is veri long in come therefor thou hast no hope in anyth but in thine own abil and in the memori of my valour and in the prestig which this latest victori has brought thee which as thou knowest how to use it with prudenc will assist thee to come to term with the florentin who as they are suffer under this great defeat should be inclin to listen to thee and wherea i have sought to make them my enemi becaus i believ that war with them would conduc to my power and glori thou hast everi induc to make friend of them becaus their allianc will bring thee advantag and secur it is of the greatest import in this world that a man should know himself and the measur of his own strength and mean and he who know that he has not a genius for fight must learn how to govern by the art of peac and it will be well for thee to rule they conduct by my counsel and to learn in this way to enjoy what my life work and danger have gain and in this thou wilt easili succeed when thou hast learnt to believ that what i have told thee is true and thou wilt be doubli indebt to me in that i have left thee this realm and have taught thee how to keep it after this there came to castruccio those citizen of pisa pistoia and lucca who had been fight at his side and
