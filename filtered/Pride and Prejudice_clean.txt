well he certain is veri agreeabl and i give you leav to like him you have like mani a stupid person dear lizzi oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like peopl in general you never see a fault in anybodi all the world are good and agreeabl in your eye i never heard you speak ill of a human be in your life i would not wish to be hasti in censur anyon but i alway speak what i think i know you do and it is that which make the wonder with your good sens to be so honest blind to the folli and nonsens of other affect of candour is common enoughon meet with it everywher but to be candid without ostent or designto take the good of everybodi charact and make it still better and say noth of the badbelong to you alon and so you like this man sister too do you their manner are not equal to his certain notat first but they are veri pleas women when you convers with them miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his hous and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a veri charm neighbour in her elizabeth listen in silenc but was not convinc their behaviour at the assembl had not been calcul to pleas in general and with more quick of observ and less plianci of temper than her sister and with a judgement too unassail by ani attent to herself she was veri littl dispos to approv them they were in fact veri fine ladi not defici in good humour when they were pleas nor in the power of make themselv agreeabl when they chose it but proud and conceit they were rather handsom had been educ in one of the first privat seminari in town had a fortun of twenti thousand pound were in the habit of spend more than they ought and of associ with peopl of rank and were therefor in everi respect entitl to think well of themselv and mean of other they were of a respect famili in the north of england a circumst more deepli impress on their memori than that their brother fortun and their own had been acquir by trade mr bingley inherit properti to the amount of near a hundr thousand pound from his father who had intend to purchas an estat but did not live to do it mr bingley intend it likewis and sometim made choic of his counti but as he was now provid with a good hous and the liberti of a manor it was doubt to mani of those who best knew the easi of his temper whether he might not spend the remaind of his day at netherfield and leav the next generat to purchas his sister were anxious for his have an estat of his own but though he was now onli establish as a tenant miss bingley was by no mean unwil to presid at his tablenor was mrs hurst who had marri a man of more fashion than fortun less dispos to consid his hous as her home when it suit her mr bingley had not been of age two year when he was tempt by an accident recommend to look at netherfield hous he did look at it and into it for half an hourwa pleas with the situat and the princip room satisfi with what the owner said in it prais and took it immedi between him and darci there was a veri steadi friendship in spite of great opposit of charact bingley was endear to darci by the easi open and ductil of his temper though no disposit could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appear dissatisfi on the strength of darci regard bingley had the firmest relianc and of his judgement the highest opinion in understand darci was the superior bingley was by no mean defici but darci was clever he was at the same time haughti reserv and fastidi and his manner though well bred were not invit in that respect his friend had great the advantag bingley was sure of be like wherev he appear darci was continu give offens the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembl was suffici characterist bingley had never met with more pleasant peopl or prettier girl in his life everybodi had been most kind and attent to him there had been no formal no stiff he had soon felt acquaint with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceiv an angel more beauti darci on the contrari had seen a collect of peopl in whom there was littl beauti and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none receiv either attent or pleasur miss bennet he acknowledg to be pretti but she smile too much mrs hurst and her sister allow it to be sobut still they admir her and like her and pronounc her to be a sweet girl and one whom they would not object to know more of miss bennet was therefor establish as a sweet girl and their brother felt author by such commend to think of her as he chose chapter 5 within a short walk of longbourn live a famili with whom the bennet were particular intim sir william luca had been former in trade in meryton where he had made a toler fortun and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king dure his mayoralti the distinct had perhap been felt too strong it had given him a disgust to his busi and to his resid in a small market town and in quit them both he had remov with his famili to a hous about a mile from meryton denomin from that period luca lodg where he could think with pleasur of his own import and unshackl by busi occupi himself sole in be civil to all the world for though elat by his rank it did not render him supercili on the contrari he was all attent to everybodi by natur inoffens friend and oblig his present at st jamess had made him courteous ladi luca was a veri good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuabl neighbour to mrs bennet they had sever children the eldest of them a sensibl intellig young woman about twenti seven was elizabeth intim friend that the miss lucas and the miss bennet should meet to talk over a ball was absolut necessari and the morn after the assembl brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communic you began the even well charlott said mrs bennet with civil self command to miss luca you were mr bingley first choic yes but he seem to like his second better oh you mean jane i suppos becaus he danc with her twice to be sure that did seem as if he admir herinde i rather believ he did i heard someth about itbut i hard know whatsometh about mr robinson perhap you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you mr robinson ask him how he like our meryton assembl and whether he did not think there were a great mani pretti women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his answer immedi to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinion on that point upon my word well that is veri decid indeedthat doe seem as ifbut howev it may all come to noth you know my overhear were more to the purpos than your eliza said charlott mr darci is not so well worth listen to as his friend is hepoor elizato be onli just toler i beg you would not put it into lizzi head to be vex by his ill treatment for he is such a disagre man that it would be quit a misfortun to be like by him mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without onc open his lip are you quit sure maami not there a littl mistak said jane i certain saw mr darci speak to her ayebecaus she ask him at last how he like netherfield and he could not help answer her but she said he seem quit angri at be spoke to miss bingley told me said jane that he never speak much unless among his intim acquaint with them he is remark agreeabl i do not believ a word of it my dear if he had been so veri agreeabl he would have talk to mrs long but i can guess how it was everybodi say that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long doe not keep a carriag and had come to the ball in a hack chais i do not mind his not talk to mrs long said miss luca but i wish he had danc with eliza anoth time lizzi said her mother i would not danc with him if i were you i believ maam i may safe promis you never to danc with him his pride said miss luca doe not offend me so much as pride often doe becaus there is an excus for it one cannot wonder that so veri fine a young man with famili fortun everyth in his favour should think high of himself if i may so express it he has a right to be proud that is veri true repli elizabeth and i could easili forgiv his pride if he had not mortifi mine pride observ mari who piqu herself upon the solid of her reflect is a veri common fail i believ by all that i have ever read i am convinc that it is veri common inde that human natur is particular prone to it and that there are veri few of us who do not cherish a feel of self complac on the score of some qualiti or other real or imaginari vaniti and pride are differ thing though the word are often use synonym a person may be proud without be vain pride relat more to our opinion of ourselv vaniti to what we would have other think of us if i were as rich as mr darci cri a young luca who came with his sister i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhound and drink a bottl of wine a day then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottl direct the boy protest that she should not she continu to declar that she would and the argument end onli with the visit chapter 6 the ladi of longbourn soon wait on those of netherfield the visit was soon return in due form miss bennet pleas manner grew on the goodwil of mrs hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intoler and the younger sister not worth speak to a wish of be better acquaint with them was express toward the two eldest by jane this attent was receiv with the greatest pleasur but elizabeth still saw supercili in their treatment of everybodi hard except even her sister and could not like them though their kind to jane such as it was had a valu as aris in all probabl from the influenc of their brother admir it was general evid whenev they met that he did admir her and to her it was equal evid that jane was yield to the prefer which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be veri much in love but she consid with pleasur that it was not like to be discov by the world in general sinc jane unit with great strength of feel a composur of temper and a uniform cheer of manner which would guard her from the suspicion of the impertin she mention this to her friend miss luca it may perhap be pleasant repli charlott to be abl to impos on the public in such a case but it is sometim a disadvantag to be so veri guard if a woman conceal her affect with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportun of fix him and it will then be but poor consol to believ the world equal in the dark there is so much of gratitud or vaniti in almost everi attach that it is not safe to leav ani to itself we can all begin freelya slight prefer is natur enough but there are veri few of us who have heart enough to be realli in love without encourag in nine case out of ten a women had better show more affect than she feel bingley like your sister undoubt but he may never do more than like her if she doe not help him on but she doe help him on as much as her natur will allow if i can perceiv her regard for him he must be a simpleton inde not to discov it too rememb eliza that he doe not know jane disposit as you do but if a woman is partial to a man and doe not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out perhap he must if he see enough of her but though bingley and jane meet toler often it is never for mani hour togeth and as they alway see each other in larg mix parti it is imposs that everi moment should be employ in convers togeth jane should therefor make the most of everi half hour in which she can command his attent when she is secur of him there will be more leisur for fall in love as much as she choos your plan is a good one repli elizabeth where noth is in question but the desir of be well marri and if i were determin to get a rich husband or ani husband i dare say i should adopt it but these are not jane feel she is not act by design as yet she cannot even be certain of the degre of her own regard nor of it reason she has known him onli a fortnight she danc four danc with him at meryton she saw him one morn at his own hous and has sinc dine with him in compani four time this is not quit enough to make her understand his charact not as you repres it had she mere dine with him she might onli have discov whether he had a good appetit but you must rememb that four even have also been spent togetherand four even may do a great deal yes these four even have enabl them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerc but with respect to ani other lead characterist i do not imagin that much has been unfold well said charlott i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were marri to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chanc of happi as if she were to be studi his charact for a twelvemonth happi in marriag is entir a matter of chanc if the disposit of the parti are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand it doe not advanc their felic in the least they alway continu to grow suffici unlik afterward to have their share of vexat and it is better to know as littl as possibl of the defect of the person with whom you are to pass your life you make me laugh charlott but it is not sound you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself occupi in observ mr bingley attent to her sister elizabeth was far from suspect that she was herself becom an object of some interest in the eye of his friend mr darci had at first scarc allow her to be pretti he had look at her without admir at the ball and when they next met he look at her onli to criticis but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friend that she hard had a good featur in her face than he began to find it was render uncommon intellig by the beauti express of her dark eye to this discoveri succeed some other equal mortifi though he had detect with a critic eye more than one failur of perfect symmetri in her form he was forc to acknowledg her figur to be light and pleas and in spite of his assert that her manner were not those of the fashion world he was caught by their easi play of this she was perfect unawar to her he was onli the man who made himself agreeabl nowher and who had not thought her handsom enough to danc with he began to wish to know more of her and as a step toward convers with her himself attend to her convers with other his do so drew her notic it was at sir william lucass where a larg parti were assembl what doe mr darci mean said she to charlott by listen to my convers with colonel forster that is a question which mr darci onli can answer but if he doe it ani more i shall certain let him know that i see what he is about he has a veri satir eye and if i do not begin by be impertin myself i shall soon grow afraid of him on his approach them soon afterward though without seem to have ani intent of speak miss luca defi her friend to mention such a subject to him which immedi provok elizabeth to do it she turn to him and said did you not think mr darci that i express myself uncommon well just now when i was teas colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton with great energi but it is alway a subject which make a ladi energet you are sever on us it will be her turn soon to be teas said miss luca i am go to open the instrument eliza and you know what follow you are a veri strang creatur by way of a friendalway want me to play and sing befor anybodi and everybodi if my vaniti had taken a music turn you would have been invalu but as it is i would realli rather not sit down befor those who must be in the habit of hear the veri best perform on miss lucass persev howev she ad veri well if it must be so it must and grave glanc at mr darci there is a fine old say which everybodi here is of cours familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridg and i shall keep mine to swell my song her perform was pleas though by no mean capit after a song or two and befor she could repli to the entreati of sever that she would sing again she was eager succeed at the instrument by her sister mari who have in consequ of be the onli plain one in the famili work hard for knowledg and accomplish was alway impati for display mari had neither genius nor tast and though vaniti had given her applic it had given her likewis a pedant air and conceit manner which would have injur a higher degre of excel than she had reach elizabeth easi and unaffect had

his manner of mention a countri neighbourhood i assur you there is quit as much of that go on in the countri as in town everybodi was surpris and darci after look at her for a moment turn silent away mrs bennet who fanci she had gain a complet victori over him continu her triumph i cannot see that london has ani great advantag over the countri for my part except the shop and public place the countri is a vast deal pleasant is it not mr bingley when i am in the countri he repli i never wish to leav it and when i am in town it is pretti much the same they have each their advantag and i can be equal happi in either ayethat is becaus you have the right disposit but that gentleman look at darci seem to think the countri was noth at all inde mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blush for her mother you quit mistook mr darci he onli meant that there was not such a varieti of peopl to be met with in the countri as in the town which you must acknowledg to be true certain my dear nobodi said there were but as to not meet with mani peopl in this neighbourhood i believ there are few neighbourhood larger i know we dine with four and twenti famili noth but concern for elizabeth could enabl bingley to keep his counten his sister was less delic and direct her eye toward mr darci with a veri express smile elizabeth for the sake of say someth that might turn her mother thought now ask her if charlott luca had been at longbourn sinc her come away yes she call yesterday with her father what an agreeabl man sir william is mr bingley is not he so much the man of fashion so genteel and

a fine stout healthi love it may everyth nourish what is strong alreadi but if it be onli a slight thin sort of inclin i am convinc that one good sonnet will starv it entir away darci onli smile and the general paus which ensu made elizabeth trembl lest her mother should be expos herself again she long to speak but could think of noth to say and after a short silenc mrs bennet began repeat her thank to mr bingley for his kind to jane with an apolog for troubl him also with lizzi mr bingley was unaffect civil in his answer and forc his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occas

compliment to darci carolin cri her brother becaus he doe not write with eas he studi too much for word of four syllabl do not you darci my style of write is veri differ from your oh cri miss bingley charl write in the most careless way imagin he leav out half his word and blot the rest my idea flow so rapid that i have not time to express thembi which mean my letter sometim convey no idea at all to my correspond your humil mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof noth is more deceit said darci than the appear of humil it is often onli careless of opinion and sometim an indirect boast and which of the two do you call my littl recent piec of modesti the indirect boast for you are realli proud of your defect in write becaus you consid them as proceed from a rapid of thought and careless of execut which if not estim you think at least high interest the power of do anyth with quick is alway prize much by the possessor and often without ani attent to the imperfect of the perform when you told mrs bennet this morn that if you ever resolv upon quit netherfield you should be gone in five minut you meant it to be a sort of panegyr of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so veri laudabl in a precipit which must leav veri necessari busi undon and can be of no real advantag to yourself or anyon els nay cri bingley this is too much to rememb at night all the foolish thing that were said in the morn and yet upon my honour i believ what i said of myself to be true and i believ it at this moment at least therefor i did not assum the charact of needless precipit mere to show off befor the ladi i dare say you believ it but i am by no mean convinc that you would be gone with such celer your conduct would be quit as depend on chanc as that of ani man i know and if as you were mount your hors a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probabl do it you would probabl not goand at anoth word might stay a month you have onli prove by this cri elizabeth that mr bingley did not do justic to his own disposit you have shown him off now much more than he did himself i am exceed gratifi said bingley by your convert what my friend say into a compliment on the sweet of my temper but i am afraid you are give it a turn which that gentleman did by no mean intend for he would certain think better of me if under such a circumst i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could would mr darci then consid the rash of your origin intent as aton for by your obstinaci in adher to it upon my word i cannot exact explain the matter darci must speak for himself you expect me to account for opinion which you choos to call mine but which i have never acknowledg allow the case howev to stand accord to your represent you must rememb miss bennet that the friend who is suppos to desir his return to the hous and the delay of his plan has mere desir it ask it without offer one argument in favour of it proprieti to yield readilyeasilyto the persuas of a friend is no merit with you to yield without convict is no compliment to the understand of either you appear to me mr darci to allow noth for the influenc of friendship and affect a regard for the request would often make one readili yield to a request without wait for argument to reason one into it i am not particular speak of such a case as you have suppos about mr bingley we may as well wait perhap till the circumst occur befor we discuss the discret of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinari case between friend and friend where one of them is desir by the other to chang a resolut of no veri great moment should you think ill of that person for compli with the desir without wait to be argu into it will it not be advis befor we proceed on this subject to arrang with rather more precis the degre of import which is to appertain to this request as well as the degre of intimaci subsist between the parti by all mean cri bingley let us hear all the particular not forget their compar height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be awar of i assur you that if darci were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much defer i declar i do not know a more aw object than darci on particular occas and in particular place at his own hous especi and of a sunday even when he has noth to do mr darci smile but elizabeth thought she could perceiv that he was rather offend and therefor check her laugh miss bingley warm resent the indign he had receiv in an expostul with her brother for talk such nonsens i see your design bingley said his friend you dislik an argument and want to silenc this perhap i do argument are too much like disput if you and miss bennet will defer your till i am out of the room i shall be veri thank and then you may say whatev you like of me what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrific on my side and mr darci had much better finish his letter mr darci took her advic and did finish his letter when that busi was over he appli to miss bingley and elizabeth for an indulg of some music miss bingley move with some alacr to the pianofort and after a polit request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as polit and more earnest negativ she seat herself mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employ elizabeth could not help observ as she turn over some music book that lay on the instrument how frequent mr darci eye were fix on her she hard knew how to suppos that she could be an object of admir to so great a man and yet that he should look at her becaus he dislik her was still more strang she could onli imagin howev at last that she drew his notic becaus there was someth more wrong and reprehens accord to his idea of right than in ani other person present the supposit did not pain her she like him too littl to care for his approb after play some italian song miss bingley vari the charm by a live scotch air and soon afterward mr darci draw near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclin miss bennet to seiz such an opportun of danc a reel she smile but made no answer he repeat the question with some surpris at her silenc oh said she i heard you befor but i could not immedi determin what to say in repli you want me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasur of despis my tast but i alway delight in overthrow those kind of scheme and cheat a person of their premedit contempt i have therefor made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to danc a reel at alland now despis me if you dare inde i do not dare elizabeth have rather expect to affront him was amaz at his gallantri but there was a mixtur of sweet and arch in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybodi and darci had never been so bewitch by ani woman as he was by her he realli believ that were it not for the inferior of her connect he should be in some danger miss bingley saw or suspect enough to be jealous and her great anxieti for the recoveri of her dear friend jane receiv some assist from her desir of get rid of elizabeth she often tri to provok darci into dislik her guest by talk of their suppos marriag and plan his happi in such an allianc i hope said she as they were walk togeth in the shrubberi the next day you will give your mother in law a few hint when

assur him that no one intend to play and the silenc of the whole parti on the subject seem to justifi her mr hurst had therefor noth to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofa and go to sleep darci took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs hurst princip occupi in play with her bracelet and ring join now and then in her brother convers with miss bennet miss bingley attent was quit as

they were superior to the broad face stuffi uncl phillip breath port wine who follow them into the room mr wickham was the happi man toward whom almost everi femal eye was turn and elizabeth was the happi woman by whom he final seat himself and the agreeabl manner in which he immedi fell into convers though it was onli on it be a wet night made her feel that the commonest dullest most threadbar topic might be render interest by the skill of the speaker with such rival for the notic of the fair as mr wickham and the offic mr collin seem to sink into insignific to the young ladi he certain was noth but he had still at interv a kind listen in mrs phillip and was by her watch most abund suppli with coffe and muffin when the card tabl were place he had the opportun of oblig her in turn by sit down to whist i know littl of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improv myself for in my situat in life mrs phillip was veri glad for his complianc but could not wait for his reason mr wickham did not play at whist and with readi delight was he receiv at the other tabl between elizabeth and lydia at first there seem danger of lydia engross him entir for she was a most determin talker but be likewis extrem fond of lotteri ticket she soon grew too much interest in the game too eager in make bet and exclaim after prize to have attent for anyon in particular allow for the common demand of the game mr wickham was therefor at leisur to talk to elizabeth and she was veri will to hear him though what she chiefli wish to hear she could not hope to be toldth histori of his acquaint with mr darci she dare not even mention that gentleman her curios howev was unexpect reliev mr wickham began the subject himself he inquir how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiv her answer ask in a hesit manner how long mr darci had been stay there about a month said elizabeth and then unwil to let the subject drop ad he is a man of veri larg properti in derbyshir i understand yes repli mr wickham his estat there is a nobl one a clear ten thousand per annum you could not have met with a person more capabl of give you certain inform on that head than myself for i have been connect with his famili in a particular manner from my infanc elizabeth could not but look surpris you may well be surpris miss bennet at such an assert after see as you probabl might the veri cold manner of our meet yesterday are you much acquaint with mr darci as much as i ever wish to be cri elizabeth veri warm i have spent four day in the same hous with him and i think him veri disagre i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his be agreeabl or otherwis i am not qualifi to form one i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judg it is imposs for me to be imparti but i believ your opinion of him would in general astonishand perhap you would not express it quit so strong anywher els here you are in your own famili upon my word i say no more here than i might say in ani hous in the neighbourhood except netherfield he is not at all like in hertfordshir everybodi is disgust with his pride you will not find him more favour spoken of by anyon i cannot pretend to be sorri said wickham after a short interrupt that he or that ani man should not be estim beyond their desert but with him i believ it doe not often happen the world is blind by his fortun and consequ or frighten by his high and impos manner and see him onli as he choos to be seen i should take him even on my slight acquaint to be an ill temper man wickham onli shook his head i wonder said he at the next opportun of speak whether he is like to be in this countri much longer i do not at all know but i heard noth of his go away when i was at netherfield i hope your plan in favour of the shire will not be affect by his be in the neighbourhood oh noit is not for me to be driven away by mr darci if he wish to avoid see me he must go we are not on friend term and it alway give me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoid him but what i might proclaim befor all the world a sens of veri great ill usag and most pain regret at his be what he is his father miss bennet the late mr darci was one of the best men that ever breath and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in compani with this mr darci without be griev to the soul by a thousand tender recollect his behaviour to myself has been scandal but i verili believ i could forgiv him anyth and everyth rather than his disappoint the hope and disgrac the memori of his father elizabeth found the interest of the subject increas and listen with all her heart but the delicaci of it prevent further inquiri mr wickham began to speak on more general topic meryton the neighbourhood the societi appear high pleas with all that he had yet seen and speak of the latter with gentl but veri intellig gallantri it was the prospect of constant societi and good societi he ad which was my chief induc to enter the shire i knew it to be a most respect agreeabl corp and my friend denni tempt me further by his account of their present quarter and the veri great attent and excel acquaint meryton had procur them societi i own is necessari to me i have been a disappoint man and my spirit will not bear solitud i must have employ and societi a militari life is not what i was intend for but circumst have now made it elig the church ought to have been my professioni was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possess of a most valuabl live had it pleas the gentleman we were speak of just now inde yesth late mr darci bequeath me the next present of the best live in his gift he was my godfath and excess attach to me i cannot do justic to his kind he meant to provid for me ampli and thought he had done it but when the live fell it was given elsewher good heaven cri elizabeth but how could that be how could his will be disregard whi did you not seek legal redress there was just such an inform in the term of the bequest as to give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubt the intent but mr darci chose to doubt itor to treat it as a mere condit recommend and to assert that i had forfeit all claim to it by extravag imprudencein short anyth or noth certain it is that the live becam vacant two year ago exact as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to anoth man and no less certain is it that i cannot accus myself of have realli done anyth to deserv to lose it i have a warm unguard temper and i may have spoken my opinion of him and to him too freeli i can recal noth wors but the fact is that we are veri differ sort of men and that he hate me this is quit shock he deserv to be public disgrac some time or other he will bebut it shall not be by me till i can forget his father i can never defi or expos him elizabeth honour him for such feel and thought him handsom than ever as he express them but what said she after a paus can have been his motiv what can have induc him to behav so cruelli a thorough determin dislik of mea dislik which i cannot but attribut in some measur to jealousi had the late mr darci like me less his son might have born with me better but his father uncommon attach to me irrit him i believ veri earli in life he had not a temper to bear the sort of competit in which we stoodth sort of prefer which was often given me i had not thought mr darci so bad as thisthough i have never like him i had not thought so veri ill of him i had suppos him to be despis his fellow creatur in general but did not suspect him of descend to such malici reveng such injustic such inhuman as this after a few minut reflect howev she continu i do rememb his boast one day at netherfield of the implac of his resent of his have an unforgiv temper his disposit must be dread i will not trust myself on the subject repli wickham i can hard be just to him elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaim to treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourit of his father she could have ad a young man too like you whose veri counten may vouch for your be amiablebut she content herself with and one too who had probabl been his companion from childhood connect togeth as i think you said in the closest manner we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was pass togeth inmat of the same hous share the same amus object of the same parent care my father began life in the profess which your uncl mr phillip appear to do so much credit tobut he gave up everyth to be of use to the late mr darci and devot all his time to the care of the pemberley properti he was most high esteem by mr darci a most intim confidenti friend mr darci often acknowledg himself to be under the greatest oblig to my father activ superintend and when immedi befor my father death mr darci gave him a voluntari promis of provid for me i am convinc that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitud to him as of his affect to myself how strang cri elizabeth how abomin i wonder that the veri pride of this mr darci has not made him just to you if from no better motiv that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfor dishonesti i must call it it is wonder repli wickham for almost all his action may be trace to pride and pride had often been his best friend it has connect him nearer with virtu than with ani other feel but we are none of us consist and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impuls even than pride can such abomin pride as his have ever done him good yes it has often led him to be liber and generous to give his money freeli to display hospit to assist his tenant and reliev the poor famili pride and filial pridefor he is veri proud of what his father washav done this not to appear to disgrac his famili to degener from the popular qualiti or lose the influenc of the pemberley hous is a power motiv he has also brother pride which with some brother affect make him a veri kind and care guardian of his sister and you will hear him general cri up as the most attent and best of brother what sort of girl is miss darci he shook his head i wish i could call her amiabl it give me pain to speak ill of a darci but she is too much like her brotherveri veri proud as a child she was affection and pleas and extrem fond of me and i have devot hour and hour to her amus but she is noth to me now she is a handsom girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand high accomplish sinc her father death her home has been london where a ladi live with her and superintend her educ after mani paus and mani trial of other subject elizabeth could not help revert onc more to the first and say i am astonish at his intimaci with mr bingley how can mr bingley who seem good humour itself and is i realli believ truli amiabl be in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do you know mr bingley not at all he is a sweet temper amiabl charm man he cannot know what mr darci is probabl not but mr darci can pleas where he choos he doe not want abil he can be a convers companion if he think it worth his while among those who are at all his equal in consequ he is a veri differ man from what he is to the less prosper his pride never desert him but with the rich he is liber mind just sincer ration honour and perhap agreeableallow someth for fortun and figur the whist parti soon afterward break up the player gather round the other tabl and mr collin took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs phillip the usual inquiri as to his success was made by the latter it had not been veri great he had lost everi point but when mrs phillip began to express her concern thereupon he assur her with much earnest graviti that it was not of the least import that he consid the money as a mere trifl and beg that she would not make herself uneasi i know veri well madam said he that when person sit down to a card tabl they must take their chanc of these thing and happili i am not in such circumst as to make five shill ani object there are undoubt mani who could not say the same but thank to ladi catherin de bourgh i am remov far beyond the necess of regard littl matter mr wickham attent was caught and after observ mr collin for a few moment he ask elizabeth in a low voic whether her relat was veri intim acquaint with the famili of de bourgh ladi catherin de bourgh she repli has veri late given him a live i hard know how mr collin was first introduc to her notic but he certain has not known her long you know of cours that ladi catherin de bourgh and ladi ann darci were sister consequ that she is aunt to the present mr darci no inde i did not i knew noth at all of ladi catherin connect i never heard of her exist till the day befor yesterday her daughter miss de bourgh will have a veri larg fortun and it is believ that she and her cousin will unit the two estat this inform made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley vain inde must be all her attent vain and useless her affect for his sister and her prais of himself if he were alreadi self destin for anoth mr collin said she speak high both of ladi catherin and her daughter but from some particular that he has relat of her ladyship i suspect his gratitud mislead him and that in spite of her be his patro she is an arrog conceit woman i believ her to be both in a great degre repli wickham i have not seen her for mani year but i veri well rememb that i never like her and that her manner were dictatori and insol she has the reput of be remark sensibl and clever but i rather believ she deriv part of her abil from her rank and fortun part from her authorit manner and the rest from the pride for her nephew who choos that everyon connect with him should have an understand of the first class elizabeth allow that he had given a veri ration account of it and they continu talk togeth with mutual satisfact till supper put an end to card and gave the rest of the ladi their share of mr wickham attent there could be no convers in the nois of mrs phillipss supper parti but his manner recommend him to everybodi whatev he said was said well and whatev he did done grace elizabeth went away with her head full of him she could think of noth but of mr wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr collin were onc silent lydia talk incess of lotteri ticket of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr collin in describ the civil of mr and mrs phillip protest that he did not in the least regard his loss at whist enumer all the dish at supper and repeat fear that he crowd his cousin had more to say than he could well manag befor the carriag stop at longbourn hous chapter 17 elizabeth relat to jane the next day what had pass between mr wickham and herself jane listen with astonish and concern she knew not how to believ that mr darci could be so unworthi of mr bingley regard and yet it was not in her natur to question the verac of a young man of such amiabl appear as wickham the possibl of his have endur such unkind was enough to interest all her tender feel and noth remain therefor to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accid or mistak whatev could not be otherwis explain they have both said she been deceiv i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea interest peopl have perhap misrepres each to the other it is in short imposs for us to conjectur the caus or circumst which may have alien them without actual blame on either side veri true inde and now my dear jane what have you got to say on behalf of the interest peopl who have probabl been concern in the busi do clear them too or we shall be oblig to think ill of somebodi laugh as much as you choos but you will not laugh me out of my opinion my dearest lizzi do but consid in what a disgrac light it place mr darci to be treat his father favourit in such a manner one whom his father had promis to provid for it is imposs no man of common human no man who had ani valu for his charact could be capabl of it can his most intim friend be so excess deceiv in him oh no i can much more easili believ mr bingley be impos on than that mr wickham should invent such a histori of himself as he gave me last night name fact everyth mention without ceremoni if it be not so let mr darci contradict it besid there was truth in his look it is difficult indeedit is distress one doe not know what to think i beg your pardon one know exact what to think but jane could think with certainti on onli one pointthat mr bingley if he had been impos on would have much to suffer when the affair becam public the two young ladi were summon from the shrubberi where this convers pass by the arriv of the veri person of whom they had been speak mr bingley and his sister came to give their person invit for the long expect ball at netherfield which was fix for the follow tuesday the two ladi were delight to see their dear friend again call it an age sinc they had met and repeat ask what she had been do with herself sinc their separ to the rest of the famili they paid littl attent avoid mrs bennet as much as possibl say not much to elizabeth and noth at all to the other they were soon gone again rise from their seat with an activ which took their brother by surpris and hurri off as if eager to escap from mrs bennet civil the prospect of the netherfield ball was extrem agreeabl to everi femal of the famili mrs bennet chose to consid it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particular flatter by receiv the invit from mr bingley himself instead of a ceremoni card jane pictur to herself a happi even in the societi of her two friend and the attent of her brother and elizabeth thought with pleasur of danc a great deal with mr wickham and of see a confirm of everyth in mr darci look and behaviour the happi anticip by catherin and lydia depend less on ani singl event or ani particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to danc half the even with mr wickham he was by no mean the onli partner who could satisfi them and a ball was at ani rate a ball and even mari could assur her famili that she had no disinclin for it while i can have my morn to myself said she it is enoughi think it is no sacrific to join occasion in even engag societi has claim on us all and i profess myself one of those who consid interv of recreat and amus as desir for everybodi elizabeth spirit were so high on this occas that though she did not often speak unnecessarili to mr collin she could not help ask him whether he intend to accept mr bingley invit and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the even amus and she was rather surpris to find that he entertain no scrupl whatev on that head and was veri far from dread a rebuk either from the archbishop or ladi catherin de bourgh by ventur to danc i am by no mean of the opinion i assur you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of charact to respect peopl can have ani evil tendenc and i am so far from object to danc myself that i shall hope to be honour with the hand of all my fair cousin in the cours of the even and i take this opportun of solicit your miss elizabeth for the two first danc especi a prefer which i trust my cousin jane will attribut to the right caus and not to ani disrespect for her elizabeth felt herself complet taken in she had fulli propos be engag by mr wickham for those veri danc and to have mr collin instead her liveli had never been wors time there was no help for it howev mr wickham happi and her own were perforc delay a littl longer and mr collinss propos accept with as good a grace as she could she was not the better pleas with his gallantri from the idea it suggest of someth more it now first struck her that she was select from among her sister as worthi of be mistress of hunsford parsonag and of assist to form a quadrill tabl at rose in the absenc of more elig visitor the idea soon reach to convict as she observ his increas civil toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivac and though more astonish than gratifi herself by this effect of her charm it was not long befor her mother gave her to understand that the probabl of their marriag was extrem agreeabl to her elizabeth howev did not choos to take the hint be well awar that a serious disput must be the consequ of ani repli mr collin might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepar for and talk of the younger miss bennet would have been in a veri pitiabl state at this time for from the day of the invit to the day of the ball there was such a success of rain as prevent their walk to meryton onc no aunt no offic no news could be sought afterth veri shoe rose for netherfield were got by proxi even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patienc in weather which total suspend the improv of her acquaint with mr wickham and noth less than a danc on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endur to kitti and lydia chapter 18 till elizabeth enter the draw room at netherfield and look in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coat there assembl a doubt of his be present had never occur to her the certainti of meet him had not been check by ani of those recollect that might not unreason have alarm her she had dress with more than usual care and prepar in the highest spirit for the conquest of all that remain unsubdu of his heart trust that it was not more than might be won in the cours of the even but in an instant aros the dread suspicion of his be purpos omit for mr darci pleasur in the bingley invit to the offic and though this was not exact the case the absolut fact of his absenc was pronounc by his friend denni to whom lydia eager appli and who told them that wickham had been oblig to go to town on busi the day befor and was not yet return ad with a signific smile i do not imagin his busi would have call him away just now if he had not want to avoid a certain gentleman here this part of his intellig though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assur her that darci was not less answer for wickham absenc than if her first surmis had been just everi feel of displeasur against the former was so sharpen by immedi disappoint that she could hard repli with toler civil to the polit inquiri which he direct afterward approach to make attend forbear patienc with darci was injuri to wickham she was resolv against ani sort of convers with him and turn away with a degre of ill humour which she could not wholli surmount even in speak to mr bingley whose blind partial provok her but elizabeth was not form for ill humour and though everi prospect of her own was destroy for the even it could not dwell long on her spirit and have told all her grief to charlott luca whom she had not seen for a week she was soon abl to make a voluntari transit to the odditi of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notic the first two danc howev brought a return of distress they were danc of mortif mr collin awkward and solemn apologis instead of attend and often move wrong without be awar of it gave her all the shame and miseri which a disagre partner for a coupl of danc can give the moment of her releas from him was ecstasi she danc next with an offic and had the refresh of talk of wickham and of hear that he was univers like when those danc were over she return to charlott luca and was in convers with her when she found herself sudden address by mr darci who took her so much by surpris in his applic for her hand that without know what she did she accept him he walk away again immedi and she was left to fret over her own want of presenc of mind charlott tri to consol her i dare say you will find him veri agreeabl heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortun of all to find a man agreeabl whom one is determin to hate do not wish me such an evil when the danc recommenc howev and darci approach to claim her hand charlott could not help caution her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fanci for wickham to make her appear unpleas in the eye of a man ten time his consequ elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amaz at the digniti to which she was arriv in be allow to stand opposit to mr darci and read in her neighbour look their equal amaz in behold it they stood for some time without speak a word and she began to imagin that their silenc was to last through the two danc and at first was resolv not to break it till sudden fanci that it would be the greater punish to her partner to oblig him to talk she made some slight observ on the danc he repli and was again

remark kind to him though georg wickham has treat mr darci in a most infam manner i do not know the particular but i know veri well that mr darci is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear georg wickham mention and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid includ him in his invit to the offic he was excess glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way his come into the countri at all is a most insol thing inde and i wonder how he could presum to do it i piti you miss eliza for this discoveri of your favourit guilt but realli consid his descent one could not expect much better his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrili for i have heard you accus him of noth wors than of be the son of mr darci steward and of that i can assur you he inform me himself i beg your pardon repli miss bingley turn away with a sneer excus my interferenceit was kind meant insol girl said elizabeth to herself you are much mistaken if you expect to influenc me by such a paltri attack as this i see noth in it but your own wil ignor and the malic of mr darci she then sought her eldest sister who has undertaken to make inquiri on the same subject of bingley jane met her with a smile of such sweet complac a glow of such happi express as suffici mark how well she was satisfi with the occurr of the even elizabeth instant read her feel and at that moment solicitud for wickham resent against his enemi and everyth els gave way befor the hope of jane be in the fairest way for happi i want to know said she with a

jane i have not forgotten him but i have noth satisfactori to tell you mr bingley doe not know the whole of his histori and is quit ignor of the circumst which have princip offend mr darci but he will vouch for the good conduct the probiti and honour of his friend and is perfect convinc that mr wickham has deserv much less attent from mr darci than he has receiv and i am sorri to say by his account as well as his sister mr wickham is by no mean a respect young man i am afraid he has been veri imprud and has deserv to lose mr darci regard mr bingley doe not know mr wickham himself no he never saw him till the other morn at meryton this account then is what he has receiv from mr darci i am satisfi but what doe he say of the live he doe not exact recollect the circumst though he has heard them from mr darci more than onc but he believ that it was left to him condit onli i have not a doubt of mr bingley sincer said elizabeth warm but you must excus my not be convinc by assur onli mr bingley defens of his friend was a veri abl one i dare say but sinc he is unacquaint with sever part of the stori and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall ventur to still think of both gentlemen as i did befor she then chang the discours to one more gratifi to each and on which there could be no differ of sentiment elizabeth listen with delight to the happi though modest hope which jane entertain of mr bingley regard and said all in her power to heighten her confid in it on their be join by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss luca to whose inquiri after the pleasant of her last partner she had scarc repli befor mr collin came up to them and told her with great exult that he had just been so fortun as to make a most import discoveri i have found out said he by a singular accid that there is now in the room a near relat of my patro i happen to overhear the gentleman himself mention to the young ladi who doe the honour of the hous the name of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother ladi catherin how wonder these sort of thing occur who would have thought of my meet with perhap a nephew of ladi catherin de bourgh in this assembl i am most thank that the discoveri is made in time for me to pay my respect to him which i am now go to do and trust he will excus my not have done it befor my total ignor of the connect must plead my apolog you are not go to introduc yourself to mr darci inde i am i shall entreat his pardon for not have done it earlier i believ him to be ladi catherin nephew it will be in my power to assur him that her ladyship was quit well yesterday sennight elizabeth tri hard to dissuad him from such a scheme assur him that mr darci would consid his address him without introduct as an impertin freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessari there should be ani notic on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr darci the superior in consequ to begin the acquaint mr collin listen to her with the determin air of follow his own inclin and when she ceas speak repli thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world in your excel judgement in all matter within the scope of your understand but permit me to say that there must be a wide differ between the establish form of ceremoni amongst the laiti and those which regul the clergi for give me leav to observ that i consid the cleric offic as equal in point of digniti with the highest rank in the kingdomprovid that a proper humil of behaviour is at the same time maintain you must therefor allow me to follow the dictat of my conscienc on this occas which lead me to perform what i look on as a point of duti pardon me for neglect to profit by your advic which on everi other subject shall be my constant guid though in the case befor us i consid myself more fit by educ and habitu studi to decid on what is right than a young ladi like yourself and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darci whose recept of his advanc she eager watch and whose astonish at be so address was veri evid her cousin prefac his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hear it all and saw in the motion of his lip the word apolog hunsford and ladi catherin de bourgh it vex her to see him expos himself to such a man mr darci was eye him with unrestrain wonder and when at last mr collin allow him time to speak repli with an air of distant civil mr collin howev was not discourag from speak again and mr darci contempt seem abund increas with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he onli made him a slight bow and move anoth way mr collin then return to elizabeth i have no reason i assur you said he to be dissatisfi with my recept mr darci seem much pleas with the attent he answer me with the utmost civil and even paid me the compliment of say that he was so well convinc of ladi catherin discern as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthili it was realli a veri handsom thought upon the whole i am much pleas with him as elizabeth had no longer ani interest of her own to pursu she turn her attent almost entir on her sister and mr bingley and the train of agreeabl reflect which her observ gave birth to made her perhap almost as happi as jane she saw her in idea settl in that veri hous in all the felic which a marriag of true affect could bestow and she felt capabl under such circumst of endeavour even to like bingley two sister her mother thought she plain saw were bent the same way and she determin not to ventur near her lest she might hear too much when they sat down to supper therefor she consid it a most unlucki pervers which place them within one of each other and deepli was she vex to find that her mother was talk to that one person ladi luca freeli open and of noth els but her expect that jane would soon be marri to mr bingley it was an anim subject and mrs bennet seem incap of fatigu while enumer the advantag of the match his be such a charm young man and so rich and live but three mile from them were the first point of self gratul and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sister were of jane and to be certain that they must desir the connect as much as she could do it was moreov such a promis thing for her younger daughter as jane marri so great must throw them in the way of other rich men and last it was so pleasant at her time of life to be abl to consign her singl daughter to the care of their sister that she might not be oblig to go into compani more than she like it was necessari to make this circumst a matter of pleasur becaus on such occas it is the etiquett but no one was less like than mrs bennet to find comfort in stay home at ani period of her life she conclud with mani good wish that ladi luca might soon be equal fortun though evid and triumphant believ there was no chanc of it in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapid of her mother word or persuad her to describ her felic in a less audibl whisper for to her inexpress vexat she could perceiv that the chief of it was overheard by mr darci who sat opposit to them her mother onli scold her for be nonsens what is mr darci to me pray that i should be afraid of him i am sure we owe him no such particular civil as to be oblig to say noth he may not like to hear for heaven sake madam speak lower what advantag can it be for you to offend mr darci you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so do noth that she could say howev had ani influenc her mother would talk of her view in the same intellig tone elizabeth blush and blush again with shame and vexat she could not help frequent glanc her eye at mr darci though everi glanc convinc her of what she dread for though he was not alway look at her mother she was convinc that his attent was invari fix by her the express of his face chang gradual from indign contempt to a compos and steadi graviti at length howev mrs bennet had no more to say and ladi luca who had been long yawn at the repetit of delight which she saw no likelihood of share was left to the comfort of cold ham and chicken elizabeth now began to reviv but not long was the interv of tranquil for when supper was over sing was talk of and she had the mortif of see mari after veri littl entreati prepar to oblig the compani by mani signific look and silent entreati did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complais but in vain mari would not understand them such an opportun of exhibit was delight to her and she began her song elizabeth eye were fix on her with most pain sensat and she watch her progress through the sever stanza with an impati which was veri ill reward at their close for mari on receiv amongst the thank of the tabl the hint of a hope that she might be prevail on to favour them again after the paus of half a minut began anoth mari power were by no mean fit for such a display her voic was weak and her manner affect elizabeth was in agoni she look at jane to see how she bore it but jane was veri compos talk to bingley she look at his two sister and saw them make sign of deris at each other and at darci who continu howev imperturb grave she look at her father to entreat his interfer lest mari should be sing all night he took the hint and when mari had finish her second song said aloud that will do extrem well child you have delight us long enough let the other young ladi have time to exhibit mari though pretend not to hear was somewhat disconcert and elizabeth sorri for her and sorri for her father speech was afraid her anxieti had done no good other of the parti were now appli to if i said mr collin were so fortun as to be abl to sing i should have great pleasur i am sure in oblig the compani with an air for i consid music as a veri innoc divers and perfect compat with the profess of a clergyman i do not mean howev to assert that we can be justifi in devot too much of our time to music for there are certain other thing to be attend to the rector of a parish has much to do in the first place he must make such an agreement for tith as may be benefici to himself and not offens to his patron he must write his own sermon and the time that remain will not be too much for his parish duti and the care and improv of his dwell which he cannot be excus from make as comfort as possibl and i do not think it of light import that he should have attent and conciliatori manner toward everybodi especi toward those to whom he owe his prefer i cannot acquit him of that duti nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occas of testifi his respect toward anybodi connect with the famili and with a bow to mr darci he conclud his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room mani staredmani smile but no one look more amus than mr bennet himself while his wife serious commend mr collin for have spoken so sensibl and observ in a half whisper to ladi luca that he was a remark clever good kind of young man to elizabeth it appear that had her famili made an agreement to expos themselv as much as they could dure the even it would have been imposs for them to play their part with more spirit or finer success and happi did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibit had escap his notic and that his feel were not of a sort to be much distress by the folli which he must have wit that his two sister and mr darci howev should have such an opportun of ridicul her relat was bad enough and she could not determin whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insol smile of the ladi were more intoler the rest of the even brought her littl amus she was teas by mr collin who continu most persev by her side and though he could not prevail on her to danc with him again put it out of her power to danc with other in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebodi els and offer to introduc him to ani young ladi in the room he assur her that as to danc he was perfect indiffer to it that his chief object was by delic attent to recommend himself to her and that he should therefor make a point of remain close to her the whole even there was no argu upon such a project she owe her greatest relief to her friend miss luca who often join them and good natur engag mr collinss convers to herself she was at least free from the offens of mr darci further notic though often stand within a veri short distanc of her quit disengag he never came near enough to speak she felt it to be the probabl consequ of her allus to mr wickham and rejoic in it the longbourn parti were the last of all the compani to depart and by a manoeuvr of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriag a quarter of an hour after everybodi els was gone which gave them time to see how heartili they were wish away by some of the famili mrs hurst and her sister scarc open their mouth except to complain of fatigu and were evid impati to have the hous to themselv they repuls everi attempt of mrs bennet at convers and by so do threw a languor over the whole parti which was veri littl reliev by the long speech of mr collin who was compliment mr bingley and his sister on the eleg of their entertain and the hospit and polit which had mark their behaviour to their guest darci said noth at all mr bennet in equal silenc was enjoy the scene mr bingley and jane were stand togeth a littl detach from the rest and talk onli to each other elizabeth preserv as steadi a silenc as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigu to utter more than the occasion exclam of lord how tire i am accompani by a violent yawn when at length they aros to take leav mrs bennet was most press civil in her hope of see the whole famili soon at longbourn and address herself especi to mr bingley to assur him how happi he would make them by eat a famili dinner with them at ani time without the ceremoni of a formal invit bingley was all grate pleasur and he readili engag for take the earliest opportun of wait on her after his return from london whither he was oblig to go the next day for a short time mrs bennet was perfect satisfi and quit the hous under the delight persuas that allow for the necessari prepar of settlement new carriag and wed cloth she should undoubt see her daughter settl at netherfield in the cours of three or four month of have anoth daughter marri to mr collin she thought with equal certainti and with consider though not equal pleasur elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quit good enough for her the worth of each was eclips by mr bingley and netherfield chapter 19 the next day open a new scene at longbourn mr collin made his declar in form have resolv to do it

fair cousin that i do not reckon the notic and kind of ladi catherin de bourgh as among the least of the advantag in my power to offer you will find her manner beyond anyth i can describ and your wit and vivac i think must be accept to her especi when temper with the silenc and respect which her rank will inevit excit thus much for my general intent in favour of matrimoni it remain to be told whi my view were direct toward longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i can assur you there are mani amiabl young women but the fact is that be as i am to inherit this estat after the death of your honour father who howev may live mani year longer i could not satisfi myself without resolv to choos a wife from among his daughter that the loss to them might be as littl as possibl when the melancholi event take placewhich howev as i have alreadi said may not be for sever year this has been my motiv my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now noth remain for me but to assur you in the most anim languag of the violenc of my affect to fortun i am perfect indiffer and shall make no demand of that natur on your father sinc i am well awar that it could not be compli with and that one thousand pound in the four per cent which will not be your till after your mother deceas is all that you may ever be entitl to on that head therefor i shall be uniform silent and you may assur yourself that no ungener reproach shall ever pass my lip when we are marri it was absolut necessari to interrupt him now you are too hasti sir she cri you forget that i have made no answer let me do it without further loss of time accept my thank for the compliment you are pay me i am veri sensibl of the honour of your propos but it is imposs for me to do otherwis than to declin them i am not now to learn repli mr collin with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladi to reject the address of the man whom they secret mean to accept when he first appli for their favour and that sometim the refus is repeat a second or even a third time i am therefor by no mean discourag by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long upon my word sir cri elizabeth your hope is a rather extraordinari one after my declar i do assur you that i am not one of those young ladi if such young ladi there are who are so dare as to risk their happi on the chanc of be ask a second time i am perfect serious in my refus you could not make me happi and i am convinc that i am the last woman in the world who could make you so nay were your friend ladi catherin to know me i am persuad she would find me in everi respect ill qualifi for the situat were it certain that ladi catherin would think so said mr collin veri gravelybut i cannot imagin that her ladyship would at all disapprov of you and you may be certain when i have the honour of see her again i shall speak in the veri highest term of your modesti economi and other amiabl qualif inde mr collin all prais of me will be unnecessari you must give me leav to judg for myself and pay me the compliment of believ what i say i wish you veri happi and veri rich and by refus your

of your sex to reject a man on the first applic and perhap you have even now said as much to encourag my suit as would be consist with the true delicaci of the femal charact realli mr collin cri elizabeth with some warmth you puzzl me exceed if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encourag i know not how to express my refus in such a way as to convinc you of it be one you must give me leav to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refus of my address is mere word of cours my reason for believ it are briefli these it doe not appear to me that my hand is unworthi your accept or that the establish i can offer would be ani other than high desir my situat in life my connect with the famili of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumst high in my favour and you should take it into further consider that in spite of your manifold attract it is by no mean certain that anoth offer of marriag may ever be made you your portion is unhappili so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effect of your loveli and amiabl qualif as i must therefor conclud that you are not serious in your reject of me i shall choos to attribut it to your wish of

be mistaken for the affect and coquetri of an eleg femal chapter 20 mr collin was not left long to the silent contempl of his success love for mrs bennet have dawdl about in the vestibul to watch for the end of the confer no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her toward the staircas than she enter the breakfast room and congratul both him and herself in warm term on the happi prospect or their nearer connect mr collin receiv and return these felicit with equal pleasur and then proceed to relat the particular of their interview with the result of which he trust he had everi reason to be satisfi sinc the refus which his cousin had steadfast given him would natur flow from her bash modesti and the genuin delicaci of her charact this inform howev startl mrs bennet she would have been glad to be equal satisfi that her daughter had meant to encourag him by protest against his propos but she dare not believ it and could not help say so but depend upon it mr collin she ad that lizzi shall be brought to reason i will speak to her about it direct she is a veri headstrong foolish girl and doe not know her own interest but i will make her know it pardon me for interrupt you madam cri mr collin but if she is realli headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogeth be a veri desir wife to a man in my situat who natur look for happi in the marriag state if therefor she actual persist in reject my suit perhap it were better not to forc her into accept me becaus if liabl to such defect of temper she could not contribut much to my felic sir you quit misunderstand me said mrs bennet alarm lizzi is onli headstrong in such matter as these in everyth els she is as good natur a girl as ever live i will go direct to mr bennet and we shall veri soon

elizabeth howev he voluntarili acknowledg that the necess of his absenc had been self impos i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darci that to be in the same room the same parti with him for so mani hour togeth might be more than i could bear and that scene might aris unpleas to more than myself she high approv his forbear and they had leisur for a full discuss of it and for all the commend which they civilli bestow on each other as wickham and anoth offic walk back with them to longbourn and dure the walk he particular attend to her his accompani them was a doubl advantag she felt all the compliment it offer to herself and it was most accept as an occas of introduc him to her father and mother soon after their return a letter was deliv to miss bennet it

return of that delight intercours we have known and in the meanwhil may lessen the pain of separ by a veri frequent and most unreserv correspond i depend on you for that to these highflown express elizabeth listen with all the insens of distrust and though the sudden of their remov surpris her she saw noth in it realli to lament it was not to be suppos that their absenc from netherfield would prevent mr bingley be there and as to the loss of their societi she was persuad that jane must ceas to regard it in the enjoy of his it is unlucki said she after a short paus that you should not be abl to see your friend befor they leav the countri but may we not hope that the period of futur happi to which miss bingley look forward may arriv earlier than she is awar and that the delight intercours you have known as friend will be renew with yet greater satisfact as sister mr bingley will not be detain in london by them carolin decid say that none of the parti will return into hertfordshir this winter i will read it to you when my brother left us yesterday he imagin that the busi which took him to london might be conclud in three or four day but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinc that when charl get to town he will be in no hurri to leav it again we have determin on follow him thither that he may not be oblig to spend his vacant hour in a comfortless hotel mani of my acquaint are alreadi there for the winter i wish that i could hear that you my dearest friend had ani intent of make one of the crowdbut of that i despair i sincer hope your christma in hertfordshir may abound in the gaieti which that season general bring and that your beaux will be so numer as to prevent your feel the loss of the three of whom we shall depriv you it is evid by this ad jane that he come back no more this winter it is onli evid that miss bingley doe not mean that he should whi will you think so it must be his own do he is his own master but you do not know all i will read you the passag which particular hurt me i will have no reserv from you mr darci is impati to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarc less eager to meet her again i realli do not think georgiana darci has her equal for beauti eleg and accomplish and the affect she inspir in louisa and myself is heighten into someth still more interest from the hope we dare entertain of her be hereaft our sister i do not know whether i ever befor mention to you my feel on this subject but i will not leav the countri without confid them and i trust you will not esteem them unreason my brother admir her great alreadi he will have frequent opportun now of see her on the most intim foot her relat all wish the connect as much as his own and a sister partial is not mislead me i think when i call charl most capabl of engag ani woman heart with all these circumst to favour an attach and noth to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulg the hope of an event which will secur the happi of so mani what do you think of this sentenc my dear lizzi said jane as she finish it is it not clear enough doe it not expressli declar that carolin neither expect nor wish me to be her sister that she is perfect convinc of her brother indiffer and that if she suspect the natur of my feel for him she mean most kind to put me on my guard can there be ani other opinion on the subject yes there can for mine is total differ will you hear it most will you shall have it in a few word miss bingley see that her brother is in love with you and want him to marri miss darci she follow him to town in hope of keep him there and tri to persuad you that he doe not care about you jane shook her head inde jane you ought to believ me no one who has ever seen you togeth can doubt his affect miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr darci for herself she would have order her wed cloth but the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darci for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriag she may have less troubl in achiev a second in which there is certain some ingenu and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot serious imagin that becaus miss bingley tell you her brother great admir miss darci he is in the smallest degre less sensibl of your merit than when he took leav of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuad him that instead of be in love with you he is veri much in love with her friend if we thought alik of miss bingley repli jane your represent of all this might make me quit easi but i know the foundat is unjust carolin is incap of wil deceiv anyon and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceiv herself that is right you could not have start a more happi idea sinc you will not take comfort in mine believ her to be deceiv by all mean you have now done your duti by her and must fret no longer but my dear sister can i be happi even suppos the best in accept a man whose sister and friend are all wish him to marri elsewher you must decid for yourself said elizabeth and if upon matur deliber you find that the miseri of disoblig his two sister is more than equival to the happi of be his wife i advis you by all mean to refus him how can you talk so said jane faint smile you must know that though i should be exceed griev at their disapprob i could not hesit i did not think you would and that be the case i cannot consid your situat with much compass but if he return no more this winter my choic will never be requir a thousand thing may aris in six month the idea of his return no more elizabeth treat with the utmost contempt it appear to her mere the suggest of carolin interest wish and she could not for a moment suppos that those wish howev open or art spoken could influenc a young man so total independ of everyon she repres to her sister as forcibl as possibl what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasur of see it happi effect jane temper was not despond and she was gradual led to hope though the diffid of affect sometim overcam the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer everi wish of her heart they agre that mrs bennet should onli hear of the departur of the famili without be alarm on the score of the gentleman conduct but even this partial communic gave her a great deal of concern and she bewail it as exceed unlucki that the ladi should happen to go away just as they were all get so intim togeth after lament it howev at some length she had the consol that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dine at longbourn and the conclus of all was the comfort declar that though he had been invit onli to a famili dinner she would take care to have two full cours chapter 22 the bennet were engag to dine with the lucas and again dure the chief of the

that both he and his wife should make their appear at st jamess the whole famili in short were proper overjoy on the occas the younger girl form hope of come out a year or two sooner than they might otherwis have done and the boy were reliev from their apprehens of charlott die an old maid charlott herself was toler compos she had gain her point and had time to consid of it her reflect were in general satisfactori mr collin to be sure was neither sensibl nor agreeabl his societi was irksom and his attach to her must be imaginari but still he would be her husband without think high either of

younger girl and mari might have been prevail on to accept him she rate his abil much higher than ani of the other there was a solid in his reflect which often struck her and though by no mean so clever as herself she thought that if encourag to read and improv himself by such an exampl as her he might becom a veri agreeabl companion but on the follow morn everi hope of this kind was done away miss luca call soon after breakfast and in a privat confer with elizabeth relat the event of the day befor the possibl of mr collinss fanci himself in love with her friend had onc occur to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlott could encourag him seem almost as far from possibl as she could encourag him herself and her astonish was consequ so great as to overcom at first the bound

return to the rest of the famili charlott did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard it was a long time befor she becam at all reconcil to the idea of so unsuit a match the strang of mr collinss make two offer of marriag within three day was noth in comparison of his be now accept she had alway felt that charlott opinion of matrimoni was not exact like her own but she had not suppos it to be possibl that when call into action she would have sacrif everi better feel to world advantag charlott the wife of mr collin was a most humili pictur and to the pang of a friend disgrac herself and sunk in her esteem was ad the distress convict that it was imposs for that friend to be toler happi in the lot she had chosen chapter 23 elizabeth was sit with her mother and sister reflect on what she had heard and doubt whether she was authoris to mention it when sir william luca himself appear sent by his daughter to announc her engag to the famili with mani compliment to them and much self gratul on the prospect of a connect between the hous he unfold the matterto an audienc not mere wonder but incredul for mrs bennet with more persever than polit protest he must be entir mistaken and lydia alway unguard and often uncivil boister exclaim good lord sir william how can you tell such a stori do not you know that mr collin want to marri lizzi noth less than the complais of a courtier could have born without anger such treatment but sir william good breed carri him through it all and though he beg leav to be posit as to the truth of his inform he listen to all their impertin with the most forbear courtesi elizabeth feel it incumb on her to reliev him from so unpleas a situat now put herself forward to confirm his account by mention her prior knowledg of it from charlott herself and endeavour to put a stop to the exclam of her mother and sister by the earnest of her congratul to sir william in which she was readili join by jane and by make a varieti of remark on the happi that might be expect from the match the excel charact of mr collin and the conveni distanc of hunsford from london mrs bennet was in fact too much overpow to say a great deal while sir william remain but no sooner had he left them than her feel found a rapid vent in the first place she persist in disbeliev the whole of the matter second she was veri sure that mr collin had been taken in third she trust that they would never be happi togeth and fourth that the match might be broken off two infer howev were plain deduc from the whole one that elizabeth was the real caus of the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbar misus by them all and on these two point she princip dwelt dure the rest of the day noth could consol and noth could appeas her nor did that day wear out her resent a week elaps befor she could see elizabeth without scold her a month pass away befor she could speak to sir william or ladi luca without be rude and mani month were gone befor she could at all forgiv their daughter mr bennet emot were much more tranquil on the occas and such as he did experi he pronounc to be of a most agreeabl sort for it gratifi him he said to discov that charlott luca whom he had been use to think toler sensibl was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter jane confess herself a littl surpris at the match but she said less of her astonish than of her earnest desir for their happi nor could elizabeth persuad her to consid it as improb kitti and lydia were far from envi miss luca for mr collin was onli a clergyman and it affect them in no other way than as a piec of news to spread at meryton ladi luca could not be insens of triumph on be abl to retort on mrs bennet the comfort of have a daughter well marri and she call at longbourn rather often than usual to say how happi she was though mrs bennet sour look and ill natur remark might have been enough to drive happi away between elizabeth and charlott there was a restraint which kept them mutual silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuad that no real confid could ever subsist between them again her disappoint in charlott made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitud and delicaci she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happi she grew daili more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and noth more was heard of his return jane had sent carolin an earli answer to her letter and was count the day till she might reason hope to hear again the promis letter of thank from mr collin arriv

to close with their kind wish of see him again at longbourn whither he hope to be abl to return on monday fortnight for ladi catherin he ad so heartili approv his marriag that she wish it to take place as soon as possibl which he trust would be an unanswer argument with his amiabl charlott to name an earli day for make him the happiest of men mr collinss return into hertfordshir was no longer a matter of pleasur to mrs bennet on the contrari she was as much dispos to complain of it as her husband it was veri strang that he should come to longbourn instead of to luca lodg it was also veri inconveni and exceed troublesom she hate have visitor in the hous while her health was so indiffer and lover were of all peopl the most disagre such were the gentl murmur of mrs bennet and they gave way onli to the greater distress of mr bingley continu absenc neither jane nor elizabeth were comfort on this subject day after day pass away without bring ani other tide of him than the report which

for the strength of his attach as for jane her anxieti under this suspens was of cours more pain than elizabeth but whatev she felt she was desir of conceal and between herself and elizabeth therefor the subject was never allud to but as no such delicaci restrain her mother an hour seldom pass in which she did not talk of bingley express her impati for his arriv or even requir jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself veri ill use it need all jane steadi mild to bear these attack with toler tranquil mr collin return most punctual on monday fortnight but his recept at

compani the chief of everi day was spent by him at luca lodg and he sometim return to longbourn onli in time to make an apolog for his absenc befor the famili went to bed mrs bennet was realli in a most pitiabl state the veri mention of anyth concern the match threw her into an agoni of ill humour and wherev she went she was sure of hear it talk of the sight of miss luca was odious to her as her successor in that hous she regard her with jealous abhorr whenev charlott came to see them she conclud her to be anticip the hour of possess and whenev she spoke in a low voic to mr collin was convinc that they were talk of the longbourn estat and resolv to turn herself and her daughter out of the hous as soon as mr bennet were dead she complain bitter of all this to her husband inde mr bennet said she it is veri hard to think that charlott luca should ever be mistress of this hous that i should be forc to make way for her and live to see her take her place in it my dear do not give way to such gloomi thought let us hope for better thing let us flatter ourselv that i may be the survivor this was not veri consol to mrs bennet and therefor instead of make ani answer she went on as befor i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estat if it was not for the entail i should not mind it what should not you mind i should not mind anyth at all let us be thank that you are preserv

chief of all this heard it in silent indign her heart was divid between concern for her sister and resent against all other to carolin assert of her brother be partial to miss darci she paid no credit that he was realli fond of jane she doubt no more than she had ever done and much as she had alway been dispos to like him she could not think without anger hard without contempt on that easi of

mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she give me by her continu reflect on him but i will not repin it cannot last long he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were befor elizabeth look at her sister with incredul solicitud but said noth you doubt me cri jane slight colour inde you have no reason he may live in my memori as the most amiabl man of my acquaint but that is all i have noth either to hope or fear and noth to reproach him with thank god i have not that pain a littl time thereforei shall certain tri to get the better with a stronger voic she soon ad i have this comfort immedi that it has not been more than an error of fanci on my side and that it has done no harm to anyon but myself my dear jane exclaim elizabeth you are too good your sweet and disinterested are realli angel i do not know what to say to you i feel as if i had never done you justic or love you as you deserv miss bennet eager disclaim all extraordinari merit and threw back the prais on her sister warm affect nay said elizabeth this is not fair you wish to think all the world respect and are hurt if i speak ill of anybodi i onli want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be afraid of my run into ani excess of my encroach on your privileg of univers good will you need not there are few peopl whom i realli love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfi with it and everi day confirm my belief of the inconsist of all human charact and of the littl depend that can be place on the appear of merit or sens i have met with two instanc late one i will not mention the other is charlott marriag it is unaccount in everi view it is unaccount my dear lizzi do not give way to such feel as these they will ruin your happi you do not make allow enough for differ of situat and temper consid mr collinss respect and charlott steadi prudent charact rememb that she is one of a larg famili that as to fortun it is a most elig match and be readi to believ for everybodi sake that she may feel someth like regard and esteem for our cousin to oblig you i would tri to believ almost anyth but no one els could be benefit by such a belief as this for were i persuad that charlott had ani regard for him i should onli think wors of her understand than i now do of her heart my dear jane mr collin is a conceit pompous narrow mind silli man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marri him cannot have a proper way of think you shall not defend her though it is charlott luca you shall not for the sake of one individu chang the mean of principl and integr nor endeavour to persuad yourself or me that selfish is prudenc and insens of danger secur for happi i must think your languag too strong in speak of both repli jane and i hope you will be convinc of it by see them happi togeth but enough of this you allud to someth els you mention two instanc i cannot misunderstand you but i entreat you dear lizzi not to pain me by think that person to blame and say your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so readi to fanci ourselv intent injur we must not expect a live young man to be alway so guard and circumspect it is veri often noth but our own vaniti that deceiv us women fanci admir mean more than it doe and men take care that they should if it is design done they cannot be justifi but i have no idea of there be so much design in the world as some person imagin i am far from attribut ani part of mr bingley conduct to design said elizabeth but without scheme to do wrong or to make other unhappi there may be error and there may be miseri thoughtless want of attent to other peopl feel and want of resolut will do the busi and do you imput it to either of those yes to the last but if i go on i shall displeas you by say what i think of person you esteem stop me whilst you can you persist then in suppos his sister influenc him yes in conjunct with his friend i cannot believ it whi should they tri to influenc him they can onli wish his happi and if he is attach to me no other woman can secur it your first posit is fals they may wish mani thing besid his happi they may wish his increas of wealth and consequ they may wish him to marri a girl who has all the import of money great connect and pride beyond a doubt they do wish him to choos miss darci repli jane but this may be from better feel than you are suppos they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatev may be their own wish it is veri unlik they should have oppos their brother what sister would think herself at liberti to do it unless there were someth veri objection if they believ him attach to me they would not tri to part us if he were so they could not succeed by suppos such an affect you make everybodi act unnatur and wrong and me most unhappi do not distress me by the idea i am not asham of have been mistakenor at least it is light it is noth in comparison of what i should feel in think ill of him or his sister let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood elizabeth could not oppos such a wish and from this time mr bingley name was scarc ever mention between them mrs bennet still continu to wonder and repin at his return no more and though a day seldom pass in which elizabeth did not account for it clear there was littl chanc of her ever consid it with less perplex her daughter endeavour to convinc her of what she did not believ herself that his attent to jane had been mere the effect of a common and transient like which ceas when he saw her no more but though the probabl of the statement was admit at the time she had the same stori to repeat everi day mrs bennet best comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer mr bennet treat the matter differ so lizzi said he one day your sister is cross in love i find i congratul her next to be marri a girl like to be cross a littl in love now and then it is someth to think of and it give her a sort of distinct among her companion when is your turn to come you will hard bear to be long outdon by jane now is your time here are offic enough in meryton to disappoint all the young ladi in the countri let wickham be your man he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you credit thank you sir but a less agreeabl man would satisfi me we must not all expect jane good fortun true said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatev of that kind may befal you you have an affection mother who will make the most of it mr wickham societi was of materi servic in dispel the gloom which the late pervers occurr had thrown on mani of the longbourn famili they saw him often and to his other recommend was now ad that of general unreserv the whole of what elizabeth had alreadi heard his claim on mr darci and all that he had suffer from him was now open acknowledg and public canvass and everybodi was pleas to know how much they had alway dislik mr darci befor they had known anyth of the matter miss bennet was the onli creatur who could suppos there might be ani extenu circumst in the case unknown to the societi of hertfordshir her mild and steadi candour alway plead for allow and urg the possibl of mistakesbut by everybodi els mr darci was condemn as the worst of men chapter 25 after a week spent in profess of love and scheme of felic mr collin was call from his amiabl charlott by the arriv of saturday the pain of separ howev might be allevi on his side by prepar for the recept of his bride as he had reason to hope that short after his return into hertfordshir the day would be fix that was to make him the happiest of men he took leav of his relat at longbourn with as much solemn as befor wish his fair cousin health and happi again and promis their father anoth letter of thank on the follow monday mrs bennet had the pleasur of receiv her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christma at longbourn mr gardin was a sensibl gentlemanlik man great superior to his sister as well by natur as educ the netherfield ladi would have had difficulti in believ that a man who live by trade and within view of his own warehous could have been so well bred and agreeabl mrs gardin who was sever year younger than mrs bennet and mrs phillip was an amiabl intellig eleg woman and a great favourit with all her longbourn niec between the two eldest and herself especi there subsist a particular regard they had frequent been stay with her in town the first part of mrs gardin busi on her arriv was to distribut her present and describ the newest fashion when this was done she had a less activ part to play it becam her turn to listen mrs bennet had mani grievanc to relat and much to complain of they had all been veri ill use sinc she last saw her sister two of her girl had been upon the point of marriag and after all there was noth in it i do not blame jane she continu for jane would have got mr bingley if she could but lizzi oh sister it is veri hard to think that she might have been mr collinss wife by this time had it not been for her own pervers he made her an offer in this veri room and she refus him the consequ of it is that ladi luca will have a daughter marri befor i have and that the longbourn estat is just as much entail as ever the lucas are veri art peopl inde sister they are all for what they can get i am sorri to say it of them but so it is it make me veri nervous and poor to be thwart so in my own famili and to have neighbour who think of themselv befor anybodi els howev your come just at this time is the greatest of comfort and i am veri glad to hear what you tell us of long sleev mrs gardin to whom the chief of this news had been given befor in the cours of jane and elizabeth correspond with her made her sister a slight answer and in compass to her niec turn the convers when alon with elizabeth afterward she spoke more on the subject it seem like to have been a desir match for jane said she i am sorri it went off but these thing happen so often a young man such as you describ mr bingley so easili fall in love with a pretti girl for a few week and when accid separ them so easili forget her that these sort of inconsist are veri frequent an excel consol in it way said elizabeth but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accid it doe not often happen that the interfer of friend will persuad a young man of independ fortun to think no more of a girl whom he was violent in love with onli a few day befor but that express of violent in love is so hackney so doubt so indefinit that it give me veri littl idea it is as often appli to feel which aris from a half hour acquaint as to a real strong attach pray how violent was mr bingley love i never saw a more promis inclin he was grow quit inattent to other peopl and wholli engross by her everi time they met it was more decid and remark at his own ball he offend two or three young ladi by not ask them to danc and i spoke to him twice myself without receiv an answer could there be finer symptom is not general incivil the veri essenc of love oh yesof that kind of love which i suppos him to have felt poor jane i am sorri for her becaus with her disposit she may not get over it immedi it had better have happen to you lizzi you would have laugh yourself out of it sooner but do you think she would be prevail upon to go back with us chang of scene might be of serviceand perhap a littl relief from home may be as use as anyth elizabeth was exceed pleas with this propos and felt persuad of her sister readi acquiesc i hope ad mrs gardin that no consider with regard to this young man will influenc her we live in so differ a part of town all our connect are so differ and as you well know we go out so littl that it is veri improb that they should meet at all unless he realli come to see her and that is quit imposs for he is now in the custodi of his friend and mr darci would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr darci may perhap have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hard think a month ablut enough to cleans him from it impur were he onc to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley never stir without him so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but doe not jane correspond with his sister she will not be abl to help call she will drop the acquaint entir but in spite of the certainti in which elizabeth affect to place this point as well as the still more interest one of bingley be withheld from see jane she felt a solicitud on the subject which convinc her on examin that she did not consid it entir hopeless it was possibl and sometim she thought it probabl that his affect might be reanim and the influenc of his friend success combat by the more natur influenc of jane attract miss bennet accept her aunt invit with pleasur and the bingley were no otherwis in her thought at the same time than as she hope by carolin not live in the same hous with her brother she might occasion spend a morn with her without ani danger of see him the gardin stay a week at longbourn and what with the phillips the lucas and the offic there was not a day without it engag mrs bennet had so care provid for the entertain of her brother and sister that they did not onc sit down to a famili dinner when the engag was for home some of the offic alway made part of itof which offic mr wickham was sure to be one and on these occas mrs gardin render suspici by elizabeth warm commend narrowli observ them both without suppos them from what she saw to be veri serious in love their prefer of each other was plain enough to make her a littl uneasi and she resolv to speak to elizabeth on the subject befor she left hertfordshir and repres to her the imprud of encourag such an attach to mrs gardin wickham had one mean of afford pleasur unconnect with his general power about ten or a dozen year ago befor her marriag she had spent a consider time in that veri part of derbyshir to which he belong they had therefor mani acquaint in common and though wickham had been littl there sinc the death of darci father it was yet in his power to give her fresher intellig of her former friend than she had been in the way of procur mrs gardin had seen pemberley and known the late mr darci by charact perfect well here consequ was an inexhaust subject of discours in compar her recollect of pemberley with the minut descript which wickham could give and in bestow her tribut of prais on the charact of it late possessor she was delight both him and herself on be made acquaint with the present mr darci treatment of him she tri to rememb some of that gentleman reput disposit when quit a lad which might agre with it and was confid at last that she recollect have heard mr fitzwilliam darci former spoken of as a veri proud ill natur boy chapter 26 mrs gardin caution to elizabeth was punctual and kind given on the first favour opportun of speak to her alon after honest tell her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensibl a girl lizzi to fall in love mere becaus you are warn against it and therefor i am not afraid of speak open serious i would have you be on your guard do not involv yourself or endeavour to involv him in an affect which the want of fortun would make so veri imprud i have noth to say against him he is a most interest young man and if he had the fortun he ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is you must not let your fanci run away with you you have sens and we all expect you to use it your father would depend on your resolut and good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your father my dear aunt this is be serious inde yes and i hope to engag you to be serious likewis well then you need not be under ani alarm i will take care of myself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it elizabeth you are not serious now i beg your pardon i will tri again at present i am not in love with mr wickham no i certain am not but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeabl man i ever sawand if he becom realli attach to mei believ it will be better that he should not i see the imprud of it oh that abomin mr darci my father opinion of me doe me the greatest honour and i should be miser to forfeit it my father howev is partial to mr wickham in short my dear aunt i should be veri sorri to be the mean of make ani of you unhappi but sinc we see everi day that where there is affect young peopl are seldom withheld by immedi want of fortun from enter into engag with each other how can i promis to be wiser than so mani of my fellow creatur if i am tempt or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist all that i can promis you therefor is not to be in a hurri i will not be in a hurri to believ myself his first object when i am in compani with him i will not be wish in short i will do my best perhap it will be as well if you discourag his come here so veri often at least you should not remind your mother of invit him as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile veri true it will be wise in me to refrain from that but do not imagin that he is alway here so often it is on your account that he has been so frequent invit this week you know my mother idea as to the necess of constant compani for her friend but realli and upon my honour i will tri to do what i think to be the wisest and now i hope you are satisfi her aunt assur her that she was and elizabeth have thank her for the kind of her hint they part a wonder instanc of advic be given on such a point without be resent mr collin return into hertfordshir soon after it had been quit by the gardin and jane but as he took up his abod with the lucas his arriv was no great inconveni to mrs bennet his marriag was now fast approach and she was at length so far resign as to think it inevit and even repeat to say in an ill natur tone that she wish they might be happi thursday was to be the wed day and on wednesday miss luca paid her farewel visit and when she rose to take leav elizabeth asham of her mother ungraci and reluct good wish and sincer affect herself accompani her out of the room as they went downstair togeth charlott said i shall depend on hear from you veri often eliza that you certain shall and i have anoth favour to ask you will you come and see me we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshir i am not like to leav kent for some time promis me therefor to come to hunsford elizabeth could not refus though she foresaw littl pleasur in the visit my father and maria are come to me in march ad charlott and i hope you will consent to be of the parti inde eliza you will be as welcom as either of them the wed took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and everybodi had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspond was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equal unreserv was imposs elizabeth could never address her without feel that all the comfort of intimaci was over and though determin not to slacken as a correspond it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was charlott first letter were receiv with a good deal of eager there could not but be curios to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like ladi catherin and how happi she would dare pronounc herself to be though when the letter were read elizabeth felt that charlott express herself on everi point exact as she might have foreseen she wrote cheer seem surround with comfort and mention noth which she could not prais the hous furnitur neighbourhood and road were all to her tast and ladi catherin behaviour was most friend and oblig it was mr collinss pictur of hunsford and rose ration soften and elizabeth perceiv that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest jane had alreadi written a few line to her sister to announc their safe arriv in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hope it would be in her power to say someth of the bingley her impati for this second letter was as well reward as impati general is jane had been a week in town without either see or hear from carolin she account for it howev by suppos that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accid been lost my aunt she continu is go to morrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportun of call in grosvenor street she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley i did not think carolin in spirit were her word but she was veri glad to see me and reproach me for give her no notic of my come to london i was right therefor my last letter had never reach her i inquir after their brother of cours he was well but so much engag with mr darci that they scarc ever saw him i found that miss darci was expect to dinner i wish i could see her my visit was not long as carolin and mrs hurst were go out i dare say i shall see them soon here elizabeth shook her head over this letter it convinc her that accid onli could discov to mr bingley her sister be in town four week pass away and jane saw noth of him she endeavour to persuad herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley inattent after wait at home everi morn for a fortnight and invent everi even a fresh excus for her the visitor did at last appear but the short of her stay and yet more the alter of her manner would allow jane to deceiv herself no longer the letter which she wrote on this occas to her sister will prove what she felt my dearest lizzi will i am sure be incap of triumph in her better judgement at my expens when i confess myself to have been entir deceiv in miss bingley regard for me but my dear sister though the event has prove you right do not think me obstin if i still assert that consid what her behaviour was my confid was as natur as your suspicion i do not at all comprehend her reason for wish to be intim with me but if the same circumst were to happen again i am sure i should be deceiv again carolin did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receiv in the meantim when she did come it was veri evid that she had no pleasur in it she made a slight formal apolog for not call befor said not a word of wish to see me again and was in everi respect so alter a creatur that when she went away i was perfect resolv to continu the acquaint no longer i piti though i cannot help blame her she was veri wrong in singl me out as she did i can safe say that everi advanc to intimaci began on her side but i piti her becaus she must feel that she has been act wrong and becaus i am veri sure that anxieti for her brother is the caus of it i need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxieti to be quit needless yet if she feel it it will easili account for her behaviour to me and so deserv dear as he is to his sister whatev anxieti she must feel on his behalf is natur and amiabl i cannot but wonder howev at her have ani such fear now becaus if he had at all care about me we must have met long ago he know of my be in town i am certain from someth she said herself and yet it would seem by her manner of talk as if she want to persuad herself that he is realli partial to miss darci i cannot understand it if i were not afraid of judg harsh i should be almost tempt to say that there is a strong appear of duplic in all this but i will endeavour to banish everi pain thought and think onli of what will make me happyyour affect and the invari kind of my dear uncl and aunt let me hear from you veri soon miss bingley said someth of his never return to netherfield again of give up the hous but not with ani certainti we had better not mention it i am extrem glad that you have such pleasant account from our friend at hunsford pray go to see them with sir william and maria i am sure you will be veri comfort thereyour etc this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirit return as she consid that jane would no longer be dupe by the sister at least all expect from the brother was now absolut over she would not even wish for a renew of his attent his charact sunk on everi review of it and as a punish for him as well as a possibl advantag to jane she serious hope he might realli soon marri mr darci sister as by wickham account she would make him abund regret what he had thrown away mrs gardin about this time remind elizabeth of her promis concern that gentleman and requir inform and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give content to her aunt than to herself his appar partial had subsid his attent were over he was the admir of some one els elizabeth was watch enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without materi pain her heart had been but slight touch and her vaniti was satisfi with believ that she would have been his onli choic had fortun permit it the sudden acquisit of ten thousand pound was the most remark charm of the young ladi to whom he was now render himself agreeabl but elizabeth less clear sight perhap in this case than in charlott did not quarrel with him for his wish of independ noth on the contrari could be more natur and while abl to suppos that it cost him a few struggl to relinquish her she was readi to allow it a wise and desir measur for both and could veri sincer wish him happi all this was acknowledg to mrs gardin and after relat the circumst she thus went on i am now convinc my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i realli experienc that pure and elev passion i should at present detest his veri name and wish him all manner of evil but my feel are not onli cordial toward him they are even imparti toward miss king i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwil to think her a veri good sort of girl there can be no love in all this my watch has been effectu and though i certain should be a more interest object to all my acquaint were i distract in love with him i cannot say that i regret my compar insignific import may sometim be purchas too dear kitti and lydia take his defect much more to heart than i do they are young in the way of the world and not yet open to the mortifi convict that handsom young men must have someth to live on as well as the plain chapter 27 with no greater event than these in the longbourn famili and otherwis diversifi by littl beyond the walk to meryton sometim dirti and sometim cold did januari and februari pass away march was to take elizabeth to hunsford she had not at first thought veri serious of go thither but charlott she soon found was depend on the plan and she gradual learn to consid it herself with greater pleasur as well as greater certainti absenc had increas her desir of see charlott again and weaken her disgust of mr collin there was novelti in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanion sister home could not be faultless a littl chang was not unwelcom for it own sake the journey would moreov give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been veri sorri for ani delay everyth howev went on smooth and was final settl accord to charlott first sketch she was to accompani sir william and his second daughter the improv of spend a night in london was ad in time and the plan becam perfect as plan could be the onli pain was in leav her father who would certain miss her and who when it came to the point so littl like her go that he told her to write to him and almost promis to answer her letter the farewel between herself and mr wickham was perfect friend on his side even more his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excit and to deserv his attent the first to listen and to piti the first to be admir and in his manner of bid her adieu wish her everi enjoy remind her of what she was to expect in ladi catherin de bourgh and trust their opinion of hertheir opinion of everybodywould alway coincid there was a solicitud an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincer regard and she part from him convinc that whether marri or singl he must alway be her model of the amiabl and pleas her fellow travel the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeabl sir william luca and his daughter maria a good humour girl but as empti head as himself had noth to say that could be worth hear and were listen to with about as much delight as the rattl of the chais elizabeth love absurd but she had known sir william too long he could tell her noth new of the wonder of his present and knighthood and his civil were worn out like his inform it was a journey of onli twenti four mile and they began it so earli as to be in gracechurch street by noon as they drove to mr gardin door jane was at a draw room window watch their arriv when they enter the passag she was there to welcom them and elizabeth look earnest in her face was pleas to see it health and love as ever on the stair were a troop of littl boy and girl whose eager for their cousin appear would not allow them to wait in the draw room and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevent their come lower all was joy and kind the day pass most pleasant away the morn in bustl and shop and the even at one of the theatr elizabeth then contriv to sit by her aunt their first object was her sister and she was more griev than astonish to hear in repli to her minut inquiri that though jane alway struggl to support her spirit there were period of deject it was reason howev to hope that they would not continu long mrs gardin gave her the particular also of miss bingley visit in gracechurch street and repeat convers occur at differ time between jane and herself which prove that the former had from her heart given up the acquaint mrs gardin then ralli her niec on wickham desert and compliment her on bear it so well but my dear elizabeth she ad what sort of girl is miss king i should be sorri to think our friend mercenari pray my dear aunt what is the differ in matrimoni affair between the mercenari and the prudent motiv where doe discret end and avaric begin last christma you were afraid of his marri me becaus it would be imprud and now becaus he is tri to get a girl with onli ten thousand pound you want to find out that he is mercenari if you will onli tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think she is a veri good kind of girl i believ i know no harm of her but he paid her not the smallest attent till her grandfath death made her mistress of this fortun nowhi should he if it were not allow for him to gain my affect becaus i had no money what occas could there be for make love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equal poor but there seem an indelicaci in direct his attent toward her so soon after this event a man in distress circumst has not time for all those eleg decorum which other peopl may observ if she doe not object to it whi should we her not object doe not justifi him it onli show her be defici in someth herselfsens or feel well cri elizabeth have it as you choos he shall be mercenari and she shall be foolish no lizzi that is what i do not choos i should be sorri you know to think ill of a young man who has live so long in derbyshir oh if that is all i have a veri poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshir and their intim friend who live in hertfordshir are not much better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am go to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeabl qualiti who has neither manner nor sens to recommend him stupid men are the onli one worth know after all take care lizzi that speech savour strong of disappoint befor they were separ by the conclus of the play she had the unexpect happi of an invit to accompani her uncl and aunt in a tour of pleasur which they propos take in the summer we have not determin how far it shall carri us said mrs gardin but perhap to the lake no scheme could have been more agreeabl to elizabeth and her accept of the invit was most readi and grate oh my dear dear aunt she raptur cri what delight what felic you

describ ani particular scene will we begin quarrel about it relat situat let our first effus be less insupport than those of the general of travel chapter 28 everi object in the next day journey was new and interest to elizabeth and her spirit were in a state of enjoy for she had seen her sister look so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant sourc of delight when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford everi eye was in search of the parsonag and everi turn expect to bring it in view the pale of rose park was their boundari on one

everyth declar they were arriv mr collin and charlott appear at the door and the carriag stop at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the hous amidst the nod and smile of the whole parti in a moment they were all out of the chais rejoic at the sight of each other mrs collin welcom her friend with the liveliest pleasur and elizabeth was more and more satisfi with come when she found

went away the whole famili return to their usual employ and elizabeth was thank to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alter for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now pass by him either at work in the garden or in read and write and look out of the window in his own book room which front the road the room in which the ladi sat was backward elizabeth had at first rather wonder that charlott should not prefer the dine parlour for common use it was a better size room and had a more pleasant aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excel reason for what she did for mr collin would undoubt have been much less in his own apart had they sat in one equal live and she gave charlott credit for the arrang from the draw room they could distinguish noth in the lane and were indebt to mr collin for the knowledg of what carriag went along and how often especi miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never fail come to inform them of though it

scold them into harmoni and plenti the entertain of dine at rose was repeat about twice a week and allow for the loss of sir william and there be onli one card tabl in the even everi such entertain was the counterpart of the first their other engag were few as the style of live in the neighbourhood in general was beyond mr collinss reach this howev was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she

instruct on execut and tast elizabeth receiv them with all the forbear of civil and at the request of the gentlemen remain at the instrument till her ladyship carriag was readi to take them all home chapter 32 elizabeth was sit by herself the next morn and write to jane while mrs collin and maria were gone on busi into the villag when she was startl by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor as she had heard no carriag she thought it not unlik to be ladi catherin and under that apprehens was put away her half finish letter that she might escap all impertin question when the door open and to her veri great surpris mr darci and mr darci onli enter the room he seem astonish too on find her alon and apologis for his intrus by let her know that he had understood all the ladi were to be within they then sat down and when her inquiri after rose were made seem in danger of sink into total silenc it was absolut necessari therefor to think of someth and in this emerg recollect when she had seen him last in hertfordshir and feel curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasti departur she observ how veri sudden you all quit netherfield last novemb mr darci it must have been a most agreeabl surpris to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day befor he and his sister were well i hope when you left london perfect so i thank you she found that she was to receiv no other answer and after a short paus ad i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever return to netherfield again i have never heard him say so but it is probabl that he may spend veri littl of his time there in the futur he has mani friend and is at a time of life when friend and engag are continu increas if he mean to be but littl at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entir for then we might possibl get a settl famili there but perhap mr bingley did not take the hous so much for the conveni of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principl i should not be surpris said darci if he were to give it up as soon as ani elig purchas offer elizabeth made no answer she was afraid of talk longer of his friend and have noth els to say was now determin to leav the troubl of find a subject to him he took the hint and soon began with this seem a veri comfort hous ladi catherin i believ did a great deal to it when mr collin first came to hunsford i believ she didand i am sure she could not have bestow her kind on a more grate object mr collin appear to be veri fortun in his choic of a wife yes inde his friend may well rejoic in his have met with one of the veri few sensibl women who would have accept him or have made him happi if they had my friend has an excel understandingthough i am not certain that i consid her marri mr collin as the wisest thing she ever did she seem perfect happi howev and in a prudenti light it is certain a veri good match for her it must be veri agreeabl for her to be settl within so easi a distanc of her own famili and friend an easi distanc do you call it it is near fifti mile and what is fifti mile of good road littl more than half a day journey yes i call it a veri easi distanc i should never have consid the distanc as one of the advantag of the match cri elizabeth i should never have said mrs collin was settl near her famili it is a proof of your own attach to hertfordshir anyth beyond the veri neighbourhood of longbourn i suppos would appear far as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fanci she understood he must be suppos her to be think of jane and netherfield and she blush as she answer i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settl too near her famili the far and the near must be relat and depend on mani vari circumst where there is fortun to make the expens of travel unimport distanc becom no evil but that is not the case here mr and mrs collin have a comfort incom but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuad my friend would not call herself near her famili under less than half the present distanc mr darci drew his chair a littl toward her and said you cannot have a right to such veri strong local attach you cannot have been alway at longbourn elizabeth look surpris the gentleman experienc some chang of feel he drew back his chair took a newspap from the tabl and glanc over it said in a colder voic are you pleas with kent a short dialogu on the subject of the countri ensu on either side calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entranc of charlott and her sister just return from her walk the tete a tete surpris them mr darci relat the mistak which had occas his intrud on miss bennet and after sit a few minut longer without say much to anybodi went away what can be the mean of this said charlott as soon as he was gone my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have call us in this familiar way but when elizabeth told of his silenc it did not seem veri like even to charlott wish to be the case and after various conjectur they could at last onli suppos his visit to proceed from the difficulti of find anyth to do which was the more probabl from the time of year all field sport were over within door there was ladi catherin book and a billiard tabl but gentlemen cannot alway be within door and in the near of the parsonag or the pleasant of the walk to it or of the peopl who live in it the two cousin found a temptat from this period of walk thither almost everi day they call at various time of the morn sometim separ sometim togeth and now and then accompani by their aunt it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came becaus he had pleasur in their societi a persuas which of cours recommend him still more and elizabeth was remind by her own satisfact in be with him as well as by his evid admir of her of her former favourit georg wickham and though in compar them she saw there was less captiv soft in colonel fitzwilliam manner she believ he might have the best inform mind but whi mr darci came so often to the parsonag it was more difficult to understand it could not be for societi as he frequent sat there ten minut togeth without open his lip and when he did speak it seem the effect of necess rather than of choicea sacrific to proprieti not a pleasur to himself he seldom appear realli anim mrs collin knew not what to make of him colonel fitzwilliam occasion laugh at his stupid prove that he was general differ which her own knowledg of him could not have told her and as she would like to have believ this chang the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she set herself serious to work to find it out she watch him whenev they were at rose and whenev he came to hunsford but without much success he certain look at her friend a great deal but the express of that look was disput it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubt whether there were much admir in it and sometim it seem noth but absenc of mind she had onc or twice suggest to elizabeth the possibl of his be partial to her but elizabeth alway laugh at the idea and mrs collin did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of rais expect which might onli end in disappoint for in her opinion it admit not of a doubt that all her friend dislik would vanish if she could suppos him to be in her power in her kind scheme for elizabeth she sometim plan her marri colonel fitzwilliam he was beyond comparison the most pleasant man he certain admir her and his situat in life was most elig but to counterbal these advantag mr darci had consider patronag in the church and his cousin could have none at all chapter 33 more than onc did elizabeth in her rambl within the park unexpect meet mr darci she felt all the pervers of the mischanc that should bring him where no one els was brought and to prevent it ever happen again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourit haunt of her how it could occur a second time therefor was veri odd yet it did and even a third it seem like wil ill natur or a voluntari penanc for on these occas it was not mere a few formal inquiri and an awkward paus and then away but he actual thought it necessari to turn back and walk with her he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the troubl of talk or of listen much but it struck her in the cours of their third rencontr that he was ask some odd unconnect questionsabout her pleasur in be at hunsford her love of solitari walk and her opinion of mr and mrs collinss happi and that in speak of rose and her not perfect understand the hous he seem to expect that whenev she came into kent again she would be stay there too his word seem to impli it could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thought she suppos if he meant anyth he must mean an allus to what might aris in that quarter it distress her a littl and she was quit glad to find herself at the gate in the pale opposit the parsonag she was engag one day as she walk in perus jane last letter and dwell on some passag which prove that jane had not written in spirit when instead of be again surpris by mr darci she saw on look up that colonel fitzwilliam was meet her put away the letter immedi and forc a smile she said i did not know befor that you ever walk this way i have been make the tour of the park he repli as i general do everi year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonag are you go much farther no i should have turn in a moment and accord she did turn and they walk toward the parsonag togeth do you certain leav kent on saturday said she yesif darci doe not put it off again but i am at his dispos he arrang the busi just as he pleas and if not abl to pleas himself in the arrang he has at least pleasur in the great power of choic i do not know anybodi who seem more to enjoy the power of do what he like than mr darci he like to have his own way veri well repli colonel fitzwilliam but so we all do it is onli that he has better mean of have it than mani other becaus he is rich and mani other are poor i speak feel a younger son you know must be inur to self denial and depend in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know veri littl of either now serious what have you ever known of self denial and depend when have you been prevent by want of money from go wherev you chose or procur anyth you had a fanci for these are home questionsand perhap i cannot say that i have experienc mani hardship of that natur but in matter of greater weight i may suffer from want of money younger son cannot marri where they like unless where they like women of fortun which i think they veri often do our habit of expens make us too depend and there are not mani in my rank of life who can afford to marri without some attent to money is this thought elizabeth meant for me and she colour at the idea but recov herself said in a live tone and pray what is the usual price of an earl younger son unless the elder brother is veri sick i suppos you would not ask abov fifti thousand pound he answer her in the same style and the subject drop to interrupt a silenc which might make him fanci her affect with what had pass she soon afterward said i imagin your cousin brought you down with him chiefli for the sake of have someon at his dispos i wonder he doe not marri to secur a last conveni of that kind but perhap his sister doe as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he like with her no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantag which he must divid with me i am join with him in the guardianship of miss darci are you inde and pray what sort of guardian do you make doe your charg give you much troubl young ladi of her age are sometim a littl difficult to manag and if she has the true darci spirit she may like to have her own way as she spoke she observ him look at her earnest and the manner in which he immedi ask her whi she suppos miss darci like to give them ani uneasi convinc her that she had somehow or other got pretti near the truth she direct repli you need not be frighten i never heard ani harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractabl creatur in the world she is a veri great favourit with some ladi of my acquaint mrs hurst and miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know them i know them a littl their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlik manh is a great friend of darci oh yes said elizabeth drili mr darci is uncommon kind to mr bingley and take a prodigi deal of care of him care of him yes i realli believ darci doe take care of him in those point where he most want care from someth that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley veri much indebt to him but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppos that bingley was the person meant it was all conjectur what is it you mean it is a circumst which darci could not wish to be general known becaus if it were to get round to the ladi famili it would be an unpleas thing you may depend upon my not mention it and rememb that i have not much reason for suppos it to be bingley what he told me was mere this that he congratul himself on have late save a friend from the inconveni of a most imprud marriag but without mention name or ani other particular and i onli suspect it to be bingley from believ him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from know them to have been togeth the whole of last summer did mr darci give you reason for this interfer i understood that there were some veri strong object against the ladi and what art did he use to separ them he did not talk to me of his own art said fitzwilliam smile he onli told me what i have now told you elizabeth made no answer and walk on her heart swell with indign after watch her a littl fitzwilliam ask her whi she was so thought i am think of what you have been tell me said she your cousin conduct doe not suit my feel whi was he to be the judg you are rather dispos to call his interfer offici i do not see what right mr darci had to decid on the proprieti of his friend inclin or whi upon his own judgement alon he was to determin and direct in what manner his friend was to be happi but she continu recollect herself as we know none of the particular it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be suppos that there was much affect in the case that is not an unnatur surmis said fitzwilliam but it is a lessen of the honour of my cousin triumph veri sad this was spoken jest but it appear to her so just a pictur of mr darci that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefor abrupt chang the convers talk on indiffer matter until they reach the parsonag there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interrupt of all that she had heard it was not to be suppos that ani other peopl could be meant than those with whom she was connect there could not exist in the world two men over whom mr darci could have such boundless influenc that he had been concern in the measur taken to separ bingley and jane she had never doubt but she had alway attribut to miss bingley the princip design and arrang of them if his own vaniti howev did not mislead him he was the caus his pride and capric were the caus of all that jane had suffer and still continu to suffer he had ruin for a while everi hope of happi for the most affection generous heart in the world and no one could say how last an evil he might have inflict there were some veri strong object against the ladi were colonel fitzwilliam word and those strong object probabl were her have one uncl who was a countri attorney and anoth who was in busi in london to jane herself she exclaim there could be no possibl of object all loveli and good as she isher understand excel her mind improv and her manner captiv neither could anyth be urg against my father who though with some peculiar has abil mr darci himself need not disdain and respect which he will probabl never reach when she thought of her mother her confid gave way a littl but she would not allow that ani object there had materi weight with mr darci whose pride she was convinc would receiv a deeper wound from the want of import in his friend connect than from their want of sens and she was quit decid at last that he had been part govern by this worst kind of pride and part by the wish of retain mr bingley for his sister the agit and tear which the subject occas brought on a headach and it grew so much wors toward the even that ad to her unwilling to see mr darci it determin her not to attend her cousin to rose where they were engag to drink tea mrs collin see that she was realli unwel did not press her to go and as much as possibl prevent her husband from press her but mr collin could not conceal his apprehens of ladi catherin be rather displeas by her stay at home chapter 34 when they were gone elizabeth as if intend to exasper herself as much as possibl against mr darci chose for her employ the examin of all the letter which jane had written to her sinc her be in kent they contain no actual complaint nor was there ani reviv of past occurr or ani communic of present suffer but in all and in almost everi line of each there was a want of that cheer which had been use to characteris her style and which proceed from the seren of a mind at eas with itself and kind dispos toward everyon had been scarc ever cloud elizabeth notic everi sentenc convey the idea of uneasi with an attent which it had hard receiv on the first perus mr darci shame boast of what miseri he had been abl to inflict gave her a keener sens of her sister suffer it was some consol to think that his visit to rose was to end on the day after the nextand a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabl to contribut to the recoveri of her spirit by all that affect could do she could not think of darci leav kent without rememb that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intent at all and agreeabl as he was she did not mean to be unhappi about him while settl this point she was sudden rous by the sound of the door bell and her spirit were a littl flutter by the idea of it be colonel fitzwilliam himself who had onc befor call late in the even and might now come to inquir particular after her but this idea was soon banish and her spirit were veri differ affect when to her utter amaz she saw mr darci walk into the room in an hurri manner he immedi began an inquiri after her health imput his visit to a wish of hear that she were better she answer him with cold civil he sat down for a few moment and then get up walk about the room elizabeth was surpris but said not a word after a silenc of sever minut he came toward her in an agit manner

and he was not more eloqu on the subject of tender than of pride his sens of her inferiorityof it be a degradationof the famili obstacl which had alway oppos to inclin were dwelt on with a warmth which seem due to the consequ he was wound but was veri unlik to recommend his suit in spite of her deepli root dislik she could not be insens to the compliment of such a man affect and though her intent did not vari for an instant she was at first sorri for the pain he was to receiv till rous to resent by his subsequ languag she lost all compass in anger she tri howev to compos herself to answer him with patienc when he should have done he conclud with repres to her the strength of that attach which in spite of all his endeavour he had found imposs to conquer and with express his hope that it would now be reward by her accept of his hand as he said this she could easili see that he had no doubt of a favour answer he spoke of apprehens and anxieti but his counten express real secur such a circumst could onli exasper farther and when he ceas the colour rose into her cheek and she said in such case as this it is i believ the establish mode to express a sens of oblig for the

the estim in which you hold me i thank you for explain it so fulli my fault accord to this calcul are heavi inde but perhap ad he stop in his walk and turn toward her these offens might have been

spare me the concern which i might have felt in refus you had you behav in a more gentlemanlik manner she saw him start at this but he said noth and she continu you could not have made the offer of

best wish for your health and happi and with these word he hastili left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the hous the tumult of her mind was now pain great she knew not how to support herself and from actual weak sat down and cri for half an hour her astonish as she reflect on what had pass was increas by everi review of it that she should receiv an offer of marriag from mr darci that he should have been in love with her for so mani month so much in love as to wish to marri her in spite of all the object which had made him prevent his friend marri her sister and which must appear at least with equal forc in his own casewa almost incred it was gratifi to have inspir unconsci so strong an affect but his pride his abomin pridehi shameless avow of what he had done with respect to janehi unpardon assur in acknowledg though he could not justifi it and the unfeel manner in which he had mention mr wickham his cruelti toward whom he had not attempt to deni soon overcam the piti which the consider of his attach had for a moment excit she continu in veri agit reflect till the sound of ladi catherin carriag made her feel how unequ she was to encount charlott observ and hurri her away to her room chapter 35 elizabeth awok the next morn to the same thought and medit which had at length close her eye she could not yet recov from the surpris of what had happen it was imposs to think of anyth els and total indispos for employ she resolv soon after breakfast to indulg herself in air and exercis she was proceed direct to her favourit walk when the recollect of mr darci sometim come there stop her and instead of enter the park she turn up the lane which led farther from the turnpik road the park pale was still the boundari on one side and she soon pass one of the gate into the ground after walk two or three time along that part of the lane she was tempt by the pleasant of the morn to stop at the gate and look into the park the five week which she had now pass in kent had made a great differ in the countri and everi day was ad to the verdur of the earli tree she was on the point of continu her walk when she caught a glimps of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edg the park he was move that way and fear of it be mr darci she was direct retreat but the person who advanc was now near enough to see her and step forward with eager pronounc her name she had turn away but on hear herself call though in a voic which prove it to be mr darci she move again toward the gate he had by that time reach it also and hold out a letter which she instinct took said with a look of haughti composur i have been walk in the grove some time in the hope of meet you will you do me the honour of read that letter and then with a slight bow turn again into the plantat and was soon out of sight with no expect of pleasur but with the strongest curios elizabeth open the letter and to her still increas wonder perceiv an envelop contain two sheet of letter paper written quit through in a veri close hand the envelop itself was likewis full pursu her way along the lane she then began it it was date from rose at eight oclock in the morn and was as follow be not alarm madam on receiv this letter by the apprehens of it contain ani repetit of those sentiment or renew of those offer which were last night so disgust to you i write without ani intent of pain you or humbl myself by dwell on wish which for the happi of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the format and the perus of this letter must occas should have been spare had not my charact requir it to be written and read you must therefor pardon the freedom with which i demand your attent your feel i know will bestow it unwil but i demand it of your justic two offens of a veri differ natur and by no mean of equal magnitud you last night laid to my charg the first mention was that regardless of the sentiment of either i had detach mr bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defianc of various claim in defianc of honour and human ruin the immedi prosper and blast the prospect of mr wickham wil and wanton to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledg favourit of my father a young man who had scarc ani other depend than on our patronag and who had been brought up to expect it exert would be a deprav to which the separ of two young person whose affect could be the growth of onli a few week could bear no comparison but from the sever of that blame which was last night so liber bestow respect each circumst i shall hope to be in the futur secur when the follow account of my action and their motiv has been read if in the explan of them which is due to myself i am under the necess of relat feel which may be offens to your i can onli say that i am sorri the necess must be obey and further apolog would be absurd i had not been long in hertfordshir befor i saw in common with other that bingley prefer your elder sister to ani other young woman in the countri but it was not till the even of the danc at netherfield that i had ani apprehens of his feel a serious attach i had often seen him in love befor at that ball while i had the honour of danc with you i was first made acquaint by sir william lucass accident inform that bingley attent to your sister had given rise to a general expect of their marriag he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alon could be undecid from that moment i observ my friend behaviour attent and i could then perceiv that his partial for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever wit in him your sister i also watch her look and manner were open cheer and engag as ever but without ani symptom of peculiar regard and i remain convinc from the even scrutini that though she receiv his attent with pleasur she did not invit them by ani particip of sentiment if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in error your superior knowledg of your sister must make the latter probabl if it be so if i have been misl by such error to inflict pain on her your resent has not been unreason but i shall not scrupl to assert that the seren of your sister counten and air was such as might have given the most acut observ a convict that howev amiabl her temper her heart was not like to be easili touch that i was desir of believ her indiffer is certainbut i will ventur to say that my investig and decis are not usual influenc by my hope or fear i did not believ her to be indiffer becaus i wish it i believ it on imparti convict as truli as i wish it in reason my object to the marriag were not mere those which i last night acknowledg to have the utmost forc of passion to put asid in my own case the want of connect could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me but there were other caus of repugn caus which though still exist and exist to an equal degre in both instanc i had myself endeavour to forget becaus they were not immedi befor me these caus must be state though briefli the situat of your mother famili though objection was noth in comparison to that total want of proprieti so frequent so almost uniform betray by herself by your three younger sister and occasion even by your father pardon me it pain me to offend you but amidst your concern for the defect of your nearest relat and your displeasur at this represent of them let it give you consol to consid that to have conduct yourselv so as to avoid ani share of the like censur is prais no less general bestow on you and your elder sister than it is honour to the sens and disposit of both i will onli say farther that from what pass that even my opinion of all parti was confirm and everi induc heighten which could have led me befor to preserv my friend from what i esteem a most unhappi connect he left netherfield for london on the day follow as you i am certain rememb with the design of soon return the part which i act is now to be explain his sister uneasi had been equal excit with my own our coincid of feel was soon discov and alik sensibl that no time was to be lost in detach their brother we short resolv on join him direct in london we accord wentand there i readili engag in the offic of point out to my friend the certain evil of such a choic i describ and enforc them earnest but howev this remonstr might have stagger or delay his determin i do not suppos that it would ultim have prevent the marriag had it not been second by the assur that i hesit not in give of your sister indiffer he had befor believ her to return his affect with sincer if not with equal regard but bingley has great natur modesti with a stronger depend on my judgement than on his own to convinc him therefor that he had deceiv himself was no veri difficult point to persuad him against return into hertfordshir when that convict had been given was scarc the work of a moment i cannot blame myself for have done thus much there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfact it is that i condescend to adopt the measur of art so far as to conceal from him your sister be in town i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignor of it that they might have met without ill consequ is perhap probabl but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguish for him to see her without some danger perhap this conceal this disguis was beneath me it is done howev and it was done for the best on this subject i have noth more to say no other apolog to offer if i have wound your sister feel it was unknow done and though the motiv which govern me may to you veri natur appear insuffici i have not yet learnt to condemn them with respect to that other more weighti accus of have injur mr wickham i can onli refut it by lay befor you the whole of his connect with my famili of what he has particular accus me i am ignor but of the truth of what i shall relat i can summon more than one wit of undoubt verac mr wickham is the son of a veri respect man who had for mani year the manag of all the pemberley estat and whose good conduct in the discharg of his trust natur inclin my father to be of servic to him and on georg wickham who was his godson his kind was therefor liber bestow my father support him at school and afterward at cambridgemost import assist as his own father alway poor from the extravag of his wife would have been unabl to give him a gentleman educ my father was not onli fond of this young man societi whose manner were alway engag he had also the highest opinion of him and hope the church would be his profess intend to provid for him in it as for myself it is mani mani year sinc i first began to think of him in a veri differ manner the vicious propensitiesth want of principl which he was care to guard from the knowledg of his best friend could not escap the observ of a young man of near the same age with himself and who had opportun of see him in unguard moment which mr darci could not have here again i shall give you painto what degre you onli can tell but whatev may be the sentiment which mr wickham has creat a suspicion of their natur shall not prevent me from unfold his real characterit add even anoth motiv my excel father die about five year ago and his attach to mr wickham was to the last so steadi that in his will he particular recommend it to me to promot his advanc in the best manner that his profess might allowand if he took order desir that a valuabl famili live might be his as soon as it becam vacant there was also a legaci of one thousand pound his own father did not long surviv mine and within half a year from these event mr wickham wrote to inform me that have final resolv against take order he hope i should not think it unreason for him to expect some more immedi pecuniari advantag in lieu of the prefer by which he could not be benefit he had some intent he ad of studi law and i must be awar that the interest of one thousand

elizabeth when mr darci gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renew of his offer she had form no expect at all of it content but such as they were it may well be suppos how eager she went through them and what a contrarieti of emot they excit her feel as she read were scarc to be defin with amaz did she first understand that he believ ani apolog to be in his power and steadfast was she persuad that he could have no explan to give which a just sens of shame would not conceal with a strong prejudic against everyth he might say she began his account of what had happen at netherfield she read with an eager which hard left her power of comprehens and from impati of know what the next sentenc might bring was incap of attend to the sens of the one befor her eye his belief of her sister insens she instant resolv to be fals and his account of the real the worst object to the match made her too angri to have ani wish of do him justic he express no regret for what he had done which satisfi her his style was not penit but haughti it was all pride and insol but when this subject was succeed by his account of mr wickhamwhen she read with somewhat clearer attent a relat of

had not befor known it extent agre equal well with his own word so far each recit confirm the other but when she came to the will the differ was great what wickham had said of the live was fresh in her memori and as she recal his veri word it was imposs not to feel that there was gross duplic on one side or the other and for a few moment she flatter herself that her wish did not err but when she read and re read with the closest attent the particular immedi follow of wickham resign all pretens to the live of his receiv in lieu so consider a sum as three thousand pound again was she forc to hesit she put down the letter weigh everi circumst with what she meant to be impartialitydeliber on the probabl of each statementbut with littl success on both side it was onli assert again she read on but everi line prove more clear that the affair which she had believ it imposs that ani contriv could so repres as to render mr darci conduct in it less than infam was capabl of a turn which must make him entir blameless throughout the whole the extravag and general profligaci which he scrupl not to lay at mr wickham charg exceed shock her the more so as she could bring no proof of it injustic she had never heard of him befor his entranc into the shire militia in which he had engag at the persuas of the young man who on meet him accident in town had there renew a slight acquaint of his

wholli banish by the convict that mr darci would never have hazard such a propos if he had not been well assur of his cousin corrobor she perfect rememb everyth that had pass in convers between wickham and herself in their first even at mr phillipss mani of his express were still fresh in her memori she was now struck with the improprieti of such communic to a stranger and wonder it had escap her befor she saw the indelicaci of put himself forward as he had done and the inconsist of his profess with his conduct she rememb that he had boast of have no fear of see mr darcythat mr darci might leav the countri but that he should stand his ground yet he had avoid the netherfield ball the veri next week she rememb also that till the netherfield famili had quit the countri he had told

your profus make me save and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather poor wickham there is such an express of good in his counten such an open and gentl in his manner there certain was some great mismanag in the educ of those two young men one has got all the good and the other all the appear of it i never thought mr darci so defici in the appear of it as you use to do and yet i meant to be uncommon clever in take so decid a dislik to him without ani reason it is such a spur to one genius such an open for wit to have a dislik of that kind one may be continu abus without say anyth just but one cannot alway be laugh at a man without now and then stumbl on someth witti lizzi when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do

knew i had oh how i want you how unfortun that you should have use such veri strong express in speak of wickham to mr darci for now they do appear wholli undeserv certain but the misfortun of speak with bitter is a most natur consequ of the prejudic i had been encourag there is one point on which i want your advic i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaint in general understand wickham charact miss bennet paus a littl and then repli sure there can be no occas for expos him so dread what is your opinion that it ought not to be attempt mr darci has not authoris me to make his communic public on the contrari everi particular relat to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possibl to myself and if i endeavour to undec peopl as to the rest of his conduct who will believ me the general prejudic against mr darci is so violent that it would be the death of half the good peopl in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiabl light i am not equal to it wickham will soon be gone and therefor it will not signifi to anyon here what he realli is some time henc it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupid in not know it befor at present i will say noth about it you are quit right to have his error made public might ruin him for ever he is now perhap sorri for what he has done and anxious to re establish a charact we must not make him desper the tumult of elizabeth mind was allay by this convers she had got rid of two of the secret which had weigh on her for a fortnight and was certain of a will listen in jane whenev she might wish to talk again of either but there was still someth lurk behind of which prudenc forbad the disclosur she dare not relat the other half of mr darci letter nor explain to her sister how sincer she had been valu by her friend here was knowledg in which no one could partak and she was sensibl that noth less than a perfect understand between the parti could justifi her in throw off this last encumbr of mysteri and then said she if that veri improb event should ever take place i shall mere be abl to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeabl manner himself the liberti of communic cannot be mine till it has lost all it valu she was now on be settl at home at leisur to observ the real state of her sister spirit jane was not happi she still cherish a veri tender affect for bingley have never even fanci herself in love befor her regard had all the warmth of first attach and from her age and disposit greater steadi than most first attach often boast and so fervent did she valu his remembr and prefer him to everi other man that all her good sens and all her attent to the feel of her friend were requisit to check the indulg of those regret which must have been injuri to her own health and their tranquil well lizzi said mrs bennet one day what is your opinion now of this sad busi of jane for my part i am determin never to speak of it again to anybodi i told my sister phillip so the other day but i cannot find out that jane saw anyth of him in london well he is a veri undeserv young manand i do not suppos there the least chanc in the world of her ever get him now there is no talk of his come to netherfield again in the summer and i have inquir of everybodi too who is like to know i do not believ he will ever live at netherfield ani more oh well it is just as he choos nobodi want him to come though i shall alway say he use my daughter extrem ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorri for what he has done but as elizabeth could not receiv comfort from ani such expect she made no answer well lizzi continu her mother soon afterward and so the collins live veri comfort do they well well i onli hope it will last and what sort of tabl do they keep charlott is an excel manag i dare say if she is half as sharp as her mother she is save enough there is noth extravag in their housekeep i dare say no noth at all a great deal of good manag depend upon it yes yes they will take care not to outrun their incom they will never be distress for money well much good may it do them and so i suppos they often talk of have longbourn when your father is dead they look upon it as quit their own i dare say whenev that happen it was a subject which they could not mention befor me no it would have been strang if they had but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselv well if they can be easi with an estat that is not law their own so much the better i should be asham of have one that was onli entail on me chapter 41 the first week of their return was soon gone the second began it was the last of the regiment stay in meryton and all the young ladi in the neighbourhood were droop apac the deject was almost univers the elder miss bennet alon were still abl to eat drink and sleep and pursu the usual cours of their employ veri frequent were they reproach for this insens by kitti and lydia whose own miseri was extrem and who could not comprehend such hard hearted in ani of the famili good heaven what is to becom of us what are we to do would they often exclaim in the bitter of woe how can you be smile so lizzi their affection mother share all their grief she rememb what she had herself endur on a similar occas five and twenti year ago i am sure said she i cri for two day togeth when colonel miller regiment went away i thought i should have broken my heart i am sure i shall break mine said lydia if one could but go to brighton observ mrs bennet oh yesif one could but go to brighton but papa is so disagre a littl sea bath would set me up forev and my aunt phillip is sure it would do me a great deal of good ad kitti such were the kind of lament resound perpetu through longbourn hous elizabeth tri to be divert by them but all sens of pleasur was lost in shame she felt anew the justic of mr darci object and never had she been so much dispos to pardon his interfer in the view of his friend but the gloom of lydia prospect was short clear away for she receiv an invit from mrs forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompani her to brighton this invalu friend was a veri young woman and veri late marri a resembl in good humour and good spirit had recommend her and lydia to each other and out of their three month acquaint they had been intim two the raptur of lydia on this occas her ador of mrs forster the delight of mrs bennet and the mortif of kitti are scarc to be describ wholli inattent to her sister feel lydia flew about the hous in restless ecstasi call for everyon congratul and laugh and talk with more violenc than ever whilst the luckless kitti continu in the parlour repin at her fate in term as unreason as her accent was peevish i cannot see whi mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she though i am not her particular friend i have just as much right to be ask as she has and more too for i am two year older in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reason and jane to make her resign as for elizabeth herself this invit was so far from excit in her the same feel as in her mother and lydia that she consid it as the death warrant of all possibl of common sens for the latter and detest as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secret advis her father not to let her go she repres to him all the improprieti of lydia general behaviour the littl advantag she could deriv from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster and the probabl of her be yet more imprud with such a companion at brighton where the temptat must be greater than at home he heard her attent and then said lydia will never be easi until she has expos herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so littl expens or inconveni to her famili as under the present circumst if you were awar said elizabeth of the veri great disadvantag to us all which must aris from the public notic of lydia unguard and imprud mannernay which has alreadi arisen from it i am sure you would judg differ in the affair alreadi arisen repeat mr bennet what has she frighten away some of your lover poor littl lizzi but do not be cast down such squeamish youth as cannot bear to be connect with a littl absurd are not worth a regret come let me see the list of piti fellow who have been kept aloof by lydia folli inde you are mistaken i have no such injuri to resent it is not of particular but of general evil which i am now complain our import our respect in the world must be affect by the wild volatil the assur and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia charact excus me for i must speak plain if you my dear father will not take the troubl of check her exuber spirit and of teach her that her present pursuit are not to be the busi of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amend her charact will be fix and she will at sixteen be the most determin flirt that ever made herself or her famili ridicul a flirt too in the worst and meanest degre of flirtat without ani attract beyond youth and a toler person and from the ignor and empti of her mind wholli unabl to ward off ani portion of that univers contempt which her rage for admir will excit in this danger kitti also is comprehend she will follow wherev lydia lead vain ignor idl and absolut uncontrol oh my dear father can you suppos it possibl that they will not be censur and despis wherev they are known and that their sister will not be often involv in the disgrac mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affection take her hand said in repli do not make yourself uneasi my love wherev you and jane are known you must be respect and valu and you will not appear to less advantag for have a coupl ofor i may say threeveri silli sister we shall have no peac at longbourn if lydia doe not go to brighton let her go then colonel forster is a sensibl man and will keep her out of ani real mischief and she is luckili too poor to be an object of prey to anybodi at brighton she will be of less import even as a common flirt than she has been here the offic will find women better worth their notic let us hope therefor that her be there may teach her her own insignific at ani rate she cannot grow mani degre wors without authoris us to lock her up for the rest of her life with this answer elizabeth was forc to be content but her own opinion continu the same and she left him disappoint and sorri it was not in her natur howev to increas her vexat by dwell on them she was confid of have perform her duti and to fret over unavoid evil or augment them by anxieti was no part of her disposit had lydia and her mother known the substanc of her confer with her father their indign would hard have found express in their unit volubl in lydia imagin a visit to brighton compris everi possibl of earth happi she saw with the creativ eye of fanci the street of that gay bath place cover with offic she saw herself the object of attent to ten and to score of them at present unknown she saw all the glori of the campit tent stretch forth in beauteous uniform of line crowd with the young and the gay and dazzl with scarlet and to complet the view she saw herself seat beneath a tent tender flirt with at least six offic at onc had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospect and such realiti as these what would have been her sensat they could have been understood onli by her mother who might have felt near the same lydia go to brighton was all that consol her for her melancholi convict of her husband never intend to go there himself but they were entir ignor of what had pass and their raptur continu with littl intermiss to the veri day of lydia leav home elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time have been frequent in compani with him sinc her return agit was pretti well over the agit of formal partial entir so she had even learnt to detect in the veri gentl which had first delight her an affect and a same to disgust and weari in his present behaviour to herself moreov she had a fresh sourc of displeasur for the inclin he soon testifi of renew those intent which had mark the earli part of their acquaint could onli serv after what had sinc pass to provok her she lost all concern for him in find herself thus select as the object of such idl and frivol gallantri and while she steadili repress it could not but feel the reproof contain in his believ that howev long and for whatev caus his attent had been withdrawn her vaniti would be gratifi and her prefer secur at ani time by their renew on the veri last day of the regiment remain at meryton he dine with other of the offic at longbourn and so littl was elizabeth dispos to part from him in good humour that on his make some inquiri as to the manner in which her time had pass at hunsford she mention colonel fitzwilliam and mr darci have both spent three week at rose and ask him if he was acquaint with the former he look surpris displeas alarm but with a moment recollect and a return smile repli that he had former seen him often and after observ that he was a veri gentlemanlik man ask her how she had like him her answer was warm in his favour with an air of indiffer he soon afterward ad how long did you say he was at rose near three week and you saw him frequent yes almost everi day his manner are veri differ from his cousin yes veri differ but i think mr darci improv upon acquaint inde cri mr wickham with a look which did not escap her and pray may i ask but check himself he ad in a gayer tone is it in address that he improv has he deign to add aught of civil to his ordinari stylefor i dare not hope he continu in a lower and more serious tone that he is improv in essenti oh no said elizabeth in essenti i believ he is veri much what he ever was while she spoke wickham look as if scarc know whether to rejoic over her word or to distrust their mean there was a someth in her counten which made him listen with an apprehens and anxious attent while she ad when i said that he improv on acquaint i did not mean that his mind or his manner were in a state of improv but that from know him better his disposit was better understood wickham alarm now appear in a heighten complexion and agit look for a few minut he was silent till shake off his embarrass he turn to her again and said in the gentlest of accent you who so well know my feel toward mr darci will readili comprehend how sincer i must rejoic that he is wise enough to assum even the appear of what is right his pride in that direct may be of servic if not to himself to mani other for it must onli deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffer by i onli fear that the sort of cautious to which you i imagin have been allud is mere adopt on his visit to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgement he stand much in awe his fear of her has alway oper i know when they were togeth and a good deal is to be imput to his wish of forward the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has veri much at heart elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answer onli by a slight inclin of the head she saw that he want to engag her on the old subject of his grievanc and she was in no humour to indulg him the rest of the even pass with the appear on his side of usual cheer but with no further attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they part at last with mutual civil and possibl a mutual desir of never meet again when the parti broke up lydia return with mrs forster to meryton from whenc they were to set out earli the next morn the separ between her and her famili was rather noisi than pathet kitti was the onli one who shed tear but she did weep from vexat and envi mrs bennet was diffus in her good wish for the felic of her daughter and impress in her injunct that she should not miss the opportun of enjoy herself as much as possibleadvic which there was everi reason to believ would be well attend to and in the clamor happi of lydia herself in bid farewel the more gentl adieus of her sister were utter without be heard chapter 42 had elizabeth opinion been all drawn from her own famili she could not have form a veri pleas opinion of conjug felic or domest comfort her father captiv by youth and beauti and that appear of good humour which youth and beauti general give had marri a woman whose weak understand and illiber mind had veri earli in their marriag put an end to all real affect for her respect esteem and confid had vanish for ever and all his view of domest happi were overthrown but mr bennet was not of a disposit to seek comfort for the disappoint which his own imprud had brought on in ani of those pleasur which too often consol the unfortun for their folli or their vice he was fond of the countri and of book and from these tast had arisen his princip enjoy to his wife he was veri littl otherwis indebt than as her ignor and folli had contribut to his amus this is not the sort of happi which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other power of entertain are want the true philosoph will deriv benefit from such as are given elizabeth howev had never been blind to the improprieti of her father behaviour as a husband she had alway seen it with pain but respect his abil and grate for his affection treatment of herself she endeavour to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thought that continu breach of conjug oblig and decorum which in expos his wife to the contempt of her own children was so high reprehens but she had never felt so strong as now the disadvantag which must attend the children of so unsuit a marriag nor ever been so fulli awar of the evil aris from so ill judg a direct of talent talent which right use might at least have preserv the respect of his daughter even if incap of enlarg the mind of his wife when elizabeth had rejoic over wickham departur she found littl other caus for satisfact in the loss of the regiment their parti abroad were less vari than befor and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repin at the dull of everyth around them threw a real gloom over their domest circl and though kitti might in time regain her natur degre of sens sinc the disturb of her brain were remov her other sister from whose disposit greater evil might be apprehend was like to be harden in all her folli and assur by a situat of such doubl danger as a water place and a camp upon the whole therefor she found what has been sometim found befor that an event to which she had been look with impati desir did not in take place bring all the satisfact she had promis herself it was consequ necessari to name some other period for the commenc of actual felicityto have some other point on which her wish and hope might be fix and by again enjoy the pleasur of anticip consol herself for the present and prepar for anoth disappoint her tour to the lake was now the object of her happiest thought it was her best consol for all the uncomfort hour which the discontented of her mother and kitti made inevit and could she have includ jane in the scheme everi part of it would have been perfect but it is fortun thought she that i have someth to wish for were the whole arrang complet my disappoint would be certain but here by carri with me one ceaseless sourc of regret in my sister absenc i may reason hope to have all my expect of pleasur realis a scheme of which everi part promis delight can never be success and general disappoint is onli ward off by the defenc of some littl peculiar vexat when lydia went away she promis to write veri often and veri minut to her mother and kitti but her letter were alway long expect and alway veri short those to her mother contain littl els than that they were just return from the librari where such and such offic had attend them and where she had seen such beauti ornament as made her quit wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have describ more fulli but was oblig to leav off in a violent hurri as mrs forster call her and they were go off to the

for such attent from such a quarter than by suppos a partial for their niec while these newli born notion were pass in their head the perturb of elizabeth feel was at everi moment increas she was quit amaz at her own discomposur but amongst other caus of disquiet she dread lest the partial of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than common anxious to pleas she natur suspect that everi power of pleas would fail her she retreat from the window fear of be seen and as she walk up and down the room endeavour to compos herself saw such look of inquir surpris in her uncl and

her be at lambton she had heard that miss darci was exceed proud but the observ of a veri few minut convinc her that she was onli exceed shi she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyl miss darci was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though littl more than sixteen her figur was form and her appear woman and grace she was less handsom than her brother but there was sens and good humour in her face and her manner were perfect unassum and gentl elizabeth who had expect to find in her as acut and unembarrass an observ as ever mr darci had been was much reliev by discern such differ feel they had not long been togeth befor mr darci told her that bingley was also come to wait on her and she had bare time to express her satisfact and prepar for such a visitor when bingley quick step was heard on the stair and in a moment he enter the room all elizabeth anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt ani it could hard have stood it ground against the unaffect cordial with which he express himself on see her again he inquir in a friend though general way after her famili and look and spoke with the same good humour eas that he had ever done to mr and mrs gardin he was scarc a less interest personag than to herself they had long wish to see him the whole parti befor them inde excit a live attent the suspicion which had just arisen of mr darci and their niec direct their observ toward each with an earnest though guard inquiri and they soon drew from those inquiri the full convict that one of them at least knew what it was to love of the ladi sensat they remain a littl in doubt but that the gentleman was overflow with admir was evid enough elizabeth on her side had much to do she want to ascertain the feel of each of her visitor she want to compos her own and to make herself agreeabl to all and in the latter object where she fear most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavour to give pleasur were prepossess in her favour bingley was readi georgiana was eager and darci determin to be pleas in see bingley her thought natur flew to her sister and oh how ardent did she long to know whether ani of his were direct in a like manner sometim she could fanci that he talk less than on former occas and onc or twice pleas herself with the notion that as he look at her he was tri to trace a resembl but though this might be imaginari she could not be deceiv as to his behaviour to miss darci who had been set up as a rival to jane no look appear on either side that spoke particular regard noth occur between them that could justifi the hope of his sister on this point she was soon satisfi and two or three littl circumst occur ere they part which in her anxious interpret denot a

someth of real regret that it was a veri long time sinc he had had the pleasur of see her and befor she could repli he ad it is abov eight month we have not met sinc the 26th of novemb when we were all danc togeth at netherfield elizabeth was pleas to find his memori so exact and he afterward took occas to ask her when unattend to by ani of the rest whether all her sister were at longbourn there was not much in the question nor in the preced remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them mean it was not often that she could turn her eye on mr darci himself but whenev she did catch a glimps she saw an express of general complais and in all that he said she heard an accent so remov from hauteur or disdain of his companion as convinc her that the improv of manner which she had yesterday wit howev temporari it exist might prove had at least outliv one day when she saw him thus seek the acquaint and court the good opinion of peopl with whom ani intercours a few month ago would have been a disgracewhen she saw him thus civil not onli to herself but to the veri relat whom he had open disdain and recollect their last live scene in hunsford parsonageth differ the chang was so great and struck so forcibl on her mind that she could hard restrain her astonish from be visibl never even in the compani of his dear friend at netherfield or his dignifi relat at rose had she seen him so desir to pleas so free from self consequ or unbend reserv as now when no import could result from the success of his endeavour and when even the acquaint of those to whom his attent were address would draw down the ridicul and censur of the ladi both of netherfield and rose their visitor stay with them abov half an hour and when they aros to depart mr darci call on his sister to join him in express their wish of see mr and mrs gardin and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley befor they left the countri miss darci though with a diffid which mark her littl in the habit of give invit readili obey mrs gardin look at her niec desir of know how she whom the invit most concern felt dispos as to it accept but elizabeth had turn away her head presum howev that this studi avoid spoke

all this into a wish of hear her speak of her sister was pleas and on this account as well as some other found herself when their visitor left them capabl of consid the last half hour with some satisfact though while it was pass the enjoy of it had been littl eager to be alon and fear of inquiri or hint from her uncl and aunt she stay with them onli long enough to hear their favour opinion

than they had befor ani idea of it was evid that he was veri much in love with her they saw much to interest but noth to justifi inquiri of mr darci it was now a matter of anxieti to think well and as far as their acquaint reach there was no fault to find they could not be untouch by his polit and had they drawn his charact from their own feel and his servant report without ani refer to ani other account the circl in hertfordshir to which he was known would not have recogn it for mr darci there was now an interest howev in believ the housekeep and they soon becam sensibl that the author of a

that it might add someth to his live concern for the welfar of his friend elizabeth collect behaviour howev soon quiet his emot and as miss bingley vex and disappoint dare not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recov in time though not enough to be abl to speak ani more her brother whose eye she fear to meet scarc recollect her interest in the affair and the veri circumst which had

how are they even to be discov i have not the smallest hope it is everi way horribl darci shook his head in silent acquiesc when my eye were open to his real characteroh had i known what i ought what i dare to do but i knew noti was afraid of do too much wretch wretch mistak darci made no answer he seem scarc to hear her and was walk up and down the room in earnest medit his brow contract his air gloomi elizabeth soon observ and instant understood it her power was sink everyth must sink under such a proof of famili weak such an assur of the deepest disgrac she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his self conquest brought noth consolatori to her bosom afford no palliat of her distress it was on the contrari exact calcul to make her understand her own wish and never had she so honest felt that she could have love him as now when all love must be vain but self though it would intrud could not engross her lydiath humili the miseri she was bring on them all soon swallow up everi privat care and cover her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to everyth els and after a paus of sever minut was onli recal to a sens of her situat by the voic of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compass spoke likewis restraint said i am afraid you have been long desir my absenc nor have i anyth to plead in excus of my stay but real though unavail concern would to heaven that anyth could be either said or done on my part that might offer consol to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wish which may seem purpos to ask for your thank this unfortun affair will i fear prevent my sister have the pleasur of see you at pemberley to day oh yes be so kind as to apologis for us to miss darci say that urgent busi call us home immedi conceal the unhappi truth as long as it is possibl i know it cannot be long he readili assur her of his secreci again express his sorrow for her distress wish it a happier conclus than there was at present reason to hope and leav his compliment for her relat with onli one serious part look went away as he quit the room elizabeth felt how improb it was that they should ever see each other again on such term of cordial as had mark their sever meet in derbyshir and as she threw a retrospect glanc over the whole of their acquaint so full of contradict and varieti sigh at the pervers of those feel which would now have promot it continu and would former have rejoic in it termin if gratitud and esteem are good foundat of affect elizabeth chang of sentiment will be neither improb nor faulti but if otherwiseif regard spring from such sourc is unreason or unnatur in comparison of what is so often describ as aris on a first interview with it object and even befor two word have been exchang noth can be said in her defenc except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partial for wickham and that it ill success might perhap authoris her to seek the other less interest mode of attach be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this earli exampl of what lydia infami must produc found addit anguish as she reflect on that wretch busi never sinc read jane second letter had she entertain a hope of wickham mean to marri her no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expect surpris was the least of her feel on this develop while the content of the first letter remain in her mind she was all surpriseal astonish that wickham should marri a girl whom it was imposs he could marri for money and how lydia could ever have attach him had appear incomprehens but now it was all too natur for such an attach as this she might have suffici charm and though she did not suppos lydia to be deliber engag in an elop without the intent of marriag she had no difficulti in believ that neither her virtu nor her understand would preserv her from fall an easi prey she had never perceiv while the regiment was in hertfordshir that lydia had ani partial for him but she was convinc that lydia want onli encourag to attach herself to anybodi sometim one offic sometim anoth had been her favourit as their attent rais them in her opinion her affect had continu been fluctuat but never without an object the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulg toward such a girloh how acut did she now feel it she was wild to be at hometo hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the care that must now fall wholli upon her in a famili so derang a father absent a mother incap of exert and requir constant attend and though almost persuad that noth could be done for lydia her uncl interfer seem of the utmost import and till he enter the room her impati was sever mr and mrs gardin had hurri back in alarm suppos by the servant account that their niec was taken sudden ill but satisfi them instant on that head she eager communic the caus of their summon read the two letter aloud and dwell on the postscript of the last with trembl energi though lydia had never been a favourit with them mr and mrs gardin could not but be deepli afflict not lydia onli but all were concern in it and after the first exclam of surpris and horror mr gardin promis everi assist in his power elizabeth though expect no less thank him with tear of gratitud and all three be actuat by one spirit everyth relat to their journey was speedili settl they were to be off as soon as possibl but what is to be done about pemberley cri mrs gardin john told us mr darci was here when you sent for us was it so yes and i told him we should not be abl to keep our engag that is all settl what is all settl repeat the other as she ran into her room to prepar and are they upon such term as for her to disclos the real truth oh that i knew how it was but wish were vain or at least could onli serv to amus her in the hurri and confus of the follow hour had elizabeth been at leisur to be idl she would have remain certain that all employ was imposs to one so wretch as herself but she had her share of busi as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were note to be written to all their friend at lambton with fals excus for their sudden departur an hour howev saw the whole complet and mr gardin meanwhil have settl his account at the inn noth remain to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the miseri of the morn found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have suppos seat in the carriag and on the road to longbourn chapter 47 i have been think it over again elizabeth said her uncl as they drove from the town and realli upon serious consider i am much more inclin than i was to judg as your eldest sister doe on the matter it appear to me so veri unlik that ani young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no mean unprotect or friendless and who was actual stay in his colonel famili that i am strong inclin to hope the best could he expect that her friend would not step forward could he expect to be notic again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptat is not adequ to the risk do you realli think so cri elizabeth brighten up for a moment upon my word said mrs gardin i begin to be of your uncl opinion it is realli too great a violat of decenc honour and interest for him to be guilti of i cannot think so veri ill of wickham can you yourself lizzi so wholli give him up as to believ him capabl of it not perhap of neglect his own interest but of everi other neglect i can believ him capabl if inde it should be so but i dare not hope it whi should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case in the first place repli mr gardin there is no absolut proof that they are not gone to scotland oh but their remov from the chais into a hackney coach is such a presumpt and besid no trace of them were to be found on the barnet road well thensuppos them to be in london they may be there though for the purpos of conceal for no more except purpos it is not like that money should be veri abund on either side and it might strike them that they could be more econom though less expediti marri in london than in scotland but whi all this secreci whi ani fear of detect whi must their marriag be privat oh no nothi is not like his most particular friend you see by jane account was persuad of his never intend to marri her wickham will never marri a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claim has lydiawhat attract has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego everi chanc of benefit himself by marri well as to what restraint the apprehens of disgrac in the corp might throw on a dishonour elop with her i am not abl to judg for i know noth of the effect that such a step might produc but as to your other object i am afraid it will hard hold good lydia has no brother to step forward and he might imagin from my father behaviour from his indol and the littl attent he has ever seem to give to what was go forward in his famili that he would do as littl and think as littl about it as ani father could do in such a matter but can you think that lydia is so lost to everyth but love of him as to consent to live with him on ani term other than marriag it doe seem and it is most shock inde repli elizabeth with tear in her eye that a sister sens of decenc and virtu in such a point should admit of doubt but realli i know not what to say perhap i am not do her justic but she is veri young she has never been taught to think on serious subject and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonthsh has been given up to noth but amus and vaniti she has been allow to dispos of her time in the most idl and frivol manner and to adopt ani opinion that came in her way sinc the shire were first quarter in meryton noth but love flirtat and offic have been in her head she has been do everyth in her power by think and talk on the subject to give greaterwhat shall i call it suscept to her feel which are natur live enough and we all know that wickham has everi charm of person and address that can captiv a woman but you see that jane said her aunt doe not think so veri ill of wickham as to believ him capabl of the attempt of whom doe jane ever think ill and who is there whatev might be their former conduct that she would think capabl of such an attempt till it were prove against them but jane know as well as i do what wickham realli is we both know that he has been proflig in everi sens of the word that he has neither integr nor honour that he is as fals and deceit as he is insinu and do you realli know all this cri mrs gardin whose curios as to the mode of her intellig was all aliv i do inde repli elizabeth colour i told you the other day of his infam behaviour to mr darci and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behav with such forbear and liber toward him and there are other circumst which i am not at libertywhich it is not worth while to relat but his lie about the whole pemberley famili are endless from what he said of miss darci i was thorough prepar to see a proud reserv disagre girl yet he knew to the contrari himself he must know that she was as amiabl and unpretend as we have found her but doe lydia know noth of this can she be ignor of what you and jane seem so well to understand oh yesthat that is the worst of all till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr darci and his relat colonel fitzwilliam i was ignor of the truth myself and when i return home the shire was to leav meryton in a week or fortnight time as that was the case neither jane to whom i relat the whole nor i thought it necessari to make our knowledg public for of what use could it appar be to ani one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it was settl that lydia should go with mrs forster the necess of open her eye to his charact never occur to me that she could be in ani danger from the decept never enter my head that such a consequ as this could ensu you may easili believ was far enough from my thought when they all remov to brighton therefor you had no reason i suppos to believ them fond of each other not the slightest i can rememb no symptom of affect on either side and had anyth of the kind been percept you must be awar that our is not a famili on which it could be thrown away when first he enter the corp she was readi enough to admir him but so we all were everi girl in or near meryton was out of her sens about him for the first two month but he never distinguish her by ani particular attent and consequ after a moder period of extravag and wild admir her fanci for him gave way and other of the regiment who treat her with more distinct again becam her favourit it may be easili believ that howev littl of novelti could be ad to their fear hope and conjectur on this interest subject by it repeat discuss no other could detain them from it long dure the whole of the journey from elizabeth thought it was never absent fix there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interv of eas or forget they travel as expediti as possibl and sleep one night on the road reach longbourn by dinner time the next day it was a comfort to elizabeth to consid that jane could not have been weari by long expect the littl gardin attract by the sight of a chais were stand on the step of the hous as they enter the paddock and when the carriag drove up to the door the joy surpris that light up their face and display itself over their whole bodi in a varieti of caper and frisk was the first pleas earnest of their welcom elizabeth jump out and after give each of them a hasti kiss hurri into the vestibul where jane who came run down from her mother apart immedi met her elizabeth as she affection embrac her whilst tear fill the eye of both lost not a moment in ask whether anyth had been heard of the fugit not yet repli jane but now that my dear uncl is come i hope everyth will be well is my father in town yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word and have you heard from him often we have heard onli twice he wrote me a few line on wednesday to say that he had arriv in safeti and to give me his direct which i particular beg him to do he mere ad that he should not write again till he had someth of import to mention and my motherhow is she how are you all my mother is toler well i trust though her spirit are great shaken she is up stair and will have great satisfact in see you all she doe not yet leav her dress room mari and kitti thank heaven are quit well but youhow are you cri elizabeth you look pale how much you must have gone through her sister howev assur her of her be perfect well and their convers which had been pass while mr and mrs gardin were engag with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole parti jane ran to her uncl and aunt and welcom and thank them both with altern smile and tear when they were all in the draw room the question which elizabeth had alreadi ask were of cours repeat by the other and they soon found that jane had no intellig to give the sanguin hope of good howev which the benevol of her heart suggest had not yet desert her she still expect that it would all end well and that everi morn would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceed and perhap announc their marriag mrs bennet to whose apart they all repair after a few minut convers togeth receiv them exact as might be expect with tear and lament of regret invect against the villain conduct of wickham and complaint of her own suffer and ill usag blame everybodi but the person to whose ill judg indulg the error of her daughter must princip be owe if i had been abl said she to carri my point in go to brighton with all my famili this would not have happen but poor dear lydia had nobodi to take care of her whi did the forster ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well look after i alway thought they were veri unfit to have the charg of her but i was overrul as i alway am poor dear child and now here mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherev he meet him and then he will be kill and what is to becom of us all the collins will turn us out befor he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do they all exclaim against such terrif idea and mr gardin after general assur of his affect for her and all her famili told her that he meant to be in london the veri next day and would assist mr bennet in everi endeavour for recov lydia do not give way to useless alarm ad he though it is right to be prepar for the worst there is no occas to look on it as certain it is not quit a week sinc they left brighton in a few day more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not marri and have no design of marri do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult togeth as to what is to be done oh my dear brother repli mrs bennet that is exact what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherev they may be and if they are not marri alreadi make them marri and as for wed cloth do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she choos to buy them after they are marri and abov all keep mr bennet from fight tell him what a dread state i am in that i am fright out of my witsand have such trembl such flutter all over mesuch spasm in my side and pain in my head and such beat at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to give ani direct about her cloth till she has seen me for she doe not know which are the best warehous oh brother how kind you are i know you will contriv it all but mr gardin though he assur her again of his earnest endeavour in the caus could not avoid recommend moder to her as well in her hope as her fear and after talk with her in this manner till dinner was on the tabl they all left her to vent all her feel on the housekeep who attend in the absenc of her daughter though her brother and sister were persuad that there was no real occas for such a seclus from the famili they did not attempt to oppos it for they knew that she had not prudenc enough to hold her tongu befor the servant while they wait at tabl and judg it better that one onli of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fear and solicitud on the subject in the dine room they were soon join by mari and kitti who had been too busili engag in their separ apart to make their appear befor one came from her book and the other from her toilett the face of both howev were toler calm and no chang was visibl in either except that the loss of her favourit sister or the anger which she had herself incur in this busi had given more of fret than usual to the accent of kitti as for mari she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a counten of grave reflect soon after they were seat at tabl this is a most unfortun affair and will probabl be much talk of but we must stem the tide of malic and pour into the wound bosom of each other the balm of sister consol then perceiv in elizabeth no inclin of repli she ad unhappi as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this use lesson that loss of virtu in a femal is irretriev that one fals step involv her in endless ruin that her reput is no less brittl than it is beauti and that she cannot be too much guard in her behaviour toward the undeserv of the other sex elizabeth lift up her eye in amaz but was too much oppress to make ani repli mari howev continu to consol herself with such kind of moral extract from the evil befor them in the afternoon the two elder miss bennet were abl to be for half an hour by themselv and elizabeth instant avail herself of the opportun of make ani inquiri which jane was equal eager to satisfi after join in general lament over the dread sequel of this event which elizabeth consid as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholli imposs the former continu the subject by say but tell me all and everyth about it which i have not alreadi heard give me further particular what did colonel forster say had they no apprehens of anyth befor the elop took place they must have seen them togeth for ever colonel forster did own that he had often suspect some partial especi on lydia side but noth to give him ani alarm i am so griev for him his behaviour was attent and kind to the utmost he was come to us in order to assur us of his concern befor he had ani idea of their not be gone to scotland when that apprehens first got abroad it hasten his journey and was denni convinc that wickham would not marri did he know of their intend to go off had colonel forster seen denni himself yes but when question by him denni deni know anyth of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it he did not repeat his persuas of their not marryingand from that i am inclin to hope he might have been misunderstood befor and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertain a doubt i suppos of their be realli marri how was it possibl that such an idea should enter our brain i felt a littl uneasya littl fear of my sister happi with him in marriag becaus i knew that his conduct had not been alway quit right my father and mother knew noth of that they onli felt how imprud a match it must be kitti then own with a veri natur triumph on know more than the rest of us that in lydia last letter she had prepar her for such a step she had known it seem of their be in love with each other mani week but not befor they went to brighton no i believ not and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself doe he know his real charact i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he former did he believ him to be imprud and extravag and sinc this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton great in debt but i hope this may be fals oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have

epsom the place where they last chang hors see the postilion and tri if anyth could be made out from them his princip object must be to discov the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come with a fare from london and as he thought that the circumst of a gentleman and ladi remov from one carriag into anoth might be remark he meant to make inquiri at clapham if he could anyhow discov at what hous the coachman had befor set down his fare he determin to make inquiri there and hope it might not be imposs to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of ani other design that he had form but he was in such a hurri to be gone and his spirit so great discompos that i had difficulti in find out even so much as this chapter 48 the whole parti were in hope of a letter from mr bennet the next morn but the post came in without bring a singl line from him his famili knew him to be on all common occas a most neglig and dilatori correspond but at such a time they had hope for exert they were forc to conclud that he had no pleas intellig to send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain mr gardin had wait onli for the letter befor he set off when he was gone they were certain at least of receiv constant inform of what was go on and their uncl promis at part to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consol of his sister who consid it as the onli secur for her husband not be kill in a duel mrs gardin and the children were to remain in hertfordshir a few day longer as the former thought her presenc might be servic to her niec she share in their attend on mrs bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hour of freedom their other aunt also visit them frequent and alway as she said with the design of cheer and hearten them upthough as she never came without report some fresh instanc of wickham extravag or irregular she seldom went away without leav them more dispirit than she found them all meryton seem strive to blacken the man who but three month befor had been almost an angel of light he was declar to be in debt to everi tradesman in the place and his intrigu all honour with the titl of seduct had been extend into everi tradesman famili everybodi declar that he was the wickedest young man in the world and everybodi began to find out that they had alway distrust the appear of his good elizabeth though she did not credit abov half of what was said believ enough to make her former assur of her sister ruin more certain and even jane who believ still less of it becam almost hopeless more especi as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never befor entir despair of they must in all probabl have gain some news of them mr gardin left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife receiv a letter from him it told them that on his arriv he had immedi found out his brother and persuad him to come to gracechurch street that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham befor his arriv but without gain ani satisfactori inform and that he was now determin to inquir at all the princip hotel in town as mr bennet thought it possibl they might have gone to one of them on their first come to london befor they procur lodg mr gardin himself did not expect ani success from this measur but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursu it he ad that mr bennet seem wholli disinclin at present to leav london and promis to write again veri soon there was also a postscript to this effect i have written to colonel forster to desir him to find out if possibl from some of the young man intim in the regiment whether wickham has ani relat or connect who would be like to know in what part of town he has now conceal himself if there were anyon that one could appli to with a probabl of gain such a clue as that it might be of essenti consequ at present we have noth to guid us colonel forster will i dare say do everyth in his power to satisfi us on this head but on second thought perhap lizzi could tell us what relat he has now live better than ani other person elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whenc this defer to her author proceed but it was not in her power to give ani inform of so satisfactori a natur as the compliment deserv she had never heard of his have had ani relat except a father and mother both of whom had been dead mani year it was possibl howev that some of his companion in the shire might be abl to give more inform and though she was not veri sanguin in expect it the applic was a someth to look forward to everi day at longbourn was now a day of anxieti but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expect the arriv of letter was the grand object of everi morn impati through letter whatev of good or bad was to be told would be communic and everi succeed day was expect to bring some news of import but befor they heard again from mr gardin a letter arriv for their father from a differ quarter from mr collin which as jane had receiv direct to open all that came for him in his absenc she accord read and elizabeth who knew what curios his letter alway were look over her and read it likewis it was as follow my dear sir i feel myself call upon by our relationship and my situat in life to condol with you on the grievous afflict you are now suffer under of which we were yesterday inform by a letter from hertfordshir be assur my dear sir that mrs collin and myself sincer sympathis with you and all your respect famili in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind becaus proceed from a caus which no time can remov no argument shall be want on my part that can allevi so sever a misfortuneor that may comfort you under a circumst that must be of all other the most afflict to a parent mind the death of your daughter would have been a bless in comparison of this and it is the more to be lament becaus there is reason to suppos as my dear charlott inform me that this licenti of behaviour in your daughter has proceed from a faulti degre of indulg though at the same time for the consol of yourself and mrs bennet i am inclin to think that her own disposit must be natur bad or she could not be guilti of such an enorm at so earli an age howsoev that may be you are grievous to be piti in which opinion i am not onli join by mrs collin but likewis by ladi catherin and her daughter to whom i have relat the affair they agre with me in apprehend that this fals step in one daughter will be injuri to the fortun of all the other for who as ladi catherin herself condescend say will connect themselv with such a famili and this consider lead me moreov to reflect with augment satisfact on a certain event of last novemb for had it been otherwis i must have been involv in all your sorrow and disgrac let me then advis you dear sir to consol yourself as much as possibl to throw off your unworthi child from your affect for ever and leav her to reap the fruit of her own heinous offens i am dear sir etc etc mr gardin did not write again till he had receiv an answer from colonel forster and then he had noth of a pleasant natur to send it was not known that wickham had a singl relationship with whom he kept up ani connect and it was certain that he had no near one live his former acquaint had been numer but sinc he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on term of particular friendship with ani of them there was no one therefor who could be point out as like to give ani news of him and in the wretch state of his own financ there was a veri power motiv for secreci in addit to his fear of discoveri by lydia relat for it had just transpir that he had left game debt behind him to a veri consider amount colonel forster believ that more than a thousand pound would be necessari to clear his expens at brighton he owe a good deal in town but his debt of honour were still more formid mr gardin did not attempt to conceal these particular from the longbourn famili jane heard them with horror a gamest she cri this is wholli unexpect i had not an idea of it mr gardin ad in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the follow day which was saturday render spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavour he had yield to his brother in law entreati that he would return to his famili and leav it to him to do whatev occas might suggest to be advis for continu their pursuit when mrs bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfact as her children expect consid what her anxieti for his life had been befor what is he come home and without poor lydia she cri sure he will not leav london befor he has found them who is to fight wickham and make him marri her if he come away as mrs gardin began to wish to be at home it was settl that she and the children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet came from it the coach therefor took them the first stage of their journey and brought it master back to longbourn mrs gardin went away in all the perplex about elizabeth and her derbyshir friend that had attend her from that part of the world his name had never been voluntarili mention befor them by her niec and the kind of half expect which mrs gardin had form of their be follow by a letter from him had end in noth elizabeth had receiv none sinc her return that could come from pemberley the present unhappi state of the famili render ani other excus for the low of her spirit unnecessari noth therefor could be fair conjectur from that though elizabeth who was by this time toler well acquaint with her own feel was perfect awar that had she known noth of darci she could have born the dread of lydia infami somewhat better it would have spare her she thought one sleepless night out of two when mr bennet arriv he had all the appear of his usual philosoph composur he said as littl as he had ever been in the habit of say made no mention of the busi that had taken him away and it was some time befor his daughter had courag to speak of it it was not till the afternoon when he had join them at tea that elizabeth ventur to introduc the subject and then on her briefli express her sorrow for what he must have endur he repli say noth of that who should suffer but myself it has been my own do and i ought to feel it you must not be too sever upon yourself repli elizabeth you may well warn me against such an evil human natur is so prone to fall into it no lizzi let me onc in my life feel how much i have been to blame i am not afraid

small sum could not do all this no said her father wickham a fool if he take her with a farth less than ten thousand pound i should be sorri to think so ill of him in the veri begin of our relationship ten thousand pound heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be repaid mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continu silent till they reach the hous their father then went on to the librari to write and the girl walk into the breakfast room and they are realli to be marri cri elizabeth as soon as they were by themselv how strang this is and for this we are to be thank that they should marri small as is their chanc of happi and wretch as is his charact we are forc to rejoic oh lydia i comfort myself with think repli jane that he certain would not marri lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncl has done someth toward clear him i cannot believ that ten thousand pound or anyth like it has been advanc he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pound if he were ever abl to learn what wickham debt have been said elizabeth and how much is settl on his side on our sister we shall exact know what mr gardin has done for them becaus wickham has not sixpenc of his own the kind of my uncl and aunt can never be requit their take her home and afford her their person protect and counten is such a

we take my uncl letter to read to her take whatev you like and get away elizabeth took the letter from his write tabl and they went up stair togeth mari and kitti were both with mrs bennet one communic would therefor do for all after a slight prepar for good news the letter was read aloud mrs bennet could hard contain herself as soon as jane had read mr gardin hope of lydia be soon marri her joy burst forth and everi follow sentenc ad to it exuber she was now in an irrit as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgeti from alarm and vexat to know that her daughter would be marri

all under for we must attribut this happi conclus she ad in a great measur to his kind we are persuad that he has pledg himself to assist mr wickham with money well cri her mother it is all veri right

and cambric and would short have dictat some veri plenti order had not jane though with some difficulti persuad her to wait till her father was at leisur to be consult one day delay she observ would be of small import and her mother was too happi to be quit so obstin as usual other scheme too came into her head i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dress and tell the good good news to my sister philip and as i come back i can call on ladi luca and mrs long kitti run down and order the carriag an air would do me a great deal of good i am sure girl can i do anyth for you in meryton oh here come hill my dear hill have you heard the good news miss lydia is go to be marri and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merri at her wed mrs hill began instant to express her joy elizabeth receiv her congratul amongst the rest and then sick of this folli took refug in her own room that she might think with freedom poor lydia situat must at best be bad enough but that it was no wors she had need to be thank she felt it so and though in look forward neither ration happi nor world prosper could be just expect for her sister in look back to what they had fear onli two hour ago she felt all the advantag of what they had gain chapter 50 mr bennet had veri often wish befor this period of his life that instead of spend his whole incom he had laid by an annual sum for the better provis of his children and of his wife if she surviv him he now wish it more than ever had he done his duti in that respect lydia need not have been indebt to her uncl for whatev of honour or credit could now be purchas for her the satisfact of prevail on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rest in it proper place he was serious concern that a caus of so littl advantag to anyon should be forward at the sole expens of his brother in law and he was determin if possibl to find out the extent of his assist and to discharg the oblig as soon as he could when first mr bennet had marri economi was held to be perfect useless for of cours they were to have a son the son was to join in cut off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that mean be provid for five daughter success enter the world but yet the son was to come and mrs bennet for mani year after lydia birth had been certain that he would this event had at last been despair of but it was then too late to be save mrs bennet had no turn for economi and her husband love of independ had alon prevent their exceed their incom five thousand pound was settl by marriag articl on mrs bennet and the children but in what proport it should be divid amongst the latter depend on the will of the parent this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settl and mr bennet could have no hesit in acced to the propos befor him in term of grate acknowledg for the kind of his brother though express most concis he then deliv on paper his perfect approb of all that was done and his willing to fulfil the engag that had been made for him he had never befor suppos that could wickham be prevail on to marri his daughter it would be done with so littl inconveni to himself as by the present arrang he would scarc be ten pound a year the loser by the hundr that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allow and the continu present in money which pass to her through her mother hand lydia expens had been veri littl within that sum that it would be done with such trifl exert on his side too was anoth veri welcom surpris for his wish at present was to have as littl troubl in the busi as possibl when the first transport of rage which had produc his activ in seek her were over he natur return to all his former indol his letter was soon dispatch for though dilatori in undertak busi he was quick in it execut he beg to know further particular of what he was indebt to his brother but was too angri with lydia to send ani messag to her the good news spread quick through the hous and with proportion speed through the neighbourhood it was born in the latter with decent philosophi to be sure it would have been more for the advantag of convers had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest altern been seclud from the world in some distant farmhous but there was much to be talk of in marri her and the good natur wish for her well do which had proceed befor from all the spite old ladi in meryton lost but a littl of their spirit in this chang of circumst becaus with such an husband her miseri was consid certain it was a fortnight sinc mrs bennet had been downstair but on this happi day she again took her seat at the head of her tabl and in spirit oppress high no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph the marriag of a daughter which had been the first object of her wish sinc jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplish and her thought and her word ran wholli on those attend of eleg nuptial fine muslin new carriag and servant she was busili search through the neighbourhood for a proper situat for her daughter and without know or consid what their incom might be reject mani as defici in size and import hay park might do said she if the gould could quit itor the great hous at stoke if the draw room were larger but ashworth is too far off i could not bear to have her ten mile from me and as for pulvi lodg the attic are dread her husband allow her to talk on without interrupt while the servant remain but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs bennet befor you take ani or all of these hous for your son and daughter let us come to a right understand into one hous in this neighbourhood they shall never have admitt i will not encourag the impud of either by receiv them at longbourn a long disput follow this declar but mr bennet was firm it soon led to anoth and mrs bennet found with amaz and horror that her husband would not advanc a guinea to buy cloth for his daughter he protest that she should receiv from him no mark of affect whatev on the occas mrs bennet could hard comprehend it that his anger could be carri to such a point of inconceiv resent as to refus his daughter a privileg without which her marriag would scarc seem valid exceed all she could believ possibl she was more aliv to the disgrac which her want of new cloth must reflect on her daughter nuptial than to ani sens of shame at her elop and live with wickham a fortnight befor they took place elizabeth was now most heartili sorri that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make mr darci acquaint with their fear for her sister for sinc her marriag would so short give the proper termin to the elop they might hope to conceal it unfavour begin from all those who were not immedi on the spot she had no fear of it spread farther through his mean there were few peopl on whose secreci she would have more confid depend but at the same time there was no one whose knowledg of a sister frailti would have mortifi her so muchnot howev from ani fear of disadvantag from it individu to herself for at ani rate there seem a gulf impass between them had lydia marriag been conclud on the most honour term it was not to be suppos that mr darci would connect himself with a famili where to everi other object would now be ad an allianc and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so just scorn from such a connect she could not wonder that he would shrink the wish of procur her regard which she had assur herself of his feel in derbyshir could not in ration expect surviv such a blow as this she was humbl she was griev she repent though she hard knew of what she becam jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefit by it she want to hear of him when there seem the least chanc of gain intellig she was convinc that she could have been happi with him when it was no longer like they should meet what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the propos which she had proud spurn onli four month ago would now have been most glad and grate receiv he was as generous she doubt not as the most generous of his sex but while he was mortal there must be a triumph she began now to comprehend that he was exact the man who in disposit and talent would most suit her his understand and temper though unlik her own would have answer all her wish it was an union that must have been to the advantag of both by her eas and liveli his mind might have been soften his manner improv and from his judgement inform and knowledg of the world she must have receiv benefit of greater import but no such happi marriag could now teach the admir multitud what connubi felic realli was an union of a differ tendenc and preclud the possibl of the other was soon to be form in their famili how wickham and lydia were to be support in toler independ she could not imagin but how littl of perman happi could belong to a coupl who were onli brought togeth becaus their passion were stronger than their virtu she could easili conjectur mr gardin soon wrote again to his brother to mr bennet acknowledg he briefli repli with assur of his eager to promot the welfar of ani of his famili and conclud with entreati that the subject might never be mention to him again the princip purport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolv on quit the militia it was great my wish that he should do so he ad as soon as his marriag was fix on and i think you will agre with me in consid the remov from

heard them pass through the hall to the dine parlour she then join them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parad walk up to her mother right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah jane i

your way of get husband their visitor were not to remain abov ten day with them mr wickham had receiv his commiss befor he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight no one but mrs bennet regret that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visit about with her daughter and have veri frequent parti at home these parti were accept to all to avoid a famili circl was even more desir to such as did think than such as did not wickham affect for lydia was just what elizabeth had expect to find it not equal to lydia for him she had scarc need her present observ to be satisfi from the reason of thing that their elop had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wonder whi without violent care for her he chose to elop with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was render necessari by distress of circumst and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportun of have a companion lydia was exceed fond of him he was her dear wickham on everi occas no one was to be put in competit with him he did everi thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more bird on the first of septemb than ani bodi els in the countri one morn soon after their arriv as she was sit with her two elder sister she said to elizabeth lizzi i never gave you an account of my wed i believ you were not by when i told mamma and the other all about it are not you curious to hear how it was manag no realli repli elizabeth i think there cannot be too littl said on the subject la you are so strang but i must tell you how it went off we were marri you know at st clement becaus wickham lodg were in that parish and it was settl that we should all be there by eleven oclock my uncl and aunt and i were to go togeth and the other were to meet us at the church well monday morn came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that someth would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quit distract and there was my aunt all the time i was dress preach and talk away just as if she was read a sermon howev i did not hear abov one word in ten for i was think you may suppos of my dear wickham i long to know whether he would be marri in his blue coat well and so we breakfast at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncl and aunt were horrid unpleas all the time i was with them if youll believ me i did not onc put my foot out of door though i was there a fortnight not one parti or scheme or anyth to be sure london was rather thin but howev the littl theatr was open well and so just as the carriag came to the door my uncl was call away upon busi to that horrid man mr stone and then you know when onc they get togeth there is no end of it well i was so frighten i did not know what to do for my uncl was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be marri all day but luckili he came back again in ten minut time and then we all set out howev i recollect afterward that if he had been prevent go the wed need not be put off for mr darci might have done as well mr darci repeat elizabeth in utter amaz oh yesh was to come there with wickham you know but gracious me i quit forgot i ought not to have said a word about it i promis them so faith what will wickham say it was to be such a secret if it was to be secret said jane say not anoth word on the subject you may depend upon my seek no further oh certain said elizabeth though burn with curios we will ask you no question thank you said lydia for if you did i should certain tell you all and then wickham would be angri on such encourag to ask elizabeth was forc to put it out of her power by run away but to live in ignor on such a point was imposs or at least it was imposs not to tri for inform mr darci had been at her sister wed it was exact a scene and exact among peopl where he had appar least to do and least temptat to go conjectur as to the mean of it rapid and wild hurri into her brain but she was satisfi with none those that best pleas her as place his conduct in the noblest light seem most improb she could not bear such suspens and hastili seiz a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explan of what lydia had dropt if it were compat with the secreci which had been intend you may readili comprehend she ad what my curios must be to know how a person unconnect with ani of us and compar speak a stranger to our famili should have been amongst you at such a time pray write instant and let me understand itunless it is for veri cogent reason to remain in the secreci which lydia seem to think necessari and then i must endeavour to be satisfi with ignor not that i shall though she ad to herself as she finish the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honour manner i shall certain be reduc to trick and stratagem to find it out jane delic sens of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privat of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of ittil it appear whether her inquiri would receiv ani satisfact she had rather be without a confidant chapter 52 elizabeth had the satisfact of receiv an answer to her letter as soon as she possibl could she was no sooner in possess of it than hurri into the littl cops where she was least like to be interrupt she sat down on one of the bench and prepar to be happi for the length of the letter convinc her that it did not contain a denial gracechurch street sept 6 my dear niec i have just receiv your letter and shall devot this whole morn to answer it as i forese that a littl write will not compris what i have to tell you i must confess myself surpris by your applic i did not expect it from you dont think me angri howev for i onli mean to let you know that i had not imagin such inquiri to be necessari on your side if you do not choos to understand me forgiv my impertin your uncl is as much surpris as i amand noth but the belief of your be a parti concern would have allow him to act as he has done but if you are realli innoc and ignor i must be more explicit on the veri day of my come home from longbourn your uncl had a most unexpect visitor mr darci call and was shut up with him sever hour it was all over befor i arriv so my curios was not so dread rack as your seem to have been he came to tell mr gardin that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were and that he had seen and talk with them both wickham repeat lydia onc from what i can collect he left derbyshir onli one day after ourselv and came to town with the resolut of hunt for them the motiv profess was his convict of it be owe to himself that wickham worthless had not been so well known as to make it imposs for ani young woman of charact to love or confid in him he generous imput the whole to his mistaken pride and confess that he had befor thought it beneath him to lay his privat action open to the world his charact was to speak for itself he call it therefor his duti to step forward and endeavour to remedi an evil which had been brought on by himself if he had anoth motiv i am sure it would never disgrac him he had been some day in town befor he was abl to discov them but he had someth to direct his search which was more than we had and the conscious of this was anoth reason for his resolv to follow us there is a ladi it seem a mrs young who was some time ago gover to miss darci and was dismiss from her charg on some caus of disapprob though he did not say what she then took a larg hous in edward street and has sinc maintain herself by let lodg this mrs young was he knew intim acquaint with wickham and he went to her for intellig of him as soon as he got to town but it was two or three day befor he could get from her what he want she would not betray her trust i suppos without briberi and corrupt for she realli did know where her friend was to be found wickham inde had gone to her on their first arriv in london and had she been abl to receiv them into her hous they would have taken up their abod with her at length howev our kind friend procur the wish for direct they were in street he saw wickham and afterward insist on see lydia his first object with her he acknowledg had been to persuad her to quit her present disgrac situat and return to her friend as soon as they could be prevail on to receiv her offer his assist as far as it would go but he found lydia absolut resolv on remain where she was she care for none of her friend she want no help of his she would not hear of leav wickham she was sure they should be marri some time or other and it did not much signifi when sinc such were her feel it onli remain he thought to secur and expedit a marriag which in his veri first convers with wickham he easili learnt had never been his design he confess himself oblig to leav the regiment on account of some debt of honour which were veri press and scrupl not to lay all the ill consequ of lydia flight on her own folli alon he meant to resign his commiss immedi and as to his futur situat he could conjectur veri littl about it he must go somewher but he did not know where and he knew he should have noth to live on mr darci ask him whi he had not marri your sister at onc though mr bennet was not imagin to be veri rich he would have been abl to do someth for him and his situat must have been benefit by marriag but he found in repli to this question that wickham still cherish the hope of more effectu make his fortun by marriag in some other countri under such circumst howev he was not like to be proof against the temptat of immedi relief they met sever time for there was much to be discuss wickham of cours want more than he could get but at length was reduc to be reason everi thing be settl between them mr darci next step was to make your uncl acquaint with it and he first call in gracechurch street the even befor i came home but mr gardin could not be seen and mr darci found on further inquiri that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morn he did not judg your father to be a person whom he could so proper consult as your uncl and therefor readili postpon see him till after the departur of the former he did not leav his name and till the next day it was onli known that a gentleman had call on busi on saturday he came again your father was gone your uncl at home and as i said befor they had a great deal of talk togeth they met again on sunday and then i saw him too it was not all settl befor monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn but our visitor was veri obstin i fanci lizzi that obstinaci is the real defect of his charact after all he has been accus of mani fault at differ time but this is the true one noth was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thank therefor say noth about it your uncl would most readili have settl the whole they battl it togeth for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or ladi concern in it deserv but at last your uncl was forc to yield and instead of be allow to be of use to his niec was forc to put up with onli have the probabl credit of it which went sore against the grain and i realli believ your letter this morn gave him great pleasur becaus it requir an explan that would rob him of his borrow feather and give the prais where it was due but lizzi this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most you know pretti well i suppos what has been done for the young peopl his debt are to be paid amount i believ to consider more than a thousand pound anoth thousand in addit to her own settl upon her and his commiss purchas the reason whi all this was to be done by him alon was such as i have given abov it was owe to him to his reserv and want of proper consider that wickham charact had been so misunderstood and consequ that he had been receiv and notic as he was perhap there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserv or anybodi reserv can be answer for the event but in spite of all this fine talk my dear lizzi you may rest perfect assur that your uncl would never have yield if we had not given him credit for anoth interest in the affair when all this was resolv on he return again to his friend who were still stay at pemberley but it was agre that he should be in london onc more when the wed took place and all money matter were then to receiv the last finish i believ i have now told you everi thing it is a relat which you tell me is to give you great surpris i hope at least it will not afford you ani displeasur lydia came to us and wickham had constant admiss to the hous he was exact what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshir but i would not tell you how littl i was satisfi with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceiv by jane letter last wednesday that her conduct on come home was exact of a piec with it and therefor what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain i talk to her repeat in the most serious manner repres to her all the wicked of what she had done and all the unhappi she had brought on her famili if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen i was sometim quit provok but then i recollect my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sake had patienc with her mr darci was punctual in his return and as lydia inform you attend the wed he dine with us the next day and was to leav town again on wednesday or thursday will you be veri angri with me my dear lizzi if i take this opportun of say what i was never bold enough to say befor how much i like him his behaviour to us has in everi respect been as pleas as when we were in derbyshir his understand and opinion all pleas me he want noth but a littl more liveli and that if he marri prudent his wife may teach him i thought him veri slyhe hard ever mention your name but slyness seem the fashion pray forgiv me if i have been veri presum or at least do not punish me so far as to exclud me from p i shall never be quit happi till i have been all round the park a low phaeton with a nice littl pair of poni would be the veri thing but i must write no more the children have been want me this half hour your veri sincer m gardin the content of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirit in which it was difficult to determin whether pleasur or pain bore the greatest share the vagu and unsettl suspicion which uncertainti had produc of what mr darci might have been do to forward her sister match which she had fear to encourag as an exert of good too great to be probabl and at the same time dread to be just from the pain of oblig were prove beyond their greatest extent to be true he had follow them purpos to town he had taken on himself all the troubl and mortif attend on such a research in which supplic had been necessari to a woman whom he must abomin and despis and where he was reduc to meet frequent meet reason with persuad and final bribe the man whom he alway most wish to avoid and whose veri name it was punish to him to pronounc he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem her heart did whisper that he had done it for her but it was a hope short check by other consider and she soon felt that even her vaniti was insuffici when requir to depend on his affect for herfor a woman who had alreadi refus hima abl to overcom a sentiment so natur as abhorr against relationship with wickham brother in law of wickham everi kind of pride must revolt from the connect he had to be sure done much she was asham to think how much but he had given a reason for his interfer which ask no extraordinari stretch of belief it was reason that he should feel he had been wrong he had liber and he had the mean of exercis it and though she would not place herself as his princip induc she could perhap believ that remain partial for her might assist his endeavour in a caus where her peac of mind must be materi concern it was pain exceed pain to know that they were under oblig to a person who could never receiv a return they owe the restor of lydia her charact everi thing to him oh how heartili did she griev over everi ungraci sensat she had ever encourag everi sauci speech she had ever direct toward him for herself she was humbl but she was proud of him proud that in a caus of compass and honour he had been abl to get the better of himself she read over her aunt commend of him again and again it was hard enough but it pleas her she was even sensibl of some pleasur though mix with regret on find how steadfast both she and her uncl had been persuad that affect and confid subsist between mr darci and herself she was rous from her seat and her reflect by some one approach and befor she could strike into anoth path she was overtaken by wickham i am afraid i interrupt your solitari rambl my dear sister said he as he join her you certain do she repli with a smile but it doe not follow that the interrupt must be unwelcom i should be sorri inde if it were we were alway good friend and now we are better true are the other come out i do not know mrs bennet and lydia are go in the carriag to meryton and so my dear sister i find from our uncl and aunt that you have actual seen pemberley she repli in the affirm i almost envi you the pleasur

promis i am veri glad you like her i hope she will turn out well i dare say she will she has got over the most tri age did you go by the villag of kympton i do not recollect that we did i mention it becaus it is the live which i ought to have had a most delight placeexcel parsonag hous it would have suit me in everi respect how should you have like make sermon exceed well i should have consid it as part of my duti and the exert would soon have been noth one ought not to repinebut to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the quiet the retir of such a life would have answer all my idea of happi but it was not to be did you ever hear darci mention the circumst when you were in kent i have heard from author which i thought as good that it was left you condit onli and at the will of the present patron you have yes there was someth in that i told you so from the first you may rememb i did hear too that there was a time when sermon make was not so palat to you as it seem to be at present that you actual declar your resolut of never take order and that the busi had been compromis accord you did and it was not wholli without foundat you may rememb what i told you on that point when first we talk of it they were now almost at the door of the hous for she had walk fast to get rid of him and unwil for her sister sake to provok him she onli said in repli with a good humour smile come mr wickham we are brother and sister you know do not let us quarrel about the past in futur i hope we shall be alway of one mind she held out her hand he kiss it with affection gallantri

with no other view than what was acknowledg but she still thought him partial to jane and she waver as to the greater probabl of his come there with his friend permiss or be bold enough to come without it yet it is hard she sometim thought that this poor man cannot come to a hous which he has legal hire without rais all this specul i will leav him to himself in spite of what her sister declar and realli believ to be her feel in the expect of his arriv elizabeth could easili perceiv that her spirit were affect by it they were more disturb more unequ than she had often seen them the

sourc of uneasi which could not be suspect by jane to whom she had never yet had courag to shew mrs gardin letter or to relat her own chang of sentiment toward him to jane he could be onli a man whose propos she had refus and whose merit she had undervalu but to her own more extens inform he was the person to whom the whole famili were indebt for the first of benefit and whom she regard herself with an interest if not quit so tender at least as reason and just as what jane felt for bingley her astonish at his comingat his come to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarili seek her again was

in again and rest herself she did not choos it said her daughter she would go she is a veri fine look woman and her call here was prodigi civil for she onli came i suppos to tell us the collins were well she is on her road somewher i dare say and so pass through meryton thought she might as well call on you i suppos she had noth particular to say to you lizzi elizabeth was forc to give into a littl falsehood here for to acknowledg the substanc of their convers was imposs chapter 57 the discomposur of spirit which this extraordinari visit threw elizabeth into could not be easili overcom nor could she for mani hour learn to think of it less than incess ladi catherin it appear had actual taken the troubl of this journey from rose for the sole purpos of break off her suppos engag with mr darci it was a ration scheme to be sure but from what the report of their engag could origin elizabeth was at a loss to imagin till she recollect that his be the intim friend of bingley and her be the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expect of one wed made everybodi eager for anoth to suppli the idea she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriag of her sister must bring them more frequent togeth and her neighbour at luca lodg therefor for through their communic with the collins the report she conclud had reach ladi catherin had onli set that down as almost certain and immedi which she had look forward to as possibl at some futur time in revolv ladi catherin express howev she could not help feel some uneasi as to the possibl consequ of her persist in this interfer from what she had said of her resolut to prevent their marriag it occur to elizabeth that she must medit an applic to her nephew and how he might take a similar represent of the evil attach to a connect with her she dare not pronounc she knew not the exact degre of his affect for his aunt or his depend on her judgment but it was natur to suppos that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumer the miseri of a marriag with one whose immedi connect were so unequ to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side with his notion of digniti he would probabl feel that the argument which to elizabeth had appear weak and ridicul contain much good sens and solid reason if he had been waver befor as to what he should do which had often seem like the advic and entreati of so near a relat might settl everi doubt and determin him at onc to be as happi as digniti unblemish could make him in that case he would return no more ladi catherin might see him in her way through town and his engag to bingley of come again to netherfield must give way if therefor an excus for not keep his promis should come to his friend within a few day she ad i shall know how to understand it i shall then give over everi expect everi wish of his constanc if he is satisfi with onli regret me when he might have obtain my affect and hand i shall soon ceas to regret him at all the surpris of the rest of the famili on hear who their visitor had been was veri great but they oblig satisfi it with the same kind of supposit which had appeas mrs bennet curios and elizabeth was spare from much teas on the subject the next morn as she was go downstair she was met by her father who came out of his librari with a letter in his hand lizzi said he i was go to look for you come into my room she follow him thither and her curios to know what he had to tell her was heighten by the supposit of it be in some manner connect with the letter he held it sudden

personag in this land can you possibl guess lizzi who is meant by this this young gentleman is bless in a peculiar way with everi thing the heart of mortal can most desiresplendid properti nobl kindr and extens patronag yet in spite of all these temptat let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evil you may incur by a precipit closur with this gentleman propos which of cours you will be inclin to take immedi advantag of have you ani idea lizzi who this gentleman is but now it come out my motiv for caution you is as follow we have reason to imagin that his aunt ladi catherin de bourgh doe not look on the match with a friend eye mr darci you see is the man now lizzi i think i have surpris you could he or the lucas have pitch on ani man within the circl of our acquaint whose name would have given the lie more effectu to what they relat mr darci who never look at ani woman but to see a blemish and who probabl never look at you in his life it is admir elizabeth tri to join in her father pleasantri but could onli forc one most reluct smile never had his wit been direct in a manner so littl agreeabl to her are you not divert oh yes pray read on after mention the likelihood of this marriag to her ladyship last night she immedi with her usual condescens express what she felt on the occas when it becam appar that on the score of some famili object on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she term so disgrac a match i thought it my duti to give the speediest intellig of this to my cousin that she and her nobl admir may be awar of what they are about and not run hastili into a marriag which has not been proper sanction mr collin moreov add i am truli rejoic that my cousin lydia sad busi has been so well hush up and am onli concern that their live togeth befor the marriag took place should be so general known i must not howev neglect the duti of my station or refrain from declar my amaz at hear that you receiv the young coupl into your hous as soon as they were marri it was an encourag of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should veri strenuous have oppos it you ought certain to forgiv them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their name to be mention in your hear that is his notion of christian forgiv the rest of his letter is onli about his dear charlott situat and his expect of a young oliv branch but lizzi you look as if you did not enjoy it you are not go to be missish i hope and pretend to be affront at an idl report for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbour and laugh at them in our turn oh cri elizabeth i am excess divert but it is so strang yes that is what make it amus had they fix on ani other man it would have been noth but his perfect indiffer and your point dislik make it so delight absurd much as i abomin write i would not give up mr collinss correspond for ani consider nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help give him the prefer even over wickham much as i valu the impud and hypocrisi of my son in law and pray lizzi what said ladi catherin about this report did she call to refus her consent to this question his daughter repli onli with a laugh and as it had been ask without the least suspicion she was not distress by his repeat it elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feel appear what they were not it was necessari to laugh when she would rather have cri her father had most cruelli mortifi her by what he said of mr darci indiffer and she could do noth but wonder at such a want of penetr or fear that perhap instead of his see too littl she might have fanci too much chapter 58 instead of receiv ani such letter of excus from his friend as elizabeth half expect mr bingley to do he was abl to bring darci with him to longbourn befor mani day had pass after ladi catherin visit the gentlemen arriv earli and befor mrs bennet had time to tell him of their have seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentari dread bingley who want to be alon with jane propos their all walk out it was agre to mrs bennet was not in the habit of walk mari could never spare time but the remain five set off togeth bingley and jane howev soon allow the other to outstrip them they lag behind while elizabeth kitti and darci were to entertain each other veri littl was said by either kitti was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secret form a desper resolut and perhap he might be do the same they walk toward the lucas becaus kitti wish to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occas for make it a general concern when kitti left them she went bold on with him alon now was the moment for her resolut to be execut and while her courag was high she immedi said mr darci i am a veri selfish creatur and for

you have ever been inform of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasi i did not think mrs gardin was so littl to be trust you must not blame my aunt lydia thoughtless first betray to me that you had been concern in the matter and of cours i could not rest till i knew the particular let me thank you again and again in the name of all my famili for that generous compass which induc you to take so much troubl and bear so mani mortif for the sake of discov them if you will thank me he repli let it be for yourself alon that the wish of give happi to you might add forc to the other induc which led me on i shall not attempt to deni but your famili owe me noth much as i respect them i believ i thought onli of you elizabeth was too much embarrass to say a word after a short paus her companion ad you are too generous to trifl with me if your feel are still what they were last april tell me so at onc my affect and wish are unchang but one word from you will silenc me on this subject for ever elizabeth feel all the more than common awkward and anxieti of his situat now forc herself to speak and immedi though not veri fluentli gave him to understand that her sentiment had undergon so materi a chang sinc the period to which he allud as to make her receiv with gratitud and pleasur his present assur the happi which this repli produc was such as he had probabl never felt befor and he express himself on the occas as sensibl and as warm as a man violent in love can be suppos to do had elizabeth been abl to encount his eye she might have seen how well the express of heartfelt delight diffus over his face becam him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feel which in prove of what import she was to him made his affect everi moment more valuabl they walk on without know in what direct there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attent to ani other object she soon learnt that they were indebt for their present good understand to the effort of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relat her journey to longbourn it motiv and the substanc of her convers with elizabeth dwell emphat on everi express of the latter which in her ladyship apprehens peculiar denot her pervers and assur in the belief that such a relat must assist her endeavour to obtain that promis from her nephew which she had refus to give but unluckili for her ladyship it effect had been exact contrariwis it taught me to hope said he as i had scarc ever allow myself to hope befor i knew enough of your disposit to be certain that had you been absolut irrevoc decid against me you would have acknowledg it to ladi catherin frank and open elizabeth colour and laugh as she repli yes you know enough of my frank to believ me capabl of that after abus you so abomin to your face i could have no scrupl in abus you to all your relat what did you say of me that i did not deserv for though your accus were ill found form on mistaken premis my behaviour to you at the time had merit the severest reproof it was unpardon i cannot think of it without abhorr we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annex to that even said elizabeth the conduct of neither if strict examin will be irreproach but sinc then we have both i hope improv in civil i cannot be so easili reconcil to myself the recollect of what i then said of my conduct my manner my express dure the whole of it is now and has been mani month inexpress pain to me your reproof so well appli i shall never forget had you behav in a more gentlemanlik manner those were your word you know not you can scarc conceiv how they have tortur methough it was some time i confess befor i was reason enough to allow their justic i was certain veri far from expect them to make so strong an impress i had not the smallest idea of their be ever felt in such a way i can easili believ it you thought me then devoid of everi proper feel i am sure you did the turn of your counten i shall never forget as you said that i could not have address you in ani possibl way that would induc you to accept me oh do not repeat what i then said these recollect will not do at all i assur you that i have long been most heartili asham of it darci mention his letter did it said he did it soon make you think better of me did you on read it give ani credit to it content she explain what it effect on her had been and how gradual all her former prejudic had been remov i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessari i hope you have destroy the letter there was one part especi the open of it which i should dread your have the power of read again i can rememb some express which might just make you hate me the letter shall certain be burnt if you believ it essenti to the preserv of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinion not entir unalter they are not i hope quit so easili chang as that impli when i wrote that letter repli darci i believ myself perfect calm and cool but i am sinc convinc that it was written in a dread bitter of spirit the letter perhap began in bitter but it did not end so the adieu is chariti itself but think no more of the letter the feel of the person who wrote and the person who receiv it are now so wide differ from what they were then that everi unpleas circumst attend it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my philosophi think onli of the past as it remembr give you pleasur i cannot give you credit for ani philosophi of the kind your retrospect must be so total void of reproach that the content aris from them is not of philosophi but what is much better of innoc but with me it is not so pain recollect will intrud which cannot which ought not to be repel i have been a selfish be all my life in practic though not in principl as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principl but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortun an onli son for mani year an onli child i was spoilt by my parent who though good themselv my father particular all that was benevol and amiabl allow encourag almost taught me to be selfish and overbear to care for none beyond my own famili circl to think mean of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think mean of their sens and worth compar with my own such i was from eight to eight and twenti and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard inde at first but most advantag by you i was proper humbl i came to you without a doubt of my recept you show me how insuffici were all my pretens to pleas a woman worthi of be pleas had you then persuad yourself that i should inde i had what will you think of my vaniti i believ you to be wish expect my address my manner must have been in fault but not intent i assur you i never meant to deceiv you but my spirit might often lead me wrong how you must have hate me after that even hate you i was angri perhap at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direct i am almost afraid of ask what you thought of me when we met at pemberley you blame me for come no inde i felt noth but surpris your surpris could not be greater than mine in be notic by you my conscienc told me that i deserv no extraordinari polit and i confess that i did not expect to receiv more than my due my object then repli darci was to show you by everi civil in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hope to obtain your forgiv to lessen your ill opinion by let you see that your reproof had been attend to how soon ani other wish introduc themselv i can hard tell but i believ in about half an hour after i had seen you he then told her of georgiana delight in her acquaint and of her disappoint at it sudden interrupt which natur lead to the caus of that interrupt she soon learnt that his resolut of follow her from derbyshir in quest of her sister had been form befor he quit the inn and that his graviti and thought there had arisen from no other struggl than what such a purpos must comprehend she express her gratitud again but it was too pain a subject to each to be dwelt on farther after walk sever mile in a leisur manner and too busi to know anyth about it they found at last on examin their watch that it was time to be at home what could becom of mr bingley and jane was a wonder which introduc the discuss of their affair darci was delight with their engag his friend had given him the earliest inform of it i must ask whether you were surpris said elizabeth not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen that is to say you had given your permiss i guess as much and though he exclaim at the term she found that it had been pretti much the case on the even befor my go to london said he i made a confess to him which i believ i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occur to make my former interfer in his affair absurd and impertin his surpris was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreov that i believ myself mistaken in suppos as i had done that your sister was indiffer to him and as i could easili perceiv that his attach to her was unab i felt no doubt of their happi togeth elizabeth could not help smile at his easi manner of direct his friend did you speak from your own observ said she when you told him that my sister love him or mere from my inform last spring from the former i had narrowli observ her dure the two visit which i had late made here and i was convinc of her affect and your assur of it i suppos carri immedi convict to him it did bingley is most unaffect modest his diffid had prevent his depend on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his relianc on mine made everi thing easi i was oblig to confess one thing which for a time and not unjust offend him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three month last winter that i had known it and purpos kept it from him he was angri but his anger i am persuad last no longer than he remain in ani doubt of your sister sentiment he has heartili forgiven me now elizabeth long to observ that mr bingley had been a most delight friend so easili guid that his worth was invalu but she check herself she rememb that he had yet to learn to be laugh at and it was rather too earli to begin in anticip the happi of bingley which of cours was to be inferior onli to his own he continu the convers till they reach the hous in the hall they part chapter 59 my dear lizzi where can you have been walk to was a question which elizabeth receiv from jane as soon as she enter their room and from all the other when they sat down to tabl she had onli to say in repli that they had wander about till she was beyond her own knowledg she colour as she spoke but neither that nor anyth els awaken a suspicion of the truth the even pass quiet unmark by anyth extraordinari the acknowledg lover talk and laugh the unacknowledg were silent darci was not of a disposit in which happi overflow in mirth and elizabeth agit and confus rather knew that she was happi than felt herself to be so for besid the immedi embarrass there were other evil befor her she anticip what would be felt in the famili when her situat becam known she was awar that no one like him but jane and even fear that with the other it was a dislik which not all his fortun and consequ might do away at night she open her heart to jane though suspicion was veri far from miss bennet

owe all that i know of it to anoth not to you elizabeth told her the motiv of her secreci she had been unwil to mention bingley and the unsettl state of her own feel had made her equal avoid the name of his friend but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia marriag all was acknowledg and half the night spent in convers good gracious cri mrs bennet as she stood at a window the next morn if that disagre mr darci is not come here again with our dear bingley what can he mean by be so tiresom as to be alway come here i had no notion but he would go a shoot or someth or other and not disturb us with his compani what shall we do with him lizzi you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley way elizabeth could hard help laugh at so conveni a propos yet was realli vex that her mother should be alway give him such an epithet as soon as they enter bingley look at her so express and shook hand with such warmth as left no doubt of his good inform and he soon afterward said aloud mrs bennet have you no more lane hereabout in which lizzi may lose her way again to day i advis mr darci and lizzi and kitti said mrs bennet to walk to oakham mount this morn it

take it sometim doubt whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcom her abhorr of the man but whether she were violent set against the match or violent delight with it it was certain that her manner would be equal ill adapt to do credit to her sens and she could no more bear that mr darci should hear the first raptur of her joy than the first vehem of her disapprob in the even soon after mr bennet withdrew to the librari she saw mr darci rise also and follow him and her agit on see it was extrem she did not fear her father opposit but he was go to be made unhappi and that
