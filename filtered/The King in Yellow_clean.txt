where the lili was rest at the same instant he plung his hand into the basin and drew out the flower there is no danger he explain if you choos the right moment that golden ray is the signal he held the lili toward me and i took it in my hand it had turn to stone to the purest marbl you see he said it is without a flaw what sculptor could reproduc it the marbl was white as snow but in it depth the vein of the lili were ting with palest azur and a faint flush linger deep in it heart dont ask me the reason of that he smile notic my wonder i have no idea whi the vein and heart are tint but they alway are yesterday i tri one of geneviev gold fishther it is the fish look as if sculptur in marbl but if you held it to the light the stone was beauti vein with a faint blue and from somewher within came a rosi light like the tint which slumber in an opal i look into the basin onc more it seem fill with clearest crystal if i should touch it now i demand i dont know he repli but you had better not tri there is one thing im curious about i said and that is where the ray of sunlight came from it look like a sunbeam true enough he said i dont know it alway come when i immers ani live thing perhap he continu smile perhap it is the vital spark of the creatur escap to the sourc from whenc it came i saw he was mock and threaten him with a mahl stick but he onli laugh and chang the subject stay to lunch geneviev will be here direct i saw her go to earli mass i said and she look as fresh and sweet as that lilybefor you destroy it do you think i destroy it said bori grave destroy preserv how can we tell we sat in the corner of a studio near his unfinish group of the fate he lean back on the sofa twirl a sculptor chisel and squint at his work by the way he said i have finish point up that old academ ariadn and i suppos it will have to go to the salon it all i have readi this year but after the success the madonna brought me i feel asham to send a thing like that the madonna an exquisit marbl for which geneviev had sat had been the sensat of last year salon i look at the ariadn it was a magnific piec of technic work but i agre with bori that the world would expect someth better of him than that still it was imposs now to think of finish in time for the salon that splendid terribl group half shroud in the marbl behind me the fate would have to wait we were proud of bori yvain we claim him and he claim us on the strength of his have been born in america although his father was french and his mother was a russian everi one in the beaux art call him bori and yet there were onli two of us whom he address in the same familiar wayjack scott and myself perhap my be in love with geneviev had someth to do with his affect for me not that it had ever been acknowledg between us but after all was settl and she had told me with tear in her eye that it was bori whom she love i went over to his hous and congratul him the perfect cordial of that interview did not deceiv either of us i alway believ although to one at least it was a great comfort i do not think he and geneviev ever spoke of the matter togeth but bori knew geneviev was love the madonna like puriti of her face might have been inspir by the sanctus in gounod mass but i was alway glad when she chang that mood for what we call her april manoeuvr she was often as variabl as an april day in the morn grave dignifi and sweet at noon laugh caprici at even whatev one least expect i prefer her so rather than in that madonna like tranquil which stir the depth of my heart i was dream of geneviev when he spoke again what do you think of my discoveri alec i think it wonder i shall make no use of it you know beyond satisfi my own curios so far as may be and the secret will die with me it would be rather a blow to sculptur would it not we painter lose more than we ever gain by photographi bori nod play with the edg of the chisel this new vicious discoveri would corrupt the world of art no i shall never confid the secret to ani one he said slowli it would be hard to find ani one less inform about such phenomena than myself but of cours i had heard of miner spring so satur with silica that the leav and twig which fell into them were turn to stone after a time i dim comprehend the process how the silica replac the veget matter atom by atom and the result was a duplic of the object in stone this i confess had never interest me great and as for the ancient fossil thus produc they disgust me bori it appear feel curios instead of repugn had investig the subject and had accident stumbl on a solut which attack the immers object with a feroc unheard of in a second did the work of year this was all i could make out of the strang stori he had just been tell me he spoke again after a long silenc i am almost frighten when i think what i have found scientist would go mad over the discoveri it was so simpl too it discov itself when i think of that formula and that new element precipit in metal scale what new element oh i havent thought of name it and i dont believ i ever shall there are enough precious metal now in the world to cut throat over i prick up my ear have you struck gold bori no betterbut see here alec he laugh start up you and i have all we need in this world ah how sinist and covet you look alreadi i laugh too and told him i was devour by the

soft curv of her fair hair as she turn her cheek to bori then she saw me and return my greet she had never befor fail to blow me a kiss from the tip of her white finger and i prompt complain of the omiss she smile and held out her hand which drop almost befor it had touch mine then she said look at bori you must ask alec to stay for luncheon this also was someth new she had alway ask me herself

while my face burn like a live coal and the blood surg in my ear stupefi me with it clamour incap of movement incap of speech i listen to her feverish word in an agoni of shame and sorrow i could not silenc her i could not look at bori then i felt an arm upon my shoulder and bori turn a bloodless face to mine it is not your fault alec dont griev so if she love you but he could not finish and as the doctor step swift into the room sayingah the fever i seiz jack scott and hurri him to the street say bori would rather be alon we cross the street to our own apart and that night see i was go to be ill too he went for the doctor again the last thing i recollect with ani distinct was hear jack say for heaven sake doctor what ail him to wear a face like that and i thought of the king in yellow and the pallid mask i was veri ill for the strain of two year which i had endur sinc that fatal may morn when geneviev murmur i love you but i think i love bori best told on me at last i had never imagin that it could becom more than i could endur outward tranquil i had deceiv myself although the inward battl rage night after night and i lie alon in my room curs myself for rebelli thought unloy to bori and unworthi of geneviev the morn alway brought relief and i return to geneviev and to my dear bori with a heart wash clean by the tempest of the night never in word or deed or thought while with them had i betray my sorrow even to myself the mask of self decept was no longer a mask for me it was a part of me night lift it lay bare the stifl truth below but there was no one to see except myself and when the day broke the mask fell back again of it own accord these thought pass through my troubl mind as i lay sick but they were hopeless entangl with vision of white creatur heavi as stone crawl about in bori basinof the wolf head on the rug foam and snap at geneviev who lay smile besid it i thought too of the king in yellow wrap in the fantast colour of his tatter mantl and that bitter cri of cassilda not upon us oh king not upon us feverish i struggl to put it from me but i saw the lake of hali thin and blank without a rippl or wind to stir it and i saw the tower of carcosa behind the moon aldebaran the hyad alar hastur glide through the cloud rift which flutter and flap as they pass like the scollop tatter of the king in yellow among all these one sane thought persist it never waver no matter what els was go on in my disord mind that my chief reason for exist was to meet some requir of bori and geneviev what this oblig was it natur was never clear sometim it seem to be protect sometim support through a great crisi whatev it seem to be for the time it weight rest onli on me and i was never so ill or so weak that i did not respond with my whole soul there were alway crowd of face about me most strang but a few i recogn bori among them afterward they told me that this could not have been but i know that onc at least he bent over me it was onli a touch a faint echo of his voic then the cloud settl back on my sens and i lost him but he did stand there and bend over me onc at least at last one morn i awok to find the sunlight fall across my bed and jack scott read besid me i had not strength enough to speak aloud neither could i think much less rememb but i could smile feebli as jack eye met mine and when he jump up and ask eager if i want anyth i could whisper yesbori jack move to the head of my bed and lean down to arrang my pillow i did not see his face but he answer heartili you must wait alec you are too weak to see even bori i wait and i grew strong in a few day i was abl to see whom i would but meanwhil i had thought and rememb from the moment when all the past grew clear again in my mind i never doubt what i should do when the time came and i felt sure that bori would have resolv upon the same cours so far as he was concern as for what pertain to me alon i knew he would see that also as i did i no longer ask for ani one i never inquir whi no messag came from them whi dure the week i lay there wait and grow stronger i never heard their name spoken preoccupi with my own search for the right way and with my feebl but determin fight against despair i simpli acquiesc in jack retic take for grant that he was afraid to speak of them lest i should turn unruli and insist on see them meanwhil i said over and over to myself how would it be when life began again for us all we would take up our relat exact as they were befor geneviev fell ill bori and i would look into each other eye and there would be neither rancour nor cowardic nor mistrust in that glanc i would be with them again for a littl while in the dear intimaci of their home and then without pretext or explan i would disappear from their live for ever bori would know genevieveth onli comfort was that she would never know it seem as i thought it over that i had found the mean of that sens of oblig which had persist all through my delirium and the onli possibl answer to it so when i was quit readi i beckon jack to me one day and said jack i want bori at onc and take my dearest greet to geneviev when at last he made me understand that they were both dead i fell into a wild rage that tore all my littl convalesc strength to atom i rave and curs myself into a relaps from which i crawl forth some week afterward a boy of twenti one who believ that his youth was gone for ever i seem to be past the capabl of further suffer and one day when jack hand me a letter and the key to bori hous i took them without a tremor and ask him to tell me all it was cruel of me to ask him but there was no help for it and he lean wearili on his thin hand to reopen the wound which could never entir heal he began veri quiet alec unless you have a clue that i know noth about you will not be abl to explain ani more than i what has happen i suspect that you would rather not hear these detail but you must learn them els i would spare you the relat god know i wish i could be spare the tell i shall use few word that day when i left you in the doctor care and came back to bori i found him work on the fate geneviev he said was sleep under the influenc of drug she had been quit out of her mind he said he kept on work not talk ani more and i watch him befor long i saw that the third figur of the groupth one look straight ahead out over the worldbor his face not as you ever saw it but as it look then and to the end this is one thing for which i should like to find an explan but i never shall well he work and i watch him in silenc and we went on that way until near midnight then we heard the door open and shut sharpli and a swift rush in the next room bori sprang through the doorway and i follow but we were too late she lay at the bottom of the pool her hand across her breast then bori shot himself through the heart jack stop speak drop of sweat stood under his eye and his thin cheek twitch i carri bori to his room then i went back and let that hellish fluid out of the pool and turn on all the water wash the marbl clean of everi drop when at length i dare descend the step i found her lie there as white as snow at last when i had decid what was best to do i went into the laboratori and first empti the solut in the basin into the wast pipe then i pour the content of everi jar and bottl after it there was wood in the fire place so i built a fire and break the lock of bori cabinet i burnt everi paper notebook and letter that i found there with a mallet from the studio i smash to piec all the empti bottl then load them into a coal scuttl i carri them to the cellar and threw them over the red hot bed of the furnac six time i made the journey and at last not a vestig remain of anyth which might again aid in seek for the formula which bori had found then at last i dare call the doctor he is a good man and togeth we struggl to keep it from the public without him i never could have succeed at last we got the servant paid and sent away into the countri where old rosier keep them quiet with stone of bori and geneviev travel in distant land from whenc they will not return for year we buri bori in the littl cemeteri of sevr the doctor is a good creatur and know when to piti a man who can bear no more he gave his certif of heart diseas and ask no question of me then lift his head from his hand he said open the letter alec it is for us both i tore it open it was bori will date a year befor he left everyth to geneviev and in case of her die childless i was to take control of the hous in the rue saint cecil and jack scott the manag at ept on our death the properti revert to his mother famili in russia with the except of the sculptur marbl execut by himself these he left to me the page blur under our eye and jack got up and walk to the window present he return and sat down again i dread to hear what he was go to say but he spoke with the same simplic and gentl geneviev lie befor the madonna in the marbl room the madonna bend tender abov her and geneviev smile back into that calm face that never would have been except for her his voic broke but he grasp my hand say courag alec next morn he left for ept to fulfil his trust iv the same even i took the key and went into the hous i had known so well everyth was in order but the silenc was terribl though i went twice to the door of the marbl room i could not forc myself to enter it was beyond my strength i went into the smoke room and sat down befor the spinet a small lace handkerchief lay on the key and i turn away choke it was plain i could not stay so i lock everi door everi window and the three front and back gate and went away next morn alcid pack my valis and leav him in charg of my apart i took the orient express for constantinopl dure the two year that i wander through the east at first in our letter we never mention geneviev and bori but gradual their name crept in i recollect particular a passag in one of jack letter repli to one of mine what you tell me of see bori bend over you while you lay ill and feel his touch on your face and hear his voic of cours troubl me this that you describ must have happen a fortnight after he die i say to myself that you were dream that it was part of your delirium but the explan doe not satisfi me nor would it you toward the end of the second year a letter came from jack to me in india so unlik anyth that i had ever known of him that i decid to return at onc to pari he wrote i am well and sell all my pictur as artist do who have no need of money i have not a care of my own but i am more restless than if i had i am unabl to shake off a strang anxieti about you it is not apprehens it is rather a breathless expectancyof what god know i can onli say it is wear me out night i dream alway of you and bori i can never recal anyth afterward but i wake in the morn with my heart beat and all day the excit increas until i fall asleep at night to recal the same experi i am quit exhaust by it

littl i he insist look in splendid health it was good to hear his voic again and as we sat and chat about what life still held for us we felt that it was pleasant to be aliv in the bright spring weather we stay in pari togeth a week and then i went for a week to ept with him but first of all we went to the cemeteri at sevr where bori lay shall we place the fate in the littl grove abov him jack ask and i answer i think onli the madonna should watch over bori grave but jack was none the better for my home come the dream of which he could not retain even the least definit outlin continu and he said that at time the sens of breathless expect was suffoc you see i do you harm and not good i said tri a chang without me so he start alon for a rambl among the channel island and i went back to pari i had not yet enter bori hous now mine sinc my return but i knew it must be done it had been kept in order by jack there were servant there so i gave up my own apart and went there to live instead of the agit i had fear i found myself abl to paint there tranquilli i visit all the roomsal but one i could not bring myself to enter the marbl room where geneviev lay and yet i felt the long grow daili to look upon her face to kneel besid her one april afternoon i lay dream in the smoke room just as i had lain two year befor and mechan i look among the tawni eastern rug for the wolf skin at last i distinguish the point ear and flat cruel head and i thought of my dream where i saw geneviev lie besid it the helmet still hung against the threadbar tapestri among them the old spanish morion which i rememb geneviev had onc put on when we were amus ourselv with the ancient bit of mail i turn my eye to the spinet everi yellow key seem eloqu of her caress hand and i rose drawn by the strength of my life passion to the seal door of the marbl room the heavi door swung inward under my trembl hand sunlight pour through the window tip with gold the wing of cupid and linger like a nimbus over the brow of the madonna her tender face bent in compass over a marbl form so exquisit pure that i knelt and sign myself geneviev lay in the shadow under the madonna and yet through her white arm i saw the pale azur vein and beneath her soft clasp hand the fold of her dress were ting with rose as if from some faint warm light within her breast bend with a break heart i touch the marbl draperi with my lip then crept back into the silent hous a maid came and brought me a letter and i sat down in the littl conservatori to read it but as i was about to break the seal see the girl linger i ask her what she want she stammer someth about a white rabbit that had been caught in the hous and ask what should be done with it i told her to let it loos in the wall garden behind the hous and open my letter it was from jack but so incoher that i thought he must have lost his reason it was noth but a seri of prayer to me not to leav the hous until he could get back he could not tell me whi there were the dream he saidh could explain noth but he was sure that i must not leav the hous in the rue saint cecil as i finish read i rais my eye and saw the same maid servant stand in the doorway hold a glass dish in which two gold fish were swim put them back into the tank and tell me what you mean by interrupt me i said with a half suppress whimper she empti water and fish into an aquarium at the end of the conservatori and turn to me ask my permiss to leav my servic she said peopl were play trick on her evid with a design of get her into troubl the marbl rabbit had been stolen and a live one had been brought into the hous the two beauti marbl fish were gone and she had just found those common live thing flop on the dine room floor i reassur her and sent her away say i would look about myself i went into the studio there was noth there but my canvas and some cast except the marbl of the easter lili i saw it on a tabl across the room then i strode angrili over to it but the flower i lift from the tabl was fresh and fragil and fill the air with perfum then sudden i comprehend and sprang through the hall way to the marbl room the door flew open the sunlight stream into my face and through it in a heaven glori the madonna smile as geneviev lift her flush face from her marbl couch and open her sleepi eye in the court of the dragon oh thou who burnst in heart for those who burn in hell whose fire thyself shall feed in turn how long be cryingmerci on them god whi who art thou to teach and he to learn in the church of st barnab vesper were over the clergi left the altar the littl choir boy flock across the chancel and settl in the stall a suiss in rich uniform march down the south aisl sound his staff at everi fourth step on the stone pavement behind him came that eloqu preacher and good man monseigneur c my chair was near the chancel rail i now turn toward the west end of the church the other peopl between the altar and the pulpit turn too there was a littl scrape and rustl while the congreg seat itself again the preacher mount the pulpit stair and the organ voluntari ceas i had alway found the organ play at st barnab high interest learn and scientif it was too much so for my small knowledg but express a vivid if cold intellig moreov it possess the french qualiti of tast tast reign suprem self control dignifi and retic to day howev from the first chord i had felt a chang for the wors a sinist chang dure vesper it had been chiefli the chancel organ which support the beauti choir but now and again quit wanton as it seem from the west galleri where the great organ stand a heavi hand had struck across the church at the seren peac of those clear voic it was someth more than harsh and disson and it betray no lack of skill as it recur again and again it set me think of what my architect book say about the custom in earli time to consecr the choir as soon as it was built and that the nave be finish sometim half a centuri later often did not get ani bless at all i wonder idl if that had been the case at st barnab and whether someth not usual suppos to be at home in a christian church might have enter undetect and taken possess of the west galleri i had read of such thing happen too but not in work on architectur then i rememb that st barnab was not much more than a hundr year old and smile at the incongru associ of mediaev superstit with that cheer littl piec of eighteenth centuri rococo but now vesper were over and there should have follow a few quiet chord fit to accompani medit while we wait for the sermon instead of that the discord at the lower end of the church broke out with the departur of the clergi as if now noth could control it i belong to those children of an older and simpler generat who do not love to seek for psycholog subtleti in art and i have ever refus to find in music anyth more than melodi and harmoni but i felt that in the labyrinth of sound now issu from that instrument there was someth be hunt up and down the pedal chase him while the manual blare approv poor devil whoever he was there seem small hope of escap my nervous annoy chang to anger who was do this how dare he play like that in the midst of divin servic i glanc at the peopl near me not one appear to be in the least disturb the placid brow of the kneel nun still turn toward the altar lost none of their devout abstract under the pale shadow of their white head dress the fashion ladi besid me was look expect at monseigneur c for all her face betray the organ might have been sing an ave maria but now at last the preacher had made the sign of the cross and command silenc i turn to him glad thus far i had not found the rest i had count on when i enter st barnab that afternoon i was worn out by three night of physic suffer and mental troubl the last had been the worst and it was an exhaust bodi and a mind benumb and yet acut sensit which i had brought to my favourit church for heal for i had been read the king in yellow the sun ariseth they gather themselv togeth and lay them down in their den monseigneur c deliv his text in a calm voic glanc quiet over the congreg my eye turn i knew not whi toward the lower end of the church the organist was come from behind his pipe and pass along the galleri on his way out i saw him disappear by a small door that lead to some stair which descend direct to the street he was a slender man and his face was as white as his coat was black good riddanc i thought with your wick music i hope your assist will play the close voluntari with a feel of reliefwith a deep calm feel of relief i turn back to the mild face in the pulpit and settl myself to listen here at last was the eas of mind i long for my children said the preacher one truth the human soul find hardest of all to learn that it has noth to fear it can never be made to see that noth can realli harm it curious doctrin i thought for a cathol priest let us see how he will reconcil that with the father noth can realli harm the soul he went on in his coolest clearest tone becaus but i never heard the rest my eye left his face i knew not for what reason and sought the lower end of the church the same man was come out from behind the organ and was pass along the galleri the same way but there had not been time for him to return and if he had return i must have seen him i felt a faint chill and my heart sank and yet his go and come were no affair of mine i look at him i could not look away from his black figur and his white face when he was exact opposit to me he turn and sent across the church straight into my eye a look of hate intens and dead i have never seen ani other like it would to god i might never see it again then he disappear by the same door through which i had watch him depart less than sixti second befor i sat and tri to collect my thought my first sensat was like that of a veri young child bad hurt when it catch it breath befor cri out to sudden find myself the object of such hatr was exquisit pain and this man was an utter stranger whi should he hate me some whom he had never seen befor for the moment all other sensat was merg in this one pang even fear was subordin to grief and for that moment i never doubt but in the next i began to reason and a sens of the incongru came to my aid as i have said st barnab is a modern church it is small and well light one see all over it almost at a glanc the organ galleri get a strong white light from a row of long window in the clerestori which have not even colour glass the pulpit be in the middl of the church it follow that when i was turn toward it whatev move at the west end could not fail to attract my eye when the organist pass it was no wonder that i saw him i had simpli miscalcul the interv between his first and his second pass he had come in that last time by the other side door as for the look which had so upset me there had been no such thing and i was a nervous fool i look about this was a like place to harbour supernatur horror that clear cut reason face of monseigneur c his collect manner and easi grace gestur were they not just a littl discourag to the notion of a gruesom mysteri i glanc abov his head and almost laugh that flyaway ladi support one corner of the pulpit canopi which look like a fring damask tabl cloth in a high wind at the first attempt of a basilisk to pose up there in the organ loft she would point her gold trumpet at him and puff him out of exist i laugh to myself over this conceit which at the time i thought veri amus and sat and chaf myself and everyth els from the old harpi outsid the rail who had made me pay ten centim for my chair befor she would let me in she was more like a basilisk i told myself than was my organist with the anaem complexion from that grim old dame to yes ala monseigneur c himself for all devout had fled i had never yet done such a thing in my life but now i felt a desir to mock as for the sermon i could not hear a word of it for the jingl in my ear of the skirt of st paul has reach have preach us those six lent lectur more unctuous than ever he preach keep time to the most fantast and irrever thought it was no use to sit there ani longer i must get out of door and shake myself free from this hate mood i knew the rude i was commit but still i rose and left the church a spring sun was shine on the rue st honor as i ran down the church step on one corner stood a barrow full of yellow jonquil pale violet from the riviera dark russian violet and white roman hyacinth in a golden cloud of mimosa the street was full of sunday pleasur seeker i swung my cane and laugh with the rest some one overtook and pass me he never turn but there was the same dead malign in his white profil that there had been in his eye i watch him as long as i could see him his lith back express the same menac everi step that carri him away from me seem to bear him on some errand connect with my destruct i was creep along my feet

yellow sign let the red dawn surmis what we shall do when this blue starlight die and all is through i there are so mani thing which are imposs to explain whi should certain chord in music make me think of the brown and golden tint of autumn foliag whi should the mass of saint cecil bend my thought wander among cavern whose wall blaze with rag mass of virgin silver what was it in the roar and turmoil of broadway at six oclock that flash befor my eye the pictur of a still breton forest where sunlight filter through spring foliag and sylvia bent half curious half tender over a small green lizard murmur to think that this also is a littl ward of god when i first saw the watchman his back was toward me i look at him indiffer until he went into the church i paid no more attent to him than

inde had she becom tough or fli as the phrase goe but i never notic ani deterior of her manner and felt at heart that she was all right she and i never discuss moral at all and i had no intent of do so part becaus i had none myself and part becaus i knew she would do what she like in spite of me still i did hope she would steer clear of complic becaus i wish her well and then also i had a selfish desir to retain the best model i had i knew that mash as she term it had no signific with girl like tessi and that such thing in america did not resembl in the least the same thing in pari yet have live with my eye open i also knew that somebodi would take tessi away some day in one manner or anoth and though i profess to myself that marriag was nonsens i sincer hope that in this case there would be a priest at the end of the vista i am a cathol when i listen to high mass when i sign myself i feel that everyth includ myself is more cheer and when i confess it doe me good a man who live as much alon as i do must confess to somebodi then again sylvia was cathol and it was reason enough for me but i was speak of tessi which is veri differ tessi also was cathol and much more devout than i so take it all in all i had littl fear for my pretti model until she should fall in love but then i knew that fate alon would decid her futur for her and i pray inward that fate would keep her away from men like me and throw into her path noth but ed burk and jimmi mccormick bless her sweet face tessi sat blow ring of smoke up to the ceil and tinkl the ice in her tumbler do you know that i also had a dream last night i observ not about that man she laugh exact a dream similar to your onli much wors it was foolish and thoughtless of me to say this but you know how littl tact the averag painter has i must have fallen asleep about ten oclock i continu and after a while i dreamt that i awok so plain did i hear the midnight bell the wind in the tree branch and the whistl of steamer from the bay that even now i can scarc believ i was not awak i seem to be lie in a box which had a glass cover dim i saw the street lamp as i pass for i must tell you tessi the box in which i reclin appear to lie in a cushion wagon which jolt me over a stoni pavement after a while i becam impati and tri to move but the box was too narrow my hand were cross on my breast so i could not rais them to help myself i listen and then tri to call my voic was gone i could hear the trampl of the hors attach to the wagon and even the breath of the driver then anoth sound broke upon my ear like the rais of a window sash i manag to turn my head a littl and found i could look not onli through the glass cover of my box but also through the glass pane in the side of the cover vehicl i saw hous empti and silent with neither light nor life about ani of them except one in that hous a window was open on the first floor and a figur all in white stood look down into the street it was you tessi had turn her face away from me and lean on the tabl with her elbow i could see your face i resum and it seem to me to be veri sorrow then we pass on and turn into a narrow black lane present the hors stop i wait and wait close my eye with ear and impati but all was silent as the grave after what seem to me hour i began to feel uncomfort a sens that somebodi was close to me made me unclos my eye then i saw the white face of the hears driver look at me through the coffin lid a sob from tessi interrupt me she was trembl like a leaf i saw i had made an ass of myself and attempt to repair the damag whi tess i said i onli told you this to show you what influenc your stori might have on anoth person dream you dont suppos i realli lay in a coffin do you what are you trembl for dont you see that your dream and my unreason dislik for that inoffens watchman of the church simpli set my brain work as soon as i fell asleep she laid her head between her arm and sob as if her heart would break what a precious tripl donkey i had made of myself but i was about to break my record i went over and put my arm about her tessi dear forgiv me i said i had no busi to frighten you with such nonsens you are too sensibl a girl too good a cathol to believ in dream her hand tighten on mine and her head fell back upon my shoulder but she still trembl and i pet her and comfort her come tess open your eye and smile her eye open with a slow languid movement and met mine but their express was so queer that i hasten to reassur her again it all humbug tessi you sure are not afraid that ani harm will come to you becaus of that no she said but her scarlet lip quiver then what the matter are you afraid yes not for myself for me then i demand gaili for you she murmur in a voic almost inaud ii care for you at first i start to laugh but when i understood her a shock pass through me and i sat like one turn to stone this was the crown bit of idioci i had commit dure the moment which elaps between her repli and my answer i thought of a thousand respons to that innoc confess i could pass it by with a laugh i could misunderstand her and assur her as to my health i could simpli point out that it was imposs she could love me but my repli was quicker than my thought and i might think and think now when it was too late for i had kiss her on the mouth that even i took my usual walk in washington park ponder over the occurr of the day i was thorough commit there was no back out now and i stare the futur straight in the face i was not good not even scrupul but i had no idea of deceiv either myself or tessi the one passion of my life lay buri in the sunlit forest of brittani was it buri for ever hope cri no for three year i had been listen to the voic of hope and for three year i had wait for a footstep on my threshold had sylvia forgotten no cri hope i said that i was no good that is true but still i was not exact a comic opera villain i had led an easi go reckless life take what invit me of pleasur deplor and sometim bitter regret consequ in one thing alon except my paint was i serious and that was someth which lay hidden if not lost in the breton forest it was too late for me to regret what had occur dure the day whatev it had been piti a sudden tender for sorrow or the more brutal instinct of gratifi vaniti it was all the same now and unless i wish to bruis an innoc heart my path lay mark befor me the fire and strength the depth of passion of a love which i had never even suspect with all my imagin experi in the world left me no altern but to respond or send her away whether becaus i am so coward about give pain to other or whether it was that i have littl of the gloomi puritan in me i do not know but i shrank from disclaim respons for that thoughtless kiss and in fact had no time to do so befor the gate of her heart open and the flood pour forth other who habitu do their duti and find a sullen satisfact in make themselv and everybodi els unhappi might have withstood it i did not i dare not after the storm had abat i did tell her that she might better have love ed burk and worn a plain gold ring but she would not hear of it and i thought perhap as long as she had decid to love somebodi she could not marri it had better be me i at least could treat her with an intellig affect and whenev she becam tire of her infatu she could go none the wors for it for i was decid on that point although i knew how hard it would be i rememb the usual termin of platon liaison and thought how disgust i had been whenev i heard of one i knew i was undertak a great deal for so unscrupul a man as i was and i dream the futur but never for one moment did i doubt that she was safe with me had it been anybodi but tessi i should not have bother my head about scrupl for it did not occur to me to sacrific tessi as i would have sacrif a woman of the world i look the futur squar in the face and saw the sever probabl end to the affair she would either tire of the whole thing or becom so unhappi that i should have either to marri her or go away if i marri her we would be unhappi i with a wife unsuit to me and she with a husband unsuit for ani woman for my past life could scarc entitl me to marri if i went away she might either fall ill recov and marri some eddi burk or she might reckless or deliber go and do someth foolish on the other hand if she tire of me then her whole life would be befor her with beauti vista of eddi burk and marriag ring and twin and harlem flat and heaven know what as i stroll along through the tree by the washington arch i decid that she should find a substanti friend in me anyway and the futur could take care of itself then i went into the hous and put on my even dress for the littl faint perfum note on my dresser said have a cab at the stage door at eleven and the note was sign edith carmichel metropolitan theatr i took supper that night or rather we took supper miss carmichel and i at solari and the dawn was just begin to gild the cross on the memori church as i enter washington squar after leav edith at the brunswick there was not a soul in the park as i pass along the tree and took the walk which lead from the garibaldi statu to the hamilton apart hous but as i pass the churchyard i saw a figur sit on the stone step in spite of myself a chill crept over me at the sight of the white puffi face and i hasten to pass then he said someth which might have been address to me or might mere have been a mutter to himself but a sudden furious anger flame up within me that such a creatur should address me for an instant i felt like wheel about and smash my stick over his head but i walk on and enter the hamilton went to my apart for some time i toss about the bed tri to get the sound of his voic out of my ear but could not it fill my head that mutter sound like thick oili smoke from a fat render vat or an odour of noisom decay and as i lay and toss about the voic in my ear seem more distinct and i began to understand the word he had mutter they came to me slowli as if i had forgotten them and at last i could make some sens out of the sound it was this have you found the yellow sign have you found the yellow sign have you found the yellow sign i was furious what did he mean by that then with a curs upon him and his i roll over and went to sleep but when i awok later i look pale and haggard for i had dream the dream of the night befor and it troubl me more than i care to think i dress and went down into my studio tessi sat by the window but as i came in she rose and put both arm around my neck for an innoc kiss she look so sweet and dainti that i kiss her again and then sat down befor the easel hello where the studi i began yesterday i ask tessi look conscious but did not answer i began to hunt among the pile of canvas say hurri up tess and get readi we must take advantag of the morn light when at last i gave up the search among the other canvas and turn to look around the room for the miss studi i notic tessi stand by the screen with her cloth still on what the matter i ask dont you feel well yes then hurri do you want me to pose asa i have alway pose then i understood here was a new complic i had lost of cours the best nude model i had ever seen i look at tessi her face was scarlet ala ala we had eaten of the tree of knowledg and eden and nativ innoc were dream of the pasti mean for her i suppos she notic the disappoint on my face for she said i will pose if you wish the studi is behind the screen here where i put it no i said we will begin someth new and i went into my wardrob and

that she knew and read my thought as i read her for we had understood the mysteri of the hyad and the phantom of truth was laid then as we answer each other swift silent thought on thought the shadow stir in the gloom about us and far in the distant street we heard a sound nearer and nearer it came the dull crunch of wheel nearer and yet nearer and now outsid befor the door it ceas and i drag myself to the window and saw a black plume hears the gate below open and shut and i crept shake to my door and bolt it but i knew no bolt no lock could keep that creatur out who was come for the

not the way of an eagl in the air the way of a serpent upon a rock the way of a ship in the midst of the sea and the way of a man with a maid i the utter desol of the scene began to have it effect i sat down to face the situat and if possibl recal to mind some landmark which might aid me in extric myself from my present posit if i could onli find the ocean again all would be clear for i knew one could see the island of groix from the cliff i laid down my gun and kneel behind a rock light a pipe then i look at my watch it was near four oclock i might have wander far from kerselec sinc daybreak stand the day befor on the cliff below kerselec with goulven look out over the sombr moor among which i had now lost my way these down had appear to me level as a meadow stretch to the horizon and although i knew how decept is distanc i could not realiz that what from kerselec seem to be mere grassi hollow were great valley cover with gors and heather and what look like scatter boulder were in realiti enorm cliff of granit it a bad place for a stranger old goulven had said youd better take a guid and i had repli i shall not lose myself now i knew that i had lost myself as i sat there smoke with the sea wind blow in my face on everi side stretch the moorland cover with flower gors and heath and granit boulder there was not a tree in sight much less a hous after a while i pick up the gun and turn my back on the sun tramp on again there was littl use in follow ani of the brawl stream which everi now and then cross my path for instead of flow into the sea they ran inland to reedi pool in the hollow of the moor i had follow sever but they all led me to swamp or silent littl pond from which the snipe rose peep and wheel away in an ecstasi of fright i began to feel fatigu and the gun gall my shoulder in spite of the doubl pad the sun sank lower and lower shine level across yellow gors and the moorland pool as i walk my own gigant shadow led me on seem to lengthen at everi step the gors scrape against my leg crackl beneath my feet shower the brown earth with blossom and the brake bow and billow along my path from tuft of heath rabbit scurri away through the bracken and among the swamp grass i heard the wild duck drowsi quack onc a fox stole across my path and again as i stoop to drink at a hurri rill a heron flap heavili from the reed besid me i turn to look at the sun it seem to touch the edg of the plain when at last i decid that it was useless to go on and that i must make up my mind to spend at least one night on the moor i threw myself down thorough fag out the even sunlight slant warm across my bodi but the sea wind began to rise and i felt a chill strike through me from my wet shoot boot high overhead gull were wheel and toss like bit of white paper from some distant marsh a solitari curlew call littl by littl the sun sank into the plain and the zenith flush with the after glow i watch the sky chang from palest gold to pink and then to smoulder fire cloud of midg danc abov me and high in the calm air a bat dip and soar my eyelid began to droop then as i shook off the drowsi a sudden crash among the bracken rous me i rais my eye a great bird hung quiver in the air abov my face for an instant i stare incap of motion then someth leap past me in the fern and the bird rose wheel and pitch headlong into the brake i was on my feet in an instant peer through the gors there came the sound of a struggl from a bunch of heather close by and then all was quiet i step forward my gun pois but when i came to the heather the gun fell under my arm again and i stood motionless in silent astonish a dead hare lay on the ground and on the hare stood a magnific falcon one talon buri in the creatur neck the other plant firm on it limp flank but what astonish me was not the mere sight of a falcon sit upon it prey i had seen that more than onc it was that the falcon was fit with a sort of leash about both talon and from the leash hung a round bit of metal like a sleigh bell the bird turn it fierc yellow eye on me and then stoop and struck it curv beak into the quarri at the same instant hurri step sound among the heather and a girl sprang into the covert in front without a glanc at me she walk up to the falcon and pass her glove hand under it breast rais it from the quarri then she deft slip a small hood over the bird head and hold it out on her gauntlet stoop and pick up the hare she pass a cord about the anim leg and fasten the end of the thong to her girdl then she start to retrac her step through the covert as she pass me i rais my cap and she acknowledg my presenc with a scarc percept inclin i had been so astonish so lost in admir of the scene befor my eye that it had not occur to me that here was my salvat but as she move away i recollect that unless i want to sleep on a windi moor that night i had better recov my speech without delay at my first word she hesit and as i step befor her i thought a look of fear came into her beauti eye but as i humbl explain my unpleas plight her face flush and she look at me in wonder sure you did not come from kerselec she repeat her sweet voic had no trace of the breton accent nor of ani accent which i knew and yet there was someth in it i seem to have heard befor someth quaint and indefin like the theme of an old song i explain that i was an american unacquaint with finister shoot there for my own amus an american she repeat in the same quaint music tone i have never befor seen an american for a moment she stood silent then look at me she said if you should walk all night

mist the plover had ceas their call the cricket and all the littl creatur of the field were silent as we pass yet it seem to me as if i could hear them begin again far behind us well in advanc the two tall falcon strode across the heather and the faint jingl of the hawk bell came to our ear in distant murmur chime sudden a splendid hound dash out of the mist in front follow by anoth and anoth until half a dozen or more were bound and leap around the girl besid me she caress and quiet them with her glove hand speak to them in quaint term which i rememb to have seen in old french manuscript then the falcon on the circlet born by the falcon ahead began to beat their wing and scream and from somewher out of sight the note of a hunt horn float across the moor the hound sprang away befor us and vanish in the twilight the falcon flap and squeal upon their perch and the girl take up the song of the horn began to hum clear and mellow her voic sound in the night air chasseur chasseur chassez encor quittez rosett et jeanneton tonton tonton tontain tonton ou pour rabattr des lauror que les amour soient de planton tonton tontain tonton as i listen to her love voic a grey mass which rapid grew more distinct loom up in front and the horn rang out joyous through the tumult of the hound and falcon a torch glimmer at a gate a light stream through an open door and we step upon a wooden bridg which trembl under our feet and rose creak and strain behind us as we pass over the moat and into a small stone court wall on everi side from an open doorway a man came and bend in salut present

rue barre acknowledg his solemn salut forti time a day he bless rue barre for her refus and thank his lucki star and at the same time oh wondrous heart of oursh suffer the tortur of the blight elliott was annoy part by clifford retic part by the unexplain thaw in the frigid of rue barre at their frequent encount when she trip along the rue de sein with music roll and big straw hat would pass clifford and his familiar steer an easter cours to the cafe vachett and at the respect uncov of the band would colour and smile at clifford elliott slumber suspicion awok but he never found out anyth and final gave it up as beyond his comprehens mere qualifi clifford as an idiot and reserv his opinion of rue barre and all this time selbi was jealous at first he refus to acknowledg it to himself and cut the studio for a day in the countri but the wood and field of cours aggrav his case and the brook babbl of rue barre and the mower call to each other across the meadow end in a quaver rue bar ree e that day spent in the countri made him angri for a week and he work sulkili at julian all the time torment by a desir to know where clifford was and what he might be do this culmin in an errat stroll on sunday which end at the flower market on the pont au chang began again was gloomili extend to the morgu and again end at the marbl bridg it would never do and selbi felt it so he went to see clifford who was convalesc on mint julep in his garden they sat down togeth and discuss moral and human happi and each found the other most entertain onli selbi fail to pump clifford to the other unfeign amus but the julep spread balm on the sting of jealousi and trickl hope to the blight and when selbi said he must go clifford went too and when selbi not to be outdon insist on accompani clifford back to his door clifford determin to see selbi back half way and then find it hard to part they decid to dine togeth and flit to flit a verb appli to clifford nocturn prowl express perhap as well as anyth the gaieti propos dinner was order at mignon and while selbi interview the chef clifford kept a father eye on the butler the dinner was a success or was of the sort general term a success toward the dessert selbi heard some one say as at a great distanc kid selbi drunk as a lord a group of men pass near them it seem to him that he shook hand and laugh a great deal and that everybodi was veri witti there was clifford opposit swear undi confid in his chum selbi and there seem to be other there either seat besid them or continu pass with the swish of skirt on the polish floor the perfum of rose the rustl of fan the touch of round arm and the laughter grew vaguer and vaguer the room seem envelop in mist then all in a moment each object stood out pain distinct onli form and visag were distort and voic pierc he drew himself up calm grave for the moment master of himself but veri drunk he knew he was drunk and was as guard and alert as keen suspici of himself as he would have been of a thief at his elbow his self command enabl clifford to hold his head safe under some run water and repair to the street consider the wors for wear but never suspect that his companion was drunk for a time he kept his self command his face was onli a bit paler a bit tighter than usual he was onli a trifl slower and more fastidi in his speech it was midnight when he left clifford peac slumber in somebodi arm chair with a long sued glove dangl in his hand and a plumi boa twist about his neck to protect his throat from draft he walk through the hall and down the stair and found himself on the sidewalk in a quarter he did not know mechan he look up at the name of the street the name was not familiar he turn and steer his cours toward some light cluster at the end of the street they prove farther away than he had anticip and after a long quest he came to the conclus that his eye had been mysteri remov from their proper place and had been reset on either side of his head like those of a bird it griev him to think of the inconveni this transform might occas him and he attempt to cock up his head hen like to test the mobil of his neck then an immens despair stole over himtear gather in the tear duct his heart melt and he collid with a tree this shock him into comprehens he stifl the violent tender in his breast pick up his hat and move on more brisk his mouth was white and drawn his teeth tight clinch he held his cours pretti well and stray but littl and after an appar intermin length of time found himself pass a line of cab the brilliant lamp red yellow and green annoy him and he felt it might be pleasant to demolish them with his cane but master this impuls he pass on later an idea struck him that it would save fatigu to take a cab and he start back with that intent but the cab seem alreadi so far away and the lantern were so bright and confus that he gave it up and pull himself togeth look around a shadow a mass huge undefin rose to his right he recogn the arc de triomph and grave shook his cane at it it size annoy him he felt it was too big then he heard someth fall clatter to the pavement and thought probabl it was his cane but it didnt much matter when he had master himself and regain control of his right leg which betray symptom of insubordin he found himself travers the place de la concord at a pace which threaten to land him at the madelein this would never do he turn sharpli to the right and cross the bridg pass the palai bourbon at a trot and wheel into the boulevard st germain he got on well enough although the size of the war offic struck him as a person insult and he miss his cane which it would have been pleasant to drag along the iron rail as he pass it occur to him howev to substitut his hat but when he found it he forgot what he want it for and replac it upon his head with graviti then he was oblig to battl with a violent inclin to sit down and weep this last until he came to the rue de renn but there he becam absorb in contempl the dragon on the balconi overhang the cour du dragon and time slip away until he rememb vagu that he had no busi there and march off again it was slow work the inclin to sit down and weep had given place to a desir for solitari and deep reflect here his right leg forgot it obedi and attack the left outflank it and brought him up against a wooden board which seem to bar his path he tri to walk around it but found the street close he tri to push it over and found he couldnt then he notic a red lantern stand on a pile of pave stone insid the barrier this was pleasant how was he to get home if the boulevard was block but he was not on the boulevard his treacher right leg had beguil him into a detour for there behind him lay the boulevard with it endless line of lampsand here what was this narrow dilapid street pile up with earth and mortar and heap of stone he look up written in stare black letter on the barrier was rue barre he sat down two policemen whom he knew came by and advis him to get up but he argu the question from a standpoint of person tast and they pass on laugh for he was at that moment absorb in a problem it was how to see rue barre she was somewher or other in that big hous with the iron balconi and the door was lock but what of that the simpl idea struck him to shout until she came this idea was replac by anoth equal lucidto hammer on the door until she came but final reject both of these as too uncertain he decid to climb into the balconi and open a window polit inquir for rue barre there was but one light window in the hous that he could see it was on the second floor and toward this he cast his eye then mount the wooden barrier and clamber over the pile of stone he reach the sidewalk and look up at the facad for a foothold it seem imposs but a sudden furi seiz him a blind drunken obstinaci and the blood rush to his head leap beat in his ear like the dull thunder of an ocean he set his teeth and spring at a window sill drag himself up and hung to the iron bar then reason fled there surg in his brain the sound of mani voic his heart leap up beat a mad tattoo and grip at cornic and ledg he work his way along the facad clung to pipe and shutter and drag himself up over and into the balconi by the light window his hat fell off and roll against the pane for a moment he lean breathless against the railingthen the window was slowli open from within they stare at each other for some time present the girl took two unsteadi step back into the room he saw her faceal crimson nowh saw her sink into a chair by the lamplit tabl and without a word he follow her into the room close the big door like pane behind him then they look at each other in silenc the room was small and white everyth was white about itth curtain bed the littl wash stand in the corner the bare wall the china lampand his own facehad he known it but the face and neck of rue were surg in the colour that dy the blossom rose tree there on the hearth besid her it did not occur to him to speak she seem not to expect it his mind was struggl with the impress of the room the white the extrem puriti of everyth occupi himbegan to troubl him as his eye becam accustom to the light other object grew from the surround and took their place in the circl of lamplight there was a piano and a coal scuttl and a littl iron trunk and a bath tub then there was a row of wooden peg against the door with a white chintz curtain cover the cloth underneath on the bed lay an umbrella and a big straw hat and on the tabl a music roll unfurl an ink stand and sheet of rule paper behind him stood a wardrob face with a mirror but somehow he did not care to see his own face just then he was sober the girl sat look at him without a word her face was expressionless yet the lip at time trembl almost impercept her eye so wonder blue in the daylight seem dark and soft as velvet and the colour on her neck deepen and whiten with everi breath she seem smaller and more slender than when he had seen her in the street and there was now someth in the curv of her cheek almost infantin when at last he turn and caught his own reflect in the mirror behind him a shock pass through him as though he had seen a shame thing and his cloud mind and his cloud thought grew clearer for a moment their eye met then his sought the floor his lip tighten and the struggl within him bow his head and strain everi nerv to the break and now it was over for the voic within had spoken he listen dulli interest but alreadi know the endinde it littl matteredth end would alway be the same for himh understood nowalway the same for him and he listen dulli interest to a voic which grew within him after a while he stood up and she rose at onc one small hand rest on the tabl present he open the window pick up his hat and shut it again then he went over to the rosebush and touch the blossom with his face one was stand in a glass of water on the tabl and mechan the girl drew it out press it with her lip and laid it on the tabl besid him he took it without a word and cross the room open the door the land was dark and silent but the girl lift
