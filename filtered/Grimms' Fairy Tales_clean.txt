was onc an old castl that stood in the middl of a deep gloomi wood and in the castl live an old fairi now this fairi could take ani shape she pleas all the day long she flew about in the form of an owl or crept about the countri like a cat but at night she alway becam an old woman again when ani young man came within a hundr pace of her castl he becam quit fix and could not move a step till she came and set him free which she would not do till he had given her his word never to come there again but when ani pretti maiden came within that space she was chang into a bird and the fairi put her into a cage and hung her up in a chamber in the castl there were seven hundr of these cage hang in the castl and all with beauti bird in them now there was onc a maiden whose name was jorinda she was prettier than all the pretti girl that ever were seen befor and a shepherd lad whose name was jorindel was veri fond of her and they were soon to be marri one day they went to walk in the wood that they might be alon and jorindel said we must take care that we dont go too near to the fairi castl it was a beauti even the last ray of the set sun shone bright through the long stem of the tree upon the green underwood beneath and the turtl dove sang from the tall birch jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun jorindel sat by her side and both felt sad they knew not whi but it seem as if they were to be part from one anoth for ever they had wander a long way and when they look to see which way they should go home they found themselv at a loss to know what path to take the sun was set fast and alreadi half of it circl had sunk behind the hill jorindel on a sudden look behind him and saw through the bush that they had without know it sat down close under the old wall of the castl then he shrank for fear turn pale and trembl jorinda was just sing the ring dove sang from the willow spray well a day well a day he mournd for the fate of his darl mate well a day when her song stop sudden jorindel turn to see the reason and beheld his jorinda chang into a nightingal so that her song end with a mourn jug jug an owl with fieri eye flew three time round them and three time scream tu whu tu whu tu whu jorindel could not move he stood fix as a stone and could neither weep nor speak nor stir hand or foot and now the sun went quit down the gloomi night came the owl flew into a bush and a moment after the old fairi came forth pale and meagr with stare eye and a nose and chin that almost met one anoth she mumbl someth to herself seiz the nightingal and went away with it in her hand poor jorindel saw the nightingal was gonebut what could he do he could not speak he could not move from the spot where he stood at last the fairi came back and sang with a hoars voic till the prison is fast and her doom is cast there stay oh stay when the charm is around her and the spell has bound her hie away away on a sudden jorindel found himself free then he fell on his knee befor the fairi and pray her to give him back his dear jorinda but she laugh at him and said he should never see her again then she went her way he pray he wept he sorrow but all in vain ala he said what will becom of me he could not go back to his own home so he went to a strang villag and employ himself in keep sheep mani a time did he walk round and round as near to the hate castl as he dare go but all in vain he heard or saw noth of jorinda at last he dreamt one night that he found a beauti purpl flower and that in the middl of it lay a cost pearl and he dreamt that he pluck the flower and went with it in his hand into the castl and that everyth he touch with it was disench and that there he found his jorinda again in the morn when he awok he began to search over hill and dale for this pretti flower and eight long day he sought for it in vain but on the ninth day earli in the morn he found the beauti purpl flower and in the middl of it was a larg dewdrop as big as a cost pearl then he pluck the flower and set out and travel day and night till he came again to the castl he walk nearer than a hundr pace to it and yet he did not becom fix as befor but found that he could go quit close up to the door jorindel was veri glad inde to see this then he touch the door with the flower and it sprang open so that he went in through the court and listen when he heard so mani bird sing at last he came to the chamber where the fairi sat with the seven hundr bird sing in the seven hundr cage when she saw jorindel she was veri angri and scream with rage but she could not come within two yard of him for the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard he look around at the bird but ala there were mani mani nightingal and how then should he find out which was his jorinda while he was think what to do he saw the fairi had taken down one of the cage and was make the best of her way off through the door he ran or flew after her touch the cage with the flower and jorinda stood befor him and threw her arm round his neck look as beauti as ever as beauti as when they walk togeth in the wood then he touch all the other bird with the flower so that they all took their old form again and he took jorinda home where they were marri and live happili togeth mani year and so did a good mani other lad whose maiden had been forc to sing in the old fairi cage by themselv much longer than they like the travel musician an honest farmer had onc an ass that had been a faith servant to him a great mani year but was now grow old and everi day more and more unfit for work his master therefor was tire

task but he succeed no better than the first for he could onli find the second hundr of the pearl and therefor he too was turn into stone at last came the littl dwarf turn and he look in the moss but it was so hard to find the pearl and the job was so tiresomeso he sat down upon a stone and cri and as he sat there the king of the ant whose life he had save came to help him with five thousand ant and it was not long befor they had found all the pearl and laid them in a heap the second tablet said the key of the princesss bed chamber must be fish up out of the lake and as the dwarf came to the brink of it he saw the two duck whose live he had save swim about and they dive down and soon brought in the key from the bottom the third task was the hardest it was to choos out the youngest and the best of the king three daughter now they were all beauti and all exact alik but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piec of sugar the next some sweet syrup and the youngest a spoon of honey so he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey then came the queen of the bee who had been save by the littl dwarf from the fire and she tri the lip of all three but at last she sat upon the lip of the one that had eaten the honey and so the dwarf knew which was the youngest thus the spell was broken and all who had been turn into stone awok and took their proper form and the dwarf marri the

get larger and larger and seem as if it would never ceas grow so that it might have been call the princ of turnip for there never was such a one seen befor and never will again at last it was so big that it fill a cart and two oxen could hard draw it and the garden knew not what in the world to do with it nor whether it would be a bless or a curs to him one day he said to himself what shall i do with it if i sell it it will bring no more than anoth and for eat the littl turnip are better than this the best thing perhap is to carri it and give it to the king as a mark of respect then he yoke his oxen and drew the turnip to the court and gave it to the king what a wonder thing said the king i have seen mani strang thing but such a monster as this i never saw where did you get the seed or is it onli your good luck if so you are a true child of fortun ah no answer the garden i am no child of fortun i am a poor soldier who never could get enough to live upon so i laid asid my red coat and set to work till the ground i have a brother who is rich and your majesti know him well and all the world know him but becaus i am poor everybodi forget me the king then took piti on him and said you shall be poor no longer i will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your brother then he gave him gold and land and flock and made him so rich that his brother fortun could not at all be compar with his when the brother heard of all this and how a turnip had made the garden so rich he envi him sore and bethought himself how he could contriv to get the same good fortun for himself howev he determin to manag more clever than his brother and got togeth a rich present of gold and fine hors for the king and thought he must have a much larger gift in return for if his brother had receiv so much for onli a turnip what must his present be worth the king took the gift veri gracious and said he knew not what to give in return more valuabl and wonder than the great turnip so the soldier was forc to put it into a cart and drag it home with him when he reach home he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite and at length wick thought came into his head and he resolv to kill his brother so he hire some villain to murder him and have shown them where to lie in ambush he went to his brother and said dear brother i have found a hidden treasur let us go and dig it up and share it between us the other had no suspicion of his rogueri so they went out togeth and as they were travel along the murder rush out upon him bound him and were go to hang him on a tree but whilst they were get all readi they heard the trampl of a hors at a distanc which so frighten them that they push their prison neck and shoulder togeth into a sack and swung him up by a cord to the tree where they left him dangl and ran away meantim he work and work away till he made a hole larg enough to put out his head when the horseman came up he prove to be a student a merri fellow who was journey along on his nag and sing as he went as soon as the man in the sack saw him pass under the tree he cri out good morn good morn to thee my friend the student look about everywher and see no one and not know where the voic came from cri out who call me then the man in the tree answer lift up thine eye for behold here i sit in the sack of wisdom here have i in a short time learn great and wondrous thing compar to this seat all the learn of the school is as empti air a littl longer and i shall know all that man can know and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind here i

wert thou but onc here my friend though wouldst feel and own the power of knowledg the student listen to all this and wonder much at last he said bless be the day and hour when i found you cannot you contriv to let me into the sack for a littl while then the other answer as if veri unwil a littl space i may allow thee to sit here if thou wilt reward me well and entreat me kind but thou must tarri yet an hour below till i have learnt some littl matter that are yet unknown to me so the student sat himself down and wait a while but the time hung heavi upon him and he beg earnest that he might ascend forthwith for his thirst for knowledg was great then the other pretend to give way and said thou must let the sack of wisdom descend by unti yonder cord and then thou shalt enter so the student let him down open the sack and set him free now then cri he let me ascend quick as he began to put himself into the sack heel first wait a while said the garden that is not the way then he push him in head first tie up the sack and soon swung up the searcher after wisdom dangl in the air how is it with thee friend said he dost thou not feel that wisdom come unto thee rest there in peac till thou art a wiser man than thou wert so say he trot off on the student nag and left the poor fellow to gather wisdom till somebodi should come and let him down clever han the mother of han said whither away

a chanc for us let us tri what we can do and they agre to see whether they could not set the princess free i will soon find out where she is howev said the star gazer as he look through his glass and he soon cri out i see her afar off sit upon a rock in the sea and i can spi the dragon close by guard her then he went to the king and ask for a ship for himself and his brother and they sail togeth over the sea till they came to the right place there they found the princess sit as the star gazer had said on the rock and the dragon was lie asleep with his head upon her lap i dare not shoot at him said the huntsman for i should kill the beauti young ladi also then i will tri my skill said the thief and went and stole her away from under the dragon so quiet and gentl that the beast did not know it but went on snore then away they hasten with her full of joy in their boat toward the ship but soon came the dragon roar behind them through the air for he awok and miss the princess but when he got over the boat and want to pounc upon them and carri off the princess the huntsman took up his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down dead they were still not safe for he was such a great beast that in his fall he overset the boat and they had to swim in the open sea upon a few plank so the tailor took his needl and with a few larg stitch put some of the plank togeth and he sat down upon these and sail about and gather up all piec of the boat and then tack them togeth so quick that the boat was soon readi and they then reach the ship and got home safe when they had brought home the princess to her father there was great rejoic and he said to the four brother one of you shall marri her but you must settl amongst yourselv which it is to be then there aros a quarrel between them and the star gazer said if i had not found the princess out all your skill would have been of no use therefor she ought to be mine your see her would have been of no use said the thief if i had not taken her away from the dragon therefor she ought to be mine no she is mine said the huntsman for if i had not kill the dragon he would after all have torn you and the princess into piec and if i had not sewn the boat togeth again said the tailor you would all have been drown therefor she is mine then the king put in a word and said each of you is right and as all cannot have the young ladi the best way is for neither of you to have her for the truth is there is somebodi she like a great deal better but to make up for your loss i will give each of you as a reward for his skill half a kingdom so the brother agre that this plan would be much better than either quarrel or marri a ladi who had no mind to have them and the king then gave to each half a kingdom as he had said and they live veri happili the rest of their day and took good care of their father and somebodi took better care of the young ladi than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have her again lili and the lion a merchant who had three daughter was onc set out upon a journey but befor he went he ask each daughter what gift he should bring back for her the eldest wish for pearl the second for jewel but the third who was call lili said dear father bring me a rose now it was no easi task to find a rose for it was the middl of winter yet as she was his prettiest daughter and was veri fond of flower her father said he would tri what he could do so he kiss all three and bid them goodby and when the time came for him to go home he had bought pearl and jewel for the two eldest but he had sought everywher in vain for the rose and when he went into ani garden and ask for such a thing the peopl laugh at him and ask him whether he thought rose grew in snow this griev him veri much for lili was his dearest child and as he was journey home think what he should bring her he came to a fine castl and around the castl was a garden in one half of which it seem to be summer time and in the other half winter on one side the finest flower were in full bloom and on the other everyth look dreari and buri in the snow a lucki hit said he as he call to his servant and told him to go to a beauti bed of rose that was there and bring him away one of the finest flower this done they were ride away well pleas when up sprang a fierc lion and roar out whoever has stolen my rose shall be eaten up aliv then the man said i knew not that the garden belong to you can noth save my life no said the lion noth unless you undertak to give me whatev meet you on your return home if you agre to this i will give you your life and the rose too for your daughter but the man was unwil to do so and said it may be my youngest daughter who love me most and alway run to meet me when i go home then the servant was great frighten and said it may perhap be onli a cat or a dog and at last the man yield with a heavi heart and took the rose and said he would give the lion whatev should meet him first on his return and as he came near home it was lili his youngest and dearest daughter that met him she came run and kiss him and welcom him home and when she saw that he had brought her the rose she was still more glad but her father began to be veri sorrow and to weep say ala my dearest child i have bought this flower at a high price for i have said i would give you to a wild lion and when he has you he will tear you in piec and eat you then he told her all that had happen and said she should not go let what would happen but she comfort him and said dear father the word you have given must be kept i will go to the lion and sooth him perhap he will let me come safe home again the next morn she ask the way she was to go and took leav of her father and went forth with a bold heart into the wood but the lion was an enchant princ by day he and all his court were lion but in the even they took their right form again and when lili came to the castl he welcom her so courteous that she agre to marri him the wed feast was held and they live happili togeth a long time the princ was onli to be seen as soon as even came and then he held his court but everi morn he left his bride and went away by himself she knew not whither till the night came again after some time he said to her tomorrow there will be a great feast in your father hous for your eldest sister is to be marri and if you wish to go and visit her my lion shall lead you thither then she rejoic much at the thought of see her father onc more and set out with the lion and everyon was overjoy to see her for they had thought her dead long sinc but she told them how happi she was and stay till the feast was over and then went back to the wood her second sister was soon after marri and when lili was ask to go to the wed she said to the princ i will not go alon this timeyou must go with me but he would not and said that it would be a veri hazard thing for if the least ray of the torch light should fall upon him his enchant would becom still wors for he should be chang into a dove and be forc to wander about the world for seven long year howev she gave him no rest and said she would take care no light should fall upon him so at last they set out togeth and took with them their littl child and she chose a larg hall with thick wall for him to sit in while the wed torch were light but unluckili no one saw that there was a crack in the door then the wed was held with great pomp but as the train came from the church and pass with the torch befor the hall a veri small ray of light fell upon the princ in a moment he disappear and when his wife came in and look for him she found onli a white dove and it said to her seven year must i fli up and down over the face of the earth but everi now and then i will let fall a white feather that will show you the way i am go follow it and at last you may overtak and set me free this said he flew out at the door and poor lili follow and everi now and then a white feather fell and show her the way she was to journey thus she went rove on through the wide world and look neither to the right hand nor to the left nor took ani rest for seven year then she began to be glad and thought to herself that the time was fast come when all her troubl should end yet repos was still far off for one day as she was travel on she miss the white feather and when she lift up her eye she could nowher see the dove now thought she to herself no aid of man can be of use to me so she went to the sun and said thou shinest everywher on the hill top and the valley depthhast thou anywher seen my white dove no said the sun i have not seen it but i will give thee a casketopen it when thi hour of need come so she thank the sun and went on her way till eventid and when the moon aros she cri unto it and said thou shinest through the night over field and grovehast thou nowher seen my white dove no said the moon i cannot help thee but i will give thee an eggbreak it when need come then she thank the moon and went on till the night wind blew and she rais up her voic to it and said thou blowest through everi tree and under everi leafhast thou not seen my white dove no said the night wind but i will ask three other wind perhap they have seen it then the east wind and the west wind came and said they too had not seen it but the south wind said i have seen the white doveh has fled to the red sea and is chang onc more into a lion for the seven year are pass away and there he is fight with a dragon and the dragon is an enchant princess who seek to separ him from you then the night wind said i will give thee counsel go to the red sea on the right shore stand mani rodscount them and when thou comest to the eleventh break it off and smite the dragon with it and so the lion will have the victori and both of them will appear to you in their own form then look round and thou wilt see a griffin wing like bird sit by the red sea jump on to his back with thi belov one as quick as possibl and he will carri you over the water to your home i will also give thee this nut continu the night wind when you are half way over throw it down and out of the water will immedi spring up a high nut tree on which the griffin will be abl to rest otherwis he would not have the strength to bear you the whole way if therefor thou dost forget to throw down the nut he will let you both fall into the sea so our poor wander went forth and found all as the night wind had said and she pluck the eleventh rod and smote the dragon and the lion forthwith becam a princ and the dragon a princess again but no sooner was the princess releas from the spell than she seiz the princ by the arm and sprang on to the griffin back and went off carri the princ away with her thus the unhappi travel was again forsaken and forlorn but she took heart and said as far as the wind blow and so long as the cock crow i will journey on till i find him onc again she went on for a long long way till at length she came to the castl whither the princess had carri the princ and there was a feast got readi and she heard that the wed was about to be held heaven aid me now said she and she took the casket that the sun had given her and found that within it lay a dress as dazzl as the sun itself so she put it on and went into the palac and all the peopl gaze upon her and the dress pleas the bride so much that she ask whether it was to be sold not for gold and silver said she but for flesh and blood the princess ask what she meant and she said let me speak with the bridegroom this night in his chamber and i will give thee the dress at last the princess agre but she told her chamberlain to give the princ a sleep draught that he might not hear or see her when even came and the princ had fallen asleep she was led into his chamber and she sat herself down at his feet and said i have follow thee seven year i have been to the sun the moon and the night wind to seek thee and at last i have help thee to overcom the dragon wilt thou then forget me quit but the princ all the time slept so sound that her voic onli pass over him and seem like the whistl of the wind among the fir tree then poor lili was led away and forc to give up the golden dress and when she saw that there was no help for her she went out into a meadow and sat herself down and wept but as she sat she bethought herself of the egg that the moon had given her and when she broke it there ran out a hen and twelv chicken of pure gold that play about and then nestl under the old one wing so as to form the most beauti sight in the world and she rose up and drove them befor her till the bride saw them from her window and was so pleas that she came forth and ask her if she would sell the brood not for gold or silver but for flesh and blood let me again this even speak with the bridegroom in his chamber and i will give thee the whole brood then the princess thought to betray her as befor and agre to what she ask but when the princ went to his chamber he ask the chamberlain whi the wind had whistl so in the night and the chamberlain told him allhow he had given him a sleep draught and how a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber and was to come again that night then the princ took care to throw away the sleep draught and when lili came and began again to tell him what woe had befallen her and how faith and true to him she had been he knew his belov wife voic and sprang up and said you have awaken me as from a dream for the strang princess had thrown a spell around me so that i had altogeth forgotten you but heaven hath sent you to me in a lucki hour and they stole away out of the palac by night unawar and seat themselv on the griffin who flew back with them over the red sea when they were half way across lili let the nut fall into the water and immedi a larg nut tree aros from the sea whereon the griffin rest for a while and then carri them safe home there they found their child now grown up to be come and fair and after all their troubl they live happili togeth to the end of their day the fox and the hors a farmer had a hors that had been an excel faith servant to him but he was now grown too old to work so the farmer would give him noth more to eat and said i want you no longer so take yourself off out of my stabl i shall not take you back again until you are stronger than a lion then he open the door and turn him adrift the poor hors was veri melancholi and wander up and down in the wood seek some littl shelter from the cold wind and rain present a fox met him what the matter my friend said he whi do you hang down your head and look so lone and woe begon ah repli the hors justic and avaric never dwell in one hous my master has forgotten all that i have done for him so mani year and becaus i can no longer work he has turn me adrift and say unless i becom stronger than a lion he will not take me back again what chanc can i have of that he know i have none or he would not talk so howev the fox bid him be of good cheer and said i will help you lie down there stretch yourself out quit stiff and pretend to be dead the hors did as he was told and the fox went straight to the lion who live in a cave close by and said to him a littl way off lie a dead hors come with me and you may make an excel meal of his carcas the lion was great pleas and set off immedi and when they came to the hors the fox said you will not be abl to eat him comfort here ill tell you whati will tie you fast to his tail and then you can draw him to your den and eat him at your leisur this advic pleas the lion so he laid himself down quiet for the fox to make him fast to the hors but the fox manag to tie his leg togeth and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he could not set himself free when the work was done the fox clap the hors on the shoulder and said jip dobbin jip then up he sprang and move off drag the lion behind him the beast began to roar and bellow till all the bird of the wood flew away for fright but the hors let him sing on and made his way quiet over the field to his master hous here he is master said he i have got the better of him and when the farmer saw his old servant his heart relent and he said thou shalt stay in thi stabl and be well taken care of and so the poor old hors had plenti to eat and livedtil he die the blue light there was onc upon a time a soldier who for mani year had serv the king faith but when the war came to an end could serv no longer becaus of the mani wound which he had receiv the king

littl boy was so glad to see him that he crept behind him and laid fast hold of his leg and look up in his face and laugh then the father start trembl with fear and horror and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do but as no gold was come he made himself easi by think that it was onli a joke that the dwarf was play him and that at ani rate when the money came he should see the bearer and would not take it in about a month afterward he went upstair into a lumber room to look for some old iron that he might sell it and rais a littl money and there instead of his iron he saw a larg pile of gold lie on the floor at the sight of this he was overjoy and forget all about his son went into trade again and becam a richer merchant than befor meantim littl heinel grew up and as the end of the twelv year drew near the merchant began to call to mind his bond and becam veri sad and thought so that care and sorrow were written upon his face the boy one day ask what was the matter but his father would not tell for some time at last howev he said that he had without know it sold him for gold to a littl ugli look black dwarf and that the twelv year were come round when he must keep his

drew a circl on the ground and set himself and his father in the middl of it the littl black dwarf soon came and walk round and round about the circl but could not find ani way to get into it and he either could not or dare not jump over it at last the boy said to him have you anyth to say to us my friend or what do you want now heinel had found a friend in a good fairi that was fond of him and had told him what to do for this fairi knew what good luck was in store for him have you brought me what you said you would said the dwarf to the merchant the old man held his tongu but heinel said

step in here and let us talk it over the old man grin and show his teeth as if he should have been veri glad to get into the circl if he could then at last after a long talk they came to term heinel agre that his father must give him up and that so far the dwarf should have his way but on the other hand the fairi had told heinel what fortun was in store for him if he follow his own cours and he did not choos to be given up to his hump back friend who seem so anxious for his compani so to make a sort of drawn battl of the matter it was settl that heinel should be put into an open boat that lay on the sea shore hard by that the father should push him off with his own hand and that he should thus be set adrift and left to the bad or good luck of wind and weather then he took leav of his father and set himself in the boat but befor it got far off a wave struck it and it fell with one side low in the water so the merchant thought that poor heinel was lost and went home veri sorrow while the dwarf went his way think that at ani rate he had had his reveng the boat howev did not sink for the good fairi took care of her friend and soon rais the boat up again and it went safe on the
