sea there live a parse from whose hat the ray of the sun were reflect in more than orient splendour and the parse live by the red sea with noth but his hat and his knife and a cook stove of the kind that you must particular never touch and one day he took flour and water and currant and plum and sugar and thing and made himself one cake which was two feet across and three feet thick it was inde a superior comest that magic and he put it on stove becaus he was allow to cook on the stove and he bake it and he bake it till it was all done brown and smelt most sentiment but just as he was go to eat it there came down to the beach from the altogeth uninhabit interior one rhinocero with a horn on his nose two piggi eye and few manner in those day the rhinoceross skin fit him quit tight there were no wrinkl in it anywher he look exact like a noah ark rhinocero but of cours much bigger all the same he had no manner then and he has no manner now and he never will have ani manner he said how and the parse left that cake and climb to the top of a palm tree with noth on but his hat from which the ray of the sun were alway reflect in more than orient splendour and the rhinocero upset the oil stove with his nose and the cake roll on the sand and he spike that cake on the horn of his nose and he ate it and he went away wave his tail to the desol and exclus uninhabit interior which abut on

will now proceed to relat them that take cake which the parse man bake make dread mistak and there was a great deal more in that than you would think becaus five week later there was a heat wave in the red sea and everybodi took off all the cloth they had the parse took off his hat but the rhinocero took off his skin and carri it over his shoulder as he came down to the beach to bath in those day it button underneath with three button and look like a waterproof he said noth whatev about the parse cake becaus he had eaten it all and he never had ani manner then sinc or henceforward he waddl

three time round the skin and rub his hand then he went to his camp and fill his hat with cake crumb for the parse never ate anyth but cake and never swept out his camp he took that skin and he shook that skin and he scrub that skin and he rub that skin just as full of old dri stale tick cake crumb and some burn currant as ever it could possibl hold then he climb to the top of his palm tree and wait for the rhinocero to come out of the water and put it on and the rhinocero did he button it up with the three button and it tickl like cake crumb in bed then he want to scratch but that made it wors and then he lay down on the sand and roll and roll and roll and everi time he roll the cake crumb tickl him wors and wors and wors then he ran to the palm tree and rub and rub and rub himself against it he rub so much and so hard that he rub his skin into a great fold over his shoulder and anoth fold underneath where the button use to be but he rub the button off and he rub some more fold over his leg and it spoil his temper but it didnt make the least differ to the cake crumb they were insid his skin and they tickl so he went home veri angri inde and horribl scratchi and from that day

told him how to eat hedgehog and tortois she said to him ever so mani time gracious wave her tail my son when you find a hedgehog you must drop him into the water and then he will uncoil and when you

the cave till they were hungri and then teshumai tewindrow would say where in the world have you two been to to get so shock dirti realli my tegumai your no better than my taffi now attend and listen one day tegumai bopsulai went down through the beaver swamp to the wagai river to spear carp fish for dinner and taffi went too tegumai spear was made of wood with shark teeth at the end and befor he had caught ani fish at all he accident broke it clean across by jab it down too hard on the bottom of the river they were mile and mile from home of cours they had their lunch with them in a littl bag and tegumai had forgotten to bring ani extra spear here a pretti kettl of fish said tegumai it will take me half the day to mend this there your big black spear at home said taffi let me run back to the cave and ask mummi to give it me it too far for your littl fat leg said tegumai besid you might fall into the beaver swamp and be drown we must make the best of a bad job he sat down and took out a littl leather mendi bag full of reindeer sinew and strip of leather and lump of bee wax and resin and began to mend the spear taffi sat down too with her toe in the water and her chin in her hand and thought veri hard then she saidi say daddi it an aw nuisanc that you and i dont know how to write isnt it if we did we could send a messag for the new spear taffi said tegumai how often have i

tewara and he did not understand one word of tegumai languag he stood on the bank and smile at taffi becaus he had a littl girl daughter of his own at home tegumai drew a hank of deer sinew from his mendi bag and began to mend his spear come here said taffi do you know where my mummi live and the stranger man said um be as you know a tewara silli said taffi and she stamp her foot becaus she saw a
