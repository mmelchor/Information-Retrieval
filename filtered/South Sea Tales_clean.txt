mayb twenti year ago or twenti five there came a schooner right through the passag and into the lagoon it was a larg schooner with three mast she had five white men and mayb forti boat crew black fellow from new guinea and new britain and she had come to fish bech de mer she lay at anchor across the lagoon from here at pauloo and her boat scatter out everywher make camp on the beach where they cure the bech de mer this made them weak by divid them for those who fish here and those on the schooner at pauloo were fifti mile apart and there were other farther away still our king and headmen held council and i was one in the cano that paddl all afternoon and all night across the lagoon bring word to the peopl of pauloo that in the morn we would attack the fish camp at the one time and that it was for them to take the schooner we who brought the word were tire with the paddl but we took part in the attack on the schooner were two white men the skipper and the second mate with half a dozen black boy the skipper with three boy we caught on shore and kill but first eight of us the skipper kill with his two revolv we fought close togeth you see at hand grappl the nois of our fight told the mate what was happen and he put food and water and a sail in the small dingi which was so small that it was no more than twelv feet long we came down upon the schooner a thousand men cover the lagoon with our cano also we were blow conch shell sing war song and strike the side of the cano with our paddl what chanc had one white man and three black boy against us no chanc at all and the mate knew it white men are hell i have watch them much and i am an old man now and i understand at last whi the white men have taken to themselv all the island in the sea it is becaus they are hell here are you in the cano with me you are hard more than a boy you are not wise for each day i tell you mani thing you do not know when i was a littl pickaninni i knew more about fish and the way of fish than you know now i am an old man but i swim down to the bottom of the lagoon and you cannot follow me what are you good for anyway i do not know except to fight i have never seen you fight yet i know that you are like your brother and that you will fight like hell also you are a fool like your brother you do not know when you are beaten you will fight until you die and then it will be too late to know that you are beaten now behold what this mate did as we came down upon him cover the sea and blow our conch he put off from the schooner in the small boat along with the three black boy and row for the passag there again he was a fool for no wise man would put out to sea in so small a boat the side of it were not four inch abov the water twenti cano went after him fill with two hundr young men we paddl five fathom while his black boy were row one fathom he had no chanc but he was a fool he stood up in the boat with a rifl and he shot mani time he was not a good shot but as we drew close mani of us were wound and kill but still he had no chanc i rememb that all the time he was smoke a cigar when we were forti feet away and come fast he drop the rifl light a stick of dynamit with the cigar and threw it at us he light anoth and anoth and threw them at us veri rapid mani of them i know now that he must have split the end of the fuse and stuck in match head becaus they light so quick also the fuse were veri short sometim the dynamit stick went off in the air but most of them went off in the cano and each time they went off in a cano that cano was finish of the twenti cano the half were smash to piec the cano i was in was so smash and likewis the two men who sat next to me the dynamit fell between them the other cano turn and ran away then that mate yell yah yah yah at us also he went at us again with his rifl so that mani were kill through the back as they fled away and all the time the black boy in the boat went on row you see i told you true that mate was hell nor was that all befor he left the schooner he set her on fire and fix up all the powder and dynamit so that it would go off at one time there were hundr of us on board tri to put out the fire heav up water from oversid when the schooner blew up so that all we had fought for was lost to us besid mani more of us be kill sometim even now in my old age i have bad dream in which i hear that mate yell yah yah yah in a voic of thunder he yell yah yah yah but all those in the fish camp were kill the mate went out of the passag in his littl boat and that was the end of him we made sure for how could so small a boat with four men in it live on the ocean a month went by and then one morn between two rain squall a schooner sail in through our passag and drop anchor befor the villag the king and the headmen made big talk and it was agre that we would take the schooner in two or three day in the meantim as it was our custom alway to appear friend we went off to her in cano bring string of cocoanut fowl and pig to trade but when we were alongsid mani cano of us the men on board began to shoot us with rifl and as we paddl away i saw the mate who had gone to sea in the littl boat spring upon the rail and danc and yell yah yah yah that afternoon they land from the schooner in three small boat fill with white men they went right through the villag shoot everi man they saw also they shot the fowl and pig we who were not kill got away in cano and paddl out into the lagoon look back we could see all the hous on fire late in the afternoon we saw mani cano come from nihi which is the villag near the nihi passag in the northeast they were all that were left and like us their villag had been burn by a second schooner that had come through nihi passag we stood on in the dark to the westward for pauloo but in the middl of the night we heard women wail and then we ran into a big fleet of cano they were all that were left of pauloo which likewis was in ash for a third schooner had come in through the pauloo passag you see that mate with his black boy had not been drown he had made the solomon island and there told his brother of what we had done in oolong and all his brother had said they would come and punish us and there they were in the three schooner and our three villag were wipe out and what was there for us to do in the morn the two schooner from windward sail down upon us in the middl of the lagoon the trade wind was blow fresh and by score of cano they ran us down and the rifl never ceas talk we scatter like fli fish befor the bonita and there were so mani of us that we escap by thousand this way and that to the island on the rim of the atol and thereaft the schooner hunt us up and down the lagoon in the nighttim we slip past them but the next day or in two day or three day the schooner would be come back hunt us toward the other end of the lagoon and so it went we no longer count nor rememb our dead true we were mani and they were few but what could we do i was in one of the twenti cano fill with men who were not afraid to die we attack the smallest schooner they shot us down in heap they threw dynamit into the cano and when the dynamit gave out they threw hot water down upon us and the rifl never ceas talk and those whose cano were smash were shot as they swam away and the mate danc up and down upon the cabin top and yell yah yah yah everi hous on everi smallest island was burn not a pig nor a fowl was left aliv our well were defil with the bodi of the slain or els heap high with coral rock we were twenti five thousand on oolong befor the three schooner came today we are five thousand after the schooner left we were but three thousand as you shall see at last the three schooner grew tire of chase us back and forth so they went the three of them to nihi in the northeast and then they drove us steadili to the west their nine boat were in the water as well they beat up everi island as they move along they drove us drove us drove us day by day and everi night the three schooner and the nine boat made a chain of watch that stretch across the lagoon from rim to rim so that we could not escap back they could not drive us forev that way for the lagoon was onli so larg and at last all of us that yet live were driven upon the last sand bank to the west beyond lay the open sea there were ten thousand of us and we cover the sand bank from the lagoon edg to the pound surf on the other side no one could lie down there was no room we stood hip to hip and shoulder to shoulder two day they kept us there and the mate would climb up in the rig to mock us and yell yah yah yah till we were well sorri that we had ever harm him or his schooner a month befor we had no food and we stood on our feet two day and night the littl babi die and the old and weak die and the wound die and worst of all we had no water to quench our thirst and for two day the sun beat down on us and there was no shade mani men and women wade out into the ocean and were drown the surf cast their bodi back on the beach and there came a pest of fli some men swam to the side of the schooner but they were shot to the last one and we that live were veri sorri that in our pride we tri to take the schooner with the three mast that came to fish for bech de mer on the morn of the third day came the skipper of the three schooner and that mate in a small boat they carri rifl all of them and revolv and they made talk it was onli that they were weari of kill us that they had stop they told us and we told them that we were sorri that never again would we harm a white man and in token of our submiss we pour sand upon our head and all the women and children set up a great wail for water so that for some time no man could make himself heard then we were told our punish we must fill the three schooner with copra and bech de mer and we agre for we want water and our heart were broken and we knew that we were children at fight when we fought with white men who fight like hell and when all the talk was finish the mate stood up and mock us and yell yah yah yah after that we paddl away in our cano and sought water and for week we toil at catch bech de mer and cure it in gather the cocoanut and turn them into copra by day and night the smoke rose in cloud from all the beach of all the island of oolong as we paid the penalti of our wrongdo for in those day of death it was burn clear on all our brain that it was veri wrong to harm a white man by and by the schooner full of copra and bech de mer and our tree empti of cocoanut the three skipper and that mate call us all togeth for a big talk and they said they were veri glad that we had learn our lesson and we said for the ten thousandth time that we were sorri and that we would not do it again also we pour sand upon our head then the skipper said that it was all veri well but just to show us that they did not forget us they would send a devil devil that we would never forget and that we would alway rememb ani time we might feel like harm a white man after that the mate mock us one more time and yell yah yah yah then six of our men whom we thought long dead were put ashor from one of the schooner and the schooner hoist their sail and ran out through the passag for the solomon the six men who were put ashor were the first to catch the devil devil the skipper sent back after us a great sick came i interrupt for i recogn the trick the schooner had had measl on board and the six prison had been deliber expos to it yes a great sick oti went on it was a power devil devil the oldest man had never heard of the like those of our priest that yet live we kill becaus they could not overcom the devil devil the sick spread i have said that there were ten thousand of us that stood hip to hip and shoulder to shoulder on the sandbank when the sick left us there were three thousand yet aliv also have made all our cocoanut into copra there was a famin that fella trader oti conclud

oti the heathen i met him first in a hurrican and though we had gone through the hurrican on the same schooner it was not until the schooner had gone to piec under us that i first laid eye on him without doubt i had seen him with the rest of the kanaka crew on board but i had not conscious been awar of his exist for the petit jeann was rather overcrowd in addit to her eight or ten kanaka seamen her white captain mate and supercargo and her six cabin passeng she sail from rangiroa with someth like eighti five deck passengerspaumotan and tahitian men women and children each with a trade box to say noth of sleep mat blanket and cloth bundl the pearl season in the paumotus was over and all hand were return to tahiti the six of us cabin passeng were pearl buyer two were american one was ah choon the whitest chines i have ever known one was a german one was a polish jew and i complet the half dozen it had been a prosper season not one of us had caus for complaint nor one of the eighti five deck passeng either all had done well and all were look forward to a rest off and a good time in papeet of cours the petit jeann was overload she was onli seventi ton and she had no right to carri a tith of the mob she had on board beneath her hatch she was cram and jam with pearl shell and copra even the trade room was pack full with shell it was a miracl that the sailor could work her there was no move about the deck they simpli climb back and forth along the rail in the night time they walk upon the sleeper who carpet the deck ill swear two deep oh and there were pig and chicken on deck and sack of yam while everi conceiv place was festoon with string of drink cocoanut and bunch of banana on both side between the fore and main shroud guy had been stretch just low enough for the foreboom to swing clear and from each of these guy at least fifti bunch of banana were suspend it promis to be a messi passag even if we did make it in the two or three day that would have been requir if the southeast trade had been blow fresh but they werent blow fresh after the first five hour the trade die away in a dozen or so gasp fan the calm continu all that night and the next dayon of those glare glassi calm when the veri thought of open one eye to look at it is suffici to caus a headach the second day a man diedan easter island one of the best diver that season in the lagoon smallpoxthat is what it was though how smallpox could come on board when there had been no known case ashor when we left rangiroa is beyond me there it was thoughsmallpox a man dead and three other down on their back there was noth to be done we could not segreg the sick nor could we care for them we were pack like sardin there was noth to do but rot and diethat is there was noth to do after the night that follow the first death on that night the mate the supercargo the polish jew and four nativ diver sneak away in the larg whale boat they were never heard of again in the morn the captain prompt scuttl the remain boat and there we were that day there were two death the follow day three then it jump to eight it was curious to see how we took it the nativ for instanc fell into a condit of dumb stolid fear the captainoudous his name was a frenchmanbecam veri nervous and volubl he actual got the twitch he was a larg fleshi man weigh at least two hundr pound and he quick becam a faith represent of a quiver jelli mountain of fat the german the two american and myself bought up all the scotch whiskey and proceed to stay drunk the theori was beautifulnam if we kept ourselv soak in alcohol everi smallpox germ that came into contact with us would immedi be scorch to a cinder and the theori work though i must confess that neither captain oudous nor ah choon were attack by the diseas either the frenchman did not drink at all while ah choon restrict himself to one drink daili it was a pretti time the sun go into northern declin was straight overhead there was no wind except for frequent squall which blew fierc for from five minut to half an hour and wound up by delug us with rain after each squall the aw sun would come out draw cloud of steam from the soak deck the steam was not nice it was the vapor of death freight with million and million of germ we alway took anoth drink when we saw it go up from the dead and die and usual we took two or three more drink mix them except stiff also we made it a rule to take an addit sever each time they hove the dead over to the shark that swarm about us we had a week of it and then the whiskey gave out it is just as well or i shouldnt be aliv now it took a sober man to pull through what follow as you will agre when i mention the littl fact that onli two men did pull through the other man was the heathenat least that was what i heard captain oudous call him at the moment i first becam awar of the heathen exist but to come back it was at the end of the week with the whiskey gone and the pearl buyer sober that i happen to glanc at the baromet that hung in the cabin companionway it normal regist in the paumotus was 2990 and it was quit customari to see it vacil between 2985 and 3000 or even 3005 but to see it as i saw it down to 2962 was suffici to sober the most drunken pearl buyer that ever inciner smallpox microb in scotch whiskey i call captain oudous attent to it onli to be inform that he had watch it go down for sever hour there was littl to do but that littl he did veri well consid the circumst he took off the light sail shorten right down to storm canva spread life line and wait for the wind his mistak lay in what he did after the wind came he hove to on the port tack which was the right thing to do south of the equat ifand there was the rubif one were not in the direct path of the hurrican we were in the direct path i could see that by the steadi increas of the wind and the equal steadi fall of the baromet i want him to turn and run with the wind on the port quarter until the baromet ceas fall and then to heav to we argu till he was reduc to hysteria but budg he would not the worst of it was that i could not get the rest of the pearl buyer to back me up who was i anyway to know more about the sea and it way than a proper qualifi captain was what was in their mind i knew of cours the sea rose with the wind fright and i shall never forget the first three sea the petit jeann ship she had fallen off as vessel do at time when hove to and the first sea made a clean breach the life line were onli for the strong and well and littl good were they even for them when the women and children the banana and cocoanut the pig and trade box the sick and the die were swept along in a solid screech groan mass the second sea fill the petit jeann deck flush with the rail and as her stern sank down and her bow toss skyward all the miser dunnag of life and luggag pour aft it was a human torrent they came head first feet first sidewis roll over and over twist squirm writh and crumpl up now and again one caught a grip on a stanchion or a rope but the weight of the bodi behind tore such grip loos one man i notic fetch up head on and squar on with the starboard bitt his head crack like an egg i saw what was come sprang on top of the cabin and from there into the mainsail itself ah choon and one of the american tri to follow me but i was one jump ahead of them the american was swept away and over the stern like a piec of chaff ah choon caught a spoke of the wheel and swung in behind it but a strap raratonga vahin womansh must have weigh two hundr and fiftybrought up against him and got an arm around his neck he clutch the kanaka steersman with his other hand and just at that moment the schooner flung down to starboard the rush of bodi and sea that was come along the port runway between the cabin and the rail turn abrupt and pour to starboard away they wentvahin ah choon and steersman and i swear i saw ah choon grin at me with philosoph resign as he clear the rail and went under the third seath biggest of the threedid not do so much damag by the time it arriv near everybodi was in the rig on deck perhap a dozen gasp half drown and half stun wretch were roll about or attempt to crawl into safeti they went by the board as did the wreckag of the two remain boat the other pearl buyer and myself between sea manag to get about fifteen women and children into the cabin and batten down littl good it did the poor creatur in the end wind out of all my experi i could not have believ it possibl for the wind to blow as it did there is no describ it how can one describ a nightmar it was the same way with that wind it tore the cloth off our bodi i say tore them off and i mean it i am not ask you to believ it i am mere tell someth that i saw and felt there are time when i do not believ it myself i went through it and that is enough one could not face that wind and live it was a monstrous thing and the most monstrous thing about it was that it increas and continu to increas imagin countless million and billion of ton of sand imagin this sand tear along at nineti a hundr a hundr and twenti or ani other number of mile per hour imagin further this sand to be invis impalp yet to retain all the weight and densiti of sand do all this and you may get a vagu inkl of what that wind was like perhap sand is not the right comparison consid it mud invis impalp but heavi as mud nay it goe beyond that consid everi molecul of air to be a mudbank in itself then tri to imagin the multitudin impact of mudbank no it is beyond me languag may be adequ to express the ordinari condit of life but it cannot possibl express ani of the condit of so enorm a blast of wind it would have been better had i stuck by my origin intent of not attempt a descript i will say this much the sea which had risen at first was beaten down by that wind more it seem as if the whole ocean had been suck up in the maw of the hurrican and hurl on through that portion of space which previous had been occupi by the air of cours our canva had gone long befor but captain oudous had on the petit jeann someth i had never befor seen on a south sea schoonera sea anchor it was a conic canva bag the mouth of which was kept open by a huge loop of iron the sea anchor was bridl someth like a kite so that it bit into the water as a kite bite into the air but with a differ the sea anchor remain just under the surfac of the ocean in a perpendicular posit a long line in turn connect it with the schooner as a result the petit jeann rode bow on to the wind and to what sea there was the situat realli would have been favor had we not been in the path of the storm true the wind itself tore our canva out of the gasket jerk out our topmast and made a raffl of our run gear but still we would have come through nice had we not been squar in front of the advanc storm center that was what fix us i was in a state of stun numb paralyz collaps from endur the impact of the wind and i think i was just about readi to give up and die when the center smote us the blow we receiv was an absolut lull there was not a breath of air the effect on one was sicken rememb that for hour we had been at terrif muscular tension withstand the aw pressur of that wind and then sudden the pressur was remov i know that i felt as though i was about to expand to fli apart in all direct it seem as if everi atom compos my bodi was repel everi other atom and was on the verg of rush off irresist into space but that last onli for a moment destruct was upon us in the absenc of the wind and pressur the sea rose it jump it leap it soar straight toward the cloud rememb from everi point of the compass that inconceiv wind was blow in toward the center of calm the result was that the sea sprang up from everi point of the compass there was no wind to check them they pop up like cork releas from the bottom of a pail of water there was no system to them no stabil they were hollow maniac sea they were eighti feet high at the least they were not sea at all they resembl no sea a man had ever seen they were splash monstrous splashesthat is all splash that were eighti feet high eighti they were more than eighti they went over our masthead they were spout explos they were drunken they fell anywher anyhow they jostl one anoth they collid they rush togeth and collaps upon one anoth or fell apart like a thousand waterfal all at onc it was no ocean ani man had ever dream of that hurrican center it was confus thrice confound it was anarchi it was a hell pit of sea water gone mad the petit jeann i dont know the heathen told me afterward that he did not know she was liter torn apart rip wide open beaten into a pulp smash into kindl wood annihil when i came to i was in the water swim automat though i was about two third drown how i got there i had no recollect i rememb see the petit jeann fli to piec at what must have been the instant that my own conscious was buffet out of me but there i was with noth to do but make the best of it and in that best there was littl promis the wind was blow again the sea was much smaller and more regular and i knew that i had pass through the center fortun there were no shark about the hurrican had dissip the raven hord that had surround the death ship and fed off the dead it was about midday when the petit jeann went to piec and it must have been two hour afterward when i pick up with one of her hatch cover thick rain was drive at the time and it was the merest chanc that flung me and the hatch cover togeth a short length of line was trail from the rope handl and i knew that i was good for a day at least if the shark did not return three hour later possibl a littl longer stick close to the cover and with close eye concentr my whole soul upon the task of breath in enough air to keep me go and at the same time of avoid breath in enough water to drown me it seem to me that i heard voic the rain had ceas and wind and sea were eas marvel not twenti feet away from me on anoth hatch cover were captain oudous and the heathen they were fight over the possess of the coverat least the frenchman was paien noir i heard him scream and at the same time i saw him kick the kanaka now captain oudous had lost all his cloth except his shoe and they were heavi brogan it was a cruel blow for it caught the heathen on the mouth and the point of the chin half stun him i look for him to retali but he content himself with swim about forlorn a safe ten feet away whenev a fling of the sea threw him closer the frenchman hang on with his hand kick out at him with both feet also at the moment of deliv each kick he call the kanaka a black heathen for two centim id come over there and drown you you white beast i yell the onli reason i did not go was that i felt too tire the veri thought of the effort to swim over was nauseat so i call to the kanaka to come to me and proceed to share the hatch cover with him otoo he told me his name was pronounc o to o also he told me that he was a nativ of bora bora the most wester of the societi group as i learn afterward he had got the hatch cover first and after some time encount captain oudous had offer to share it with him and had been kick off for his pain and that was how otoo and i first came togeth he was no fighter he was all sweet and gentl a love creatur though he stood near six feet tall and was muscl like a gladiat he was no fighter but he was also no coward he had the heart of a lion and in the year that follow i have seen him run risk that i would never dream of take what i mean is that while he was no fighter and while he alway avoid precipit a row he never ran away from troubl when it start and it was ware shoal when onc otoo went into action i shall never forget what he did to bill king it occur in german samoa bill king was hail the champion heavyweight of the american navi he was a big brute of a man a verit gorilla one of those hard hit rough hous chap and clever with his fist as well he pick the quarrel and he kick otoo twice and struck him onc befor otoo felt it to be necessari to fight i dont think it last four minut at the end of which time bill king was the unhappi possessor of four broken rib a broken forearm and a disloc shoulder blade otoo knew noth of scientif box he was mere a manhandl and bill king was someth like three month in recov from the bit of manhandl he receiv that afternoon on apia beach but i am run ahead of my yarn we share the hatch cover between us we took turn and turn about one lie flat on the cover and rest while the other submerg to the neck mere held on with his hand for two day and night spell and spell on the cover and in the water we drift over the ocean toward the last i was deliri most of the time and there were time too when i heard otoo babbl and rave in his nativ tongu our continu immers prevent us from die of thirst though the sea water and the sunshin gave us the prettiest imagin combin of salt pickl and sunburn in the end otoo save my life for i came to lie on the beach twenti feet from the water shelter from the sun by a coupl of cocoanut leav no one but otoo could have drag me there and stuck up the leav for shade he was lie besid me i went off again and the next time i came round it was cool and starri night and otoo was press a drink cocoanut to my lip we were the sole survivor of the petit jeann captain oudous must have succumb to exhaust for sever day later his hatch cover drift ashor without him otoo and i live with the nativ of the atol for a week when we were rescu by the french cruiser and taken to tahiti in the meantim howev we had perform the ceremoni of exchang name in the south sea such a ceremoni bind two men closer togeth than blood brothership the initi had

we were lie at savo have run in to trade for curio now savo is aliv with shark the custom of the woolli head of buri their dead in the sea did not tend to discourag the shark from make the adjac water a hangout it was my luck to be come aboard in a tini overload nativ cano when the thing capsiz there were four woolli head and myself in it or rather hang to it the schooner was a hundr yard away i was just hail for a boat when one of the woolli head began to scream hold on to the end of the cano both he and that portion of the cano were drag under sever time then he loos his clutch and disappear a shark had got him the three remain nigger tri to climb out of the water upon the bottom of the cano i yell and curs and struck at the nearest with my fist but it was no use they were in a blind funk the cano could bare have support one of them under the three it upend and roll sidewis throw them back into the water i abandon the cano and start to swim toward the schooner expect to be pick up by the boat befor i got there one of the nigger elect to come with me and we swam along silent side by side now and again put our face into the water and peer about for shark the scream of the man who stay by the cano inform us that he was taken i was peer into the water when i saw a big shark pass direct beneath me he was fulli sixteen feet in length i saw the whole thing he got the woolli head by the middl and away he went the poor devil head shoulder and arm out of the water all the time screech in a heart rend way he was carri along in this fashion for sever hundr feet when he was drag beneath the surfac i swam dog on hope that that was the last unattach shark but there was anoth whether it was one that had attack the nativ earlier or whether it was one that had made a good meal elsewher i do not know at ani rate he was not in such hast as the other i could not swim so rapid now for a larg part of my effort was devot to keep track of him i was watch him when he made his first attack by good luck i got both hand on his nose and though his momentum near shove me under i manag to keep him off he veer clear and began circl about again a second time i escap him by the same manoeuvr the third rush was a miss on both side he sheer at the moment my hand should have land on his nose but his sandpap hide i had on a sleeveless undershirt scrape the skin off one arm from elbow to shoulder by this time i was play out and gave up hope the schooner was still two hundr feet away my face was in the water and i was watch him manoeuvr for anoth attempt when i saw a brown bodi pass between us it was otoo swim for the schooner master he said and he spoke gayli as though the affair was a mere lark i know shark the shark is my brother i obey swim slowli on while otoo swam about me keep alway between me and the shark foil his rush and encourag me the davit tackl carri away and they are rig the fall he explain a minut or so later and then went under to head off anoth attack by the time the schooner was thirti feet away i was about done for i could scarc move they were heav line at us from on board but they continu fell short the shark find that it was receiv no hurt had becom bolder sever time it near got me but each time otoo was there just the moment befor it was too late of cours otoo could have save himself ani time but he stuck by me good by charley im finish i just manag to gasp i knew that the end had come and that the next moment i should throw up my hand and go down but otoo laugh in my face say i will show you a new trick i will make that shark feel sick he drop in behind me where the shark was prepar to come at me a littl more to the left he next call out there is a line there on the water to the left masterto the left i chang my cours and struck out blind i was by that time bare conscious as my hand close on the line i heard an exclam from on board i turn and look there was no sign of otoo the next instant he broke surfac both hand were off at the wrist the stump spout blood otoo he call soft and i could see in his gaze the love that thrill in his voic then and then onli at the veri last of all our year he call me by that name good by otoo he call then he was drag under and i was haul aboard where i faint in the captain arm and so pass otoo who save me and made me a man and who save me in the end we met in the maw of a hurrican and part in the maw of a shark with seventeen interven year of comradeship the like of which i dare to assert has never befallen two men the one brown and the other white if jehovah be from his high place watch everi sparrow fall not least in his kingdom shall be otoo the one heathen of bora bora the terribl solomon there is no gainsay that the solomon are a hard bitten bunch of island on the other hand there are wors place in the world but to the new chum who has no constitut understand of men and life in the rough the solomon may inde prove terribl it is true that fever and dysenteri are perpetu on the walk about that loathsom skin diseas abound that the air is satur with a poison that bite into everi pore cut or abras and plant malign ulcer and that mani strong men who escap die there return as wreck to their own countri it is also true that the nativ of the solomon are a wild lot with a hearti appetit for human flesh and a fad for collect human head their highest instinct of sportsmanship is to catch a man with his back turn and to smite him a cun blow with a tomahawk that sever the spinal column at the base of the brain it is equal true that on some island such as malaita the profit and loss account of social intercours is calcul in homicid head are a medium of exchang and white head are extrem valuabl veri often a dozen villag make a jack pot which they fatten moon by moon against the time when some brave warrior present a white man head fresh and gori and claim the pot all the forego is quit true and yet there are white men who have live in the solomon a score of year and who feel homesick when they go away from them a man need onli to be carefuland luckyto live a long time in the solomon but he must also be of the right sort he must have the hallmark of the inevit white man stamp upon his soul he must be inevit he must have a certain grand careless of odd a certain coloss self satisfact and a racial egot that convinc him that one white is better than a thousand nigger everi day in the week and that on sunday he is abl to clean out two thousand nigger for such are the thing that have made the white man inevit oh and one other thingth white man who wish to be inevit must not mere despis the lesser breed and think a lot of himself he must also fail to be too long on imagin he must not understand too well the instinct custom and mental process of the black the yellow and the brown for it is not in such fashion that the white race has tramp it royal road around the world berti arkwright was not inevit he was too sensit too fine strung and he possess too much imagin the world was too much with him he project himself too quiver into his environ therefor the last place in the world for him to come was the solomon he did not come expect to stay a five week stop over between steamer he decid would satisfi the call of the primit he felt thrum the string of his be at least so he told the ladi tourist on the makembo

tourist on the outgo steamer and berti was again a hero while captain malu as usual pass unnot but captain malu sent back from sydney two case of the best scotch whiskey on the market for he was not abl to make up his mind as to whether it was captain hansen or mr harriwel who had given berti arkwright the more gorgeous insight into life in the solomon the inevit white man the black will never understand the white nor the white the black as long as black is black and white is white so said captain woodward we sat in the parlor of charley robert pub in apia drink long abu hame compound and share with us by the aforesaid charley robert who claim the recip direct from steven famous for have invent the abu hame at a time when he was spur on by nile thirstth steven who was respons for with kitchen to kartoun and who pass out at the sieg of ladysmith captain woodward short and squat elder burn by forti year of tropic sun and with the most beauti liquid brown eye i ever saw in a man spoke from a vast experi the crisscross of scar on his bald pate bespok a tomahawk intimaci with the black and of equal intimaci was the advertis front and rear on the right side of his neck where an arrow had at one time enter and been pull clean through as he explain he had been in a hurri on that occasionth arrow imped his runningand he felt that he could not take the time to break off the head and pull out the shaft the way it had come in at the present moment he was command of the savaii the big steamer that recruit labor from the westward for the german plantat on samoa half the troubl is the stupid of the white said robert paus to take a swig from his glass and to curs the samoan bar boy in affection term if the white man would lay himself out a bit to understand the work of the black man mind most of the mess would be avoid ive seen a few who claim they understood nigger captain woodward retort and i alway took notic that they were the first to be kai kaid eaten look at the missionari in new guinea and the new hebridesth martyr isl of erromanga and all the rest look at the austrian expedit that was cut to piec in the solomon in the bush of guadalcanar and look at the trader themselv with a score of year experi make their brag that no nigger would ever get them and whose head to this day are ornament the rafter of the cano hous there was old johnni simonstwenti six year on the raw edg of melanesia swore he knew the nigger like a book and that theyd never do for him and he pass out at marovo lagoon new georgia had his head saw off by a black mari woman and an old nigger with onli one leg have left the other leg in the mouth of a shark while dive for dynamit fish there was billi watt horribl reput as a nigger killer a man to scare the devil i rememb lie at cape littl new ireland you know when the nigger stole half a case of trade tobaccocost him about three dollar and a half in retali he turn out shot six nigger smash up their war cano and burn two villag and it was at cape littl four year afterward that he was jump along with fifti buku boy he had with him fish bech de mer in five minut they were all dead with the except of three boy who got away in a cano dont talk to me about understand the nigger the white man mission is to farm the world and it a big enough job cut out for him what time has he got left to understand nigger anyway just so said robert and somehow it doesnt seem necessari after all to understand the nigger in direct proport to the white man stupid is his success in farm the world and put the fear of god into the nigger heart captain woodward blurt out perhap your right robert perhap it his stupid that make him succeed and sure one phase of his stupid is his inabl to understand the nigger but there one thing sure the white has to run the nigger whether he understand them or not it inevit it fate and of cours the white man is inevitableit the nigger fate robert broke in tell the white man there pearl shell in some lagoon infest by ten thousand howl cannib and hell head there all by his lone with half a dozen kanaka diver and a tin alarm clock for chronomet all pack like sardin on a commodi five ton ketch whisper that there a gold strike at the north pole and that same inevit white skin creatur will set out at onc arm with pick and shovel a side of bacon and the latest patent rockerand what more hell get there tip it off to him that there diamond on the red hot rampart of hell and mr white man will storm the rampart and set old satan himself to pick and shovel work that what come of be stupid and inevit but i wonder what the black man must think of theth inevit i said captain woodward broke into quiet laughter his eye had a reminisc gleam im just wonder what the nigger of malu thought and still must be think of the one inevit white man we had on board when we visit them in the duchess he explain robert mix three more abu hame that was twenti year ago saxtorph was his name he was certain the most stupid man i ever saw but he was as inevit as death there was onli one thing that chap could do and that was shoot i rememb the first time i ran into himright here in apia twenti year ago that was befor your time robert i was sleep at dutch henri hotel down where the market is now ever heard of him he made a tidi stake smuggl arm in to the rebel sold out his hotel and was kill in sydney just six week afterward in a saloon row but saxtorph one night id just got to sleep when a coupl of cat began to sing in the courtyard it was out of bed and up window water jug in hand but just then i heard the window of the next room go up two shot were fire and the window was close i fail to impress you with the celer of the transact ten second at the outsid up went the window bang bang went the revolv and down went the window whoever it was he had never stop to see the effect of his shot he knew do you follow mehe knew there was no more cat concert and in the morn there lay the two offend stone dead it was marvel to me it still is marvel first it was starlight and saxtorph shot without draw a bead next he shot so rapid that the two report were like a doubl report and final he knew he had hit his mark without look to see two day afterward he came on board to see me i was mate then on the duchess a whack big one hundr and fifti ton schooner a blackbird and let me tell you that blackbird were blackbird in those day there werent ani govern protect for us either it was rough work give and take if we were finish and noth said and we ran nigger from everi south sea island they didnt kick us off from well saxtorph came on board john saxtorph was the name he gave he was a sandi littl man hair sandi complexion sandi and eye sandi too noth strike about him his soul was as neutral as his color scheme he said he was strap and want to ship on board would go cabin boy cook supercargo or common sailor didnt know anyth about ani of the billet but said that he was will to learn i didnt want him but his shoot had so impress me that i took him as common sailor wage three pound per month he was will to learn all right ill say that much but he was constitut unabl to learn anyth he could no more box the compass than i could mix drink like robert here and as for steer he gave me my first gray hair i never dare risk him at the wheel when we were run in a big sea while full and by and close and by were insolubl mysteri couldnt ever tell the differ between a sheet and a tackl simpli couldnt the fore throat jig and the jib jig were all one to him tell him to slack off the mainsheet and befor you know it hed drop the peak he fell overboard three time and he couldnt swim but he was alway cheer never seasick and he was the most will man i ever knew he was an uncommun soul never talk about himself his histori so far as we were concern began the day he sign on the duchess where he learn to shoot the star alon can tell he was a yankeethat much we knew from the twang in his speech and that was all we ever did know and now we begin to get to the point we had bad luck in the new hebrid onli fourteen boy for five week and we ran up befor the southeast for the solomon malaita then as now was good recruit ground and we ran into malu on the northwestern corner there a shore reef and an outer reef and a mighti nervous anchorag but we made it all right and fire off our dynamit as a signal to the nigger to come down and be recruit in three day we got not a boy the nigger came off to us in their cano by hundr but they onli laugh when we show them bead and calico and hatchet and talk of the delight of plantat work in samoa on the fourth day there came a chang fifti odd boy sign on and were billet in the main hold with the freedom of the deck of cours and of cours look back this wholesal sign on was suspici but at the time we thought some power chief had remov the ban against recruit the morn of the fifth day our two boat went ashor as usualon to cover the other you know in case of troubl and as usual the fifti nigger on board were on deck loaf talk smoke and sleep saxtorph and myself along with four other sailor were all that were left on board the two boat were man with gilbert island in the one were the captain the supercargo and the recruit in the other which was the cover boat and which lay off shore a hundr yard was the second mate both boat were well arm though troubl was littl expect four of the sailor includ saxtorph were scrape the poop rail the fifth sailor rifl in hand was stand guard by the water tank just forard of the mainmast i was forard put in the finish lick on a new jaw for the fore gaff i was just reach for my pipe where i had laid it down when i heard a shot from shore i straighten up to look someth struck me on the back of the head partial stun me and knock me to the deck my first thought was that someth had carri away aloft but even as i went down and befor i struck the deck i heard the devil own tattoo of rifl from the boat and twist sidewis i caught a glimps of the sailor who was stand guard two big nigger were hold his arm and a third nigger from behind was brain him with a tomahawk i can see it now the water tank the mainmast the gang hang on to him the hatchet descend on the back of his head and all under the blaze sunlight i was fascin by that grow vision of death the tomahawk seem to take a horribl long time to come down i saw it land and the man leg give under him as he crumpl the nigger held him up by sheer strength while he was hack a coupl of time more then i got two more hack on the head and decid that i was dead so did the brute that was hack me i was too helpless to move and i lay there and watch them remov the sentri head i must say they did it slick enough they were old hand at the busi the rifl fire from the boat had ceas and i made no doubt that they were finish off and that the end had come to everyth it was onli a matter of moment when they would return for my head they were evid take the head from the sailor aft head are valuabl on malaita especi white head they have the place of honor in the cano hous of the salt water nativ what particular decor effect the bushmen get out of them i didnt know but they prize them just as much as the salt water crowd i had a dim notion of escap and i crawl on hand and knee to the winch where i manag to drag myself to my feet from there i could look aft and see three head on top the cabinth head of three sailor i had given order to for month the nigger saw me stand and start for me i reach for my revolv and found they had taken it i cant say that i was scare ive been near to death sever time but it never seem easier than right then i was half stun and noth seem to matter the lead nigger had arm himself with a cleaver from the galley and he grimac like an ape as he prepar to slice me down but the slice was never made he went down on the deck all of a heap and i saw the blood gush from his mouth in a dim way i heard a rifl go off and continu to go off nigger after nigger went down my sens began to clear and i note that there was never a miss everi time that the rifl went off a nigger drop i sat down on deck besid the winch and look up perch in the crosstre was saxtorph how he had manag it i cant imagin for he had carri up with him two winchest and i dont know how mani bandoli of ammunit and he was now do the one onli thing in this world that he was fit to do ive seen shoot and slaughter but i never saw anyth like that i sat by the winch and watch the show i was weak and faint and it seem to be all a dream bang bang bang bang went his rifl and thud thud thud thud went the nigger to the deck it was amaz to see them go down after their first rush to get me when about a dozen had drop they seem paralyz but he never left off pump his gun by this time cano and the two boat arriv from shore arm with snider and with winchest which they had captur in the boat the fusillad they let loos on saxtorph was tremend luckili for him the nigger are onli good at close rang they are not use to put the gun to their shoulder they wait until they are right on top of a man and then they shoot from the hip when his rifl got too hot saxtorph chang off that had been his idea when he carri two rifl up with him the astound thing was the rapid of his fire also he never made a miss if ever anyth was inevit that man was it was the swift of it that made the slaughter so appal the nigger did not have time to think when they did manag to think they went over the side in a rush capsiz the cano of cours saxtorph never let up the water was cover with them and plump plump plump he drop his bullet into them not a singl miss and i could hear distinct the thud of everi bullet as it buri in human flesh the nigger spread out and head for the shore swim the water was carpet with bob head and i stood up as in a dream and watch it allth bob head and the head that ceas to bob some of the long shot were magnific onli one man reach the beach but as he stood up to wade ashor saxtorph got him it was beauti and when a coupl of nigger ran down to drag him out of the water saxtorph got them too i thought everyth was over then when i heard the rifl go off again a nigger had come out of the cabin companion on the run for the rail and gone down in the middl of it the cabin must have been full of them i count twenti they came up one at a time and jump for the rail but they never got there it remind me of trapshoot a black bodi would pop out of the companion bang would go saxtorph rifl and down would go the black bodi of cours those below did not know what was happen on deck so they continu to pop out until the last one was finish off saxtorph wait a while to make sure and then came down on deck he and i were all that were left of the duchesss complement and i was pretti well to the bad while he was helpless now that the shoot was over under my direct he wash out my scalp wound and sew them up a big drink of whiskey brace me to make an effort to get out there was noth els to do all the rest were dead we tri to get up sail saxtorph hoist and i hold the turn he was onc more the stupid lubber he couldnt hoist worth a cent and when i fell in a faint it look all up with us when i came to saxtorph was sit helpless on the rail wait to ask me what he should do i told him to overhaul the wound and see if there were ani abl to crawl he gather togeth six one i rememb had a broken leg but saxtorph said his arm were all right i lay in the shade brush the fli off and direct oper while saxtorph boss his hospit gang ill be bless if he didnt make those poor nigger heav at everi rope on the pin rail befor he found the halyard one of them let go the rope in the midst of the hoist and slip down to the deck dead but saxtorph hammer the other and made them stick by the job when the fore and main were up i told him to knock the shackl out of the anchor chain and let her go i had had myself help aft to the wheel where i was go to make a shift at steer i cant guess how he did it but instead of knock the shackl out down went the second anchor and there we were doubli moor in the end he manag to knock both shackl out and rais the staysail and jib and the duchess fill away for the entranc our deck were a spectacl dead and die nigger were everywher they were wedg away some of them in the most inconceiv place the cabin was full of them where they had crawl off the deck and cash in i put saxtorph and his graveyard gang to work heav them oversid and over they went the live and the dead the shark had fat pick that day of cours our four murder sailor went the same way their head howev we put in a sack with weight so that by no chanc should they drift on the beach and fall into the hand of the nigger our five prison i decid to use as crew but they decid otherwis they watch their opportun and went over the side saxtorph got two in mid air with his revolv and would have shot the other three in the water if i hadnt stop him i was sick of the slaughter you see and besid theyd help work the schooner out but it was merci thrown away for the shark got the three of them i had brain fever or someth after we got clear of the land anyway the duchess lay hove to for three week when i pull myself togeth and we jog on with her to sydney anyway those nigger of malu learn the everlast lesson that it is not good to monkey with a white man in their case saxtorph was certain inevit charley robert emit a long whistl and said well i should say so but whatev becam of saxtorph he drift into seal hunt and becam a crackerjack for six year he was high line of both the victoria and san francisco fleet the seventh year his schooner was seiz in bere sea by a russian cruiser and all hand so the talk went were slam into the siberian salt mine at least ive never heard of him sinc farm the world robert mutter farm the world well here to them somebodi got to do itfarm the world i mean captain woodward rub the criss cross on his bald head ive done my share of it he said forti year now this will be my last trip then im go home to stay ill wager the wine you dont robert challeng youll die in the har not at home captain woodward prompt accept the bet but person i think charley robert has the best of it the seed of mccoy the pyrene her iron side press low in the water by her cargo of wheat roll sluggish and made it easi for the man who was climb aboard from out a tini outrigg cano as his eye came level with the rail so that he could see inboard it seem to him that he saw a dim almost indiscern haze it was more like an illus like a blur film that had spread abrupt over his eye he felt an inclin to brush it away and the same instant he thought that he was grow old and that it was time to send to san francisco for a pair of spectacl as he came over the rail he cast a glanc aloft at the tall mast and next at the pump they were not work there seem noth the matter with the big ship and he wonder whi she had hoist the signal of distress he thought of his happi island and hope it was not diseas perhap the ship was short of water or provis he shook hand with the captain whose gaunt face and care worn eye made no secret of the troubl whatev it was at the same moment the newcom was awar of a faint indefin smell it seem like that of burnt bread but differ he glanc curious about him twenti feet away a weari face sailor was calk the deck as his eye linger on the man he saw sudden aris from under his hand a faint spiral of haze that curl and twist and was gone by now he had reach the deck his bare feet were pervad by a dull warmth that quick penetr the thick callus he knew now the natur of the ship distress his eye rove swift forward where the full crew of weari face sailor regard him eager the glanc from his liquid brown eye swept over them like a benedict sooth them rap them about as in the mantl of a great peac how long has she been afir captain he ask in a voic so gentl and unperturb that it was as the coo of a dove at first the captain felt the peac and content of it steal in upon him then the conscious of all that he had gone through and was go through smote him and he was resent by what right did this rag beachcomb in dungare trouser and a cotton shirt suggest such a thing as peac and content to him and his overwrought exhaust soul the captain did not reason this it was the unconsci process of emot that caus his resent fifteen day he answer short who are you my name is mccoy came the answer in tone that breath tender and compass i mean are you the pilot mccoy pass the benedict of his gaze over the tall heavi shoulder man with the haggard unshaven face who had join the captain i am as much a pilot as anybodi

who in hell are you he demand i am the chief magistr was the repli in a voic that was still the softest and gentlest imagin the tall heavi shoulder man broke out in a harsh laugh that was part amus but most hyster both he and the captain regard mccoy with incredul and amaz that this barefoot beachcomb should possess such high sound digniti was inconceiv his cotton shirt unbutton expos a grizzl chest and the fact that there was no undershirt beneath a worn straw hat fail to hide the rag gray hair halfway down his chest descend an untrim patriarch beard in ani slop shop two shill would have

from the lone rock of pitcairn to the crew cluster forward and wait anxious for the announc of a decis mccoy did not hurri he thought smooth and slowli step by step with the certitud of a mind that was never vex or outrag by life the wind is light now he said final there is a heavi current set to the westward that what made us fetch to leeward the captain interrupt desir to vindic his seamanship yes that is what fetch you to leeward mccoy went on well you cant work up against this current today and if you did there is no beach your ship will be a total loss he paus and captain and mate look

out of his bodi he look almost with apprehens about him this malign intern heat was astound it was a marvel that the cabin did not burst into flame he had a feel as if of be in a huge bake oven where the heat might at ani moment increas tremend and shrivel him up like a blade of grass as he lift one foot and rub the hot sole against the leg of his trouser the mate laugh in a savag snarl fashion the anteroom of hell he said hell herself is right down there under your feet it hot mccoy cri involuntarili mop his face with a bandana handkerchief here mangareva the captain said bend over the tabl and point to a black speck in the midst of the white blank of the chart and here in between is anoth island whi not run for that mccoy did not look at the chart that crescent island he answer it is uninhabit and it is onli two or three feet abov water lagoon but no entranc no mangareva is the nearest place for your purpos mangareva it is then said captain davenport interrupt the mate growl object call the crew aft mr konig the sailor obey shuffl wearili along the deck and pain endeavor to make hast exhaust was evid in everi movement the cook came out of his galley to hear and the cabin boy hung about near him when captain davenport had explain the situat and announc his intent of run for mangareva an uproar broke out against a background of throati rumbl aros inarticul cri of rage with here and there a distinct curs or word or phrase a shrill cockney voic soar and domin for a moment cri gawd after bein in ell for fifteen daysan now e want us to sail this floatin ell to sea again the captain could not control them but mccoy gentl presenc seem to rebuk and calm them and the mutter and curs die away until the full crew save here and there an anxious face direct at the captain yearn dumbl toward the green clad peak and beetl coast of pitcairn soft as a spring zephyr was the voic of mccoy captain i thought i heard some of them say they were starv ay was the answer and so we are ive had a sea biscuit and a spoon of salmon in the last two day were on whack you see when we discov the fire we batten down immedi to suffoc the fire and then we found how littl food

convuls and anim like with rage the second and third mate had join the captain stand behind him at the break of the poop their face were set and expressionless they seem bore more than anyth els by this mutini of the crew captain davenport glanc question at his first mate and that person mere shrug his shoulder in token of his helpless you see the captain said to mccoy you cant compel sailor to leav the safe land and go to sea on a burn vessel she has been their float coffin for over two week now they are work out and starv out and theyv got enough of her well beat up for pitcairn but the wind was light the pyrene bottom was foul and she could not beat up against the strong wester current at the end of two hour she had lost three mile the sailor work eager as if by main strength they could compel the pyrene against the advers element but steadili port tack and starboard tack she sag off to the westward the captain pace restless up and down paus occasion to survey the vagrant smoke wisp and to trace them back to the portion of the deck from which they sprang the carpent was engag constant in attempt to locat such place and when he succeed in calk them tighter and tighter well what do you think the captain final ask mccoy who was watch the carpent with all a child interest and curios in his eye mccoy look shoreward where the land was disappear in the thicken haze i think it would be better to squar away for mangareva with that breez that is come youll be there tomorrow even but what if the fire break out it is liabl to do it ani moment have your boat readi in the fall the same breez will carri your boat to mangareva if the ship burn out from under captain davenport debat for a moment and then mccoy heard the question he had not want to hear but which he knew was

seren was unbroken yes captain he said with the same quiet unconcern with which he would have accept an invit to dinner ill go with you to mangareva again the crew was call aft and the captain spoke to them from the break of the poop weve tri to work her up but you see how weve lost ground shes set off in a two knot current this gentleman is the honor mccoy chief magistr and governor of pitcairn island he will come along with us to mangareva so you see the situat is not so danger he would not make such an offer if he thought he was go to lose his life besid whatev risk there is if he of his own free will come on board and take it we can do no less what do you say for mangareva this time there was no uproar mccoy presenc the sureti and calm that seem to radiat from him had had it effect they confer with one anoth in low voic there was littl urg they were virtual unanim and they shove the cockney out as their spokesman that worthi was overwhelm with conscious of the heroism of himself and his mate and with flash eye he cri by gawd if e will we will the crew mumbl it assent and start forward one moment captain mccoy said as the other was turn to give order to the mate i must go

of dri banana each packag wrap in dri leav now captain he said swing the yard and drive for dear life you see i am no navig he explain a few minut later as he stood by the captain aft the latter with gaze wander from aloft to oversid as he estim the pyrene speed you must fetch her to mangareva when you have pick up the land then i will pilot her in what do you think she is make eleven captain davenport answer with a final glanc at the water rush past eleven let me see if she keep up that gait well sight mangareva between eight and nine oclock tomorrow morn ill have her on the beach by ten or by eleven at latest and then your troubl will be all over it almost seem to the captain that the bliss moment had alreadi arriv such was the persuas convincing of mccoy captain davenport had been under the fear strain of navig his burn ship for over two week and he was begin to feel that he had had enough a heavier flaw of wind struck the back of his neck and whistl by his ear he measur the weight of it and look quick oversid the wind is make all the time he announc the old girl do nearer twelv than eleven right now if this keep up well be shorten down tonight all day the pyrene carri her load of live fire tore across the foam sea by nightfal royal and topgallantsail were in and she flew on into the dark with great crest sea roar after her the auspici wind had had it effect and fore and aft a visibl brighten was appar in the second dog watch some careless soul start a song and by eight bell the whole crew was sing captain davenport had his blanket brought up and spread on top the hous ive forgotten what sleep is he explain to mccoy im all in but give me a call at ani time you think necessari at three in the morn he was arous by a gentl tug at his arm he sat up quick brace himself against the skylight stupid yet from his heavi sleep the wind was thrum it war song in the rig and a wild sea was buffet the pyrene amidship she was wallow first one rail under and then the other flood the waist more often than not mccoy was shout someth he could not hear he reach out clutch the other by the shoulder and drew him close so that his own ear was close to the other lip it three oclock came mccoy voic still retain it dovelik qualiti but curious muffl as if from a long way off weve run two hundr and fifti crescent island is onli thirti mile away somewher there dead ahead there no light on it if we keep run well pile up and lose ourselv as well as the ship what d ye thinkheav to yes heav to till daylight it will onli put us back four hour so the pyrene with her cargo of fire was hove to bit the teeth of the gale and fight and smash the pound sea she was a shell fill with a conflagr and on the outsid of the shell cling precari the littl mote of men by pull and haul help her in the battl it is most unusu this gale mccoy told the captain in the lee of the cabin by right there should be no gale at this time of the year but everyth about the weather has been unusu there has been a stoppag of the trade and now it howl right out of the trade quarter he wave his hand into the dark as if his vision could dim penetr for hundr of mile it is off to the westward there is someth big make off there somewherea hurrican or someth were lucki to be so far to the eastward but this is onli a littl blow he ad it cant last i can tell you that much by daylight the gale had eas down to normal but daylight reveal a new danger it had come on thick the sea was cover by a fog or rather by a pear mist that was fog like in densiti in so far as it obstruct vision but that was no more than a film on the sea for the sun shot it through and fill it with a glow radianc the deck of the pyrene was make more smoke than on the preced day and the cheer of offic and crew had vanish in the lee of the galley the cabin boy could be heard whimper it was his first voyag and the fear of death was at his heart the captain wander about like a lost soul nervous chew his mustach scowl unabl to make up his mind what to do what do you think he ask paus by the side of mccoy who was make a breakfast off fri banana and a mug of water mccoy finish the last banana drain the mug and look slowli around in his eye was a smile of tender as he said well captain we might as well drive as burn your deck are not go to hold out forev they are hotter this morn you havent a pair of shoe i can wear it is get uncomfort for my bare feet the pyrene ship two heavi sea as she was swung off and put onc more befor it and the first mate express a desir to have all that water down in the hold if onli it could be introduc without take off the hatch mccoy duck his head into the binnacl and watch the cours set id hold her up some more captain he said shes been make drift when hove to ive set it to a point higher alreadi was the answer isnt that enough id make it two point captain this bit of a blow kick that wester current ahead faster than you imagin captain davenport compromis on a point and a half and then went aloft accompani by mccoy and the first mate to keep a lookout for land sail had been made so that the pyrene was do ten knot the follow sea was die down rapid there was no break in the pear fog and by ten oclock captain davenport was grow nervous all hand were at their station readi at the first warn of land ahead to spring like fiend to the task of bring the pyrene up on the wind that land ahead a surf wash outer reef would be peril close when it reveal itself in such a fog anoth hour pass the three watcher aloft stare intent into the pear radianc what if we miss mangareva captain davenport ask abrupt mccoy without shift his gaze answer soft whi let her drive captain that is all we can do all the paumotus are befor us we can drive for a thousand mile through reef and atol we are bound to fetch up somewher then drive it is captain davenport evidenc his intent of descend to the deck weve miss mangareva god know where the next land is i wish id held her up that other half point he confess a moment later this curs current play the devil with a navig the old navig call the paumotus the danger archipelago mccoy said when they had regain the poop this veri current was part respons for that name i was talk with a sailor chap in sydney onc said mr konig hed been trade in the paumotus he told me insur was eighteen per cent is that right mccoy smile and nod except that they dont insur he explain the owner write off twenti per cent of the cost of their schooner each year my god captain davenport groan that make the life of a schooner onli five year he shook his head sad murmur bad water bad water again they went into the cabin to consult the big general chart but the poison vapor drove them cough and gasp on deck here is moerenhout island captain davenport point it out on the chart which he had spread on the hous it cant be more than a hundr mile to leeward a hundr and ten mccoy shook his head doubt it might be done but it is veri difficult i might beach her and then again i might put her on the reef a bad place a veri bad place well take the chanc was captain davenport decis as he set about work out the cours sail was shorten earli in the afternoon to avoid run past in the night and in the second dog watch the crew manifest it regain cheer land was so veri near and their troubl would be over in the morn but morn broke clear with a blaze tropic sun the southeast trade had swung around to the eastward and was drive the pyrene through the water at an eight knot clip captain davenport work up his dead reckon allow generous for drift and announc moerenhout island to be not more than ten mile off the pyrene sail the ten mile she sail ten mile more and the lookout at the three masthead saw naught but the nake sun wash sea but the land is there i tell you captain davenport shout to them from the poop mccoy smile sooth but the captain glare about him like a madman fetch his sextant and took a chronomet sight i knew i was right he almost shout when he had work up the observ twenti one fifti five south one thirti six two west there you are were eight mile to windward yet what did you make it out mr konig the first mate glanc at his own figur and said in a low voic twenti one fifti five all right but my longitud one thirti six forti eight that put us consider to leeward but captain davenport ignor his figur with so contemptu a silenc as to make mr konig grit his teeth and curs savag under his breath keep her off the captain order the man at the wheel three pointssteadi there as she goe then he return to his figur and work them over the sweat pour from his face he chew his mustach his lip and his pencil stare at the figur as a man might at a ghost sudden with a fierc muscular outburst he crumpl the scribbl paper in his fist and crush it under foot mr konig grin vindict and turn away while captain davenport lean against the cabin and for half an hour spoke no word content himself with gaze to leeward with an express of muse hopeless on his face mr mccoy he broke silenc abrupt the chart indic a group of island but not how mani off there to the northard or nor norwestward about forti milesth acteon island what about them there are four all low mccoy answer first to the southeast is matueruino peopl no entranc to the lagoon then come tenarunga there use to

low there is no bed for the pyrene in that group she would be a total wreck listen to that captain davenport was frantic no peopl no entranc what in the devil are island good for well then he bark sudden like an excit terrier the chart give a whole mess of island off to the norwest what about them what one has an entranc where i can lay my ship mccoy calm consid he did not refer to the chart all these island reef shoal lagoon entranc and distanc were mark on the chart of his memori he knew them as the citi dweller know his build street and alley papakena and vanavana are off there to the westward or west norwestward a hundr mile and a bit more he said one is uninhabit and i heard that the peopl on the other had gone off to cadmus island anyway neither lagoon has an entranc ahunui is anoth hundr mile on to the norwest no entranc no peopl well forti mile beyond them are two island captain davenport queri rais his head from the chart mccoy shook his head paro and manuhungino entranc no peopl nengo nengo is forti mile beyond them in turn and it has no peopl and no entranc but there is hao island it is just the place the lagoon is thirti mile long and five mile wide there are plenti of peopl you can usual find water and ani ship in the world can go through the entranc he ceas and gaze solicit at captain davenport who bend over the chart with a pair of divid in hand had just emit a low groan is there ani lagoon with an entranc anywher nearer than hao island he ask no captain that is the nearest well it three hundr and forti mile captain davenport was speak veri slowli with decis i wont risk the respons of all these live ill wreck her on the acteon and shes a good ship too he ad regret after alter the cours this time make more allow than ever for the wester current an hour later the sky was overcast the southeast trade still held but the ocean was a checker board of squall well be there by one oclock captain davenport announc confid by two oclock at the outsid mccoy you put her ashor on the one where the peopl are the sun did not appear again nor at one oclock was ani land to be seen captain davenport look astern at the pyrene cant wake good lord he cri an easter current look at that mr konig was incredul mccoy was noncommitt though he said that in the paumotus there was no reason whi it should not be an easter current a few minut later a squall rob the pyrene temporarili of all her wind and she was left roll heavili in the trough where that deep lead over with it you there captain davenport held the lead line and watch it sag off to the northeast there look at that take hold of it for yourself mccoy and the mate tri it and felt the line thrum and vibrat savag to the grip of the tidal stream a four knot current said mr konig an easter current instead of a wester said captain davenport glare accus at mccoy as if to cast the blame for it upon him that is one of the reason captain for insur be eighteen per cent in these water mccoy answer cheer you can never tell the current are alway chang there was a man who wrote book i forget his name in the yacht casco he miss takaroa by thirti mile and fetch tikei all becaus of the shift current you are up to windward now and youd better keep off a few point but how much has this current set me the captain demand irat how am i to know how much to keep off i dont know captain mccoy said with great gentl the wind return and the pyrene her deck smoke and shimmer in the bright gray light ran off dead to leeward then she work back port tack and starboard tack crisscross her track comb the sea for the acteon island which the masthead lookout fail to sight captain davenport was besid himself his rage took the form of sullen silenc and he spent the afternoon in pace the poop or lean against the weather shroud at nightfal without even consult mccoy he squar away and head into the northwest mr konig surreptiti consult chart and binnacl and mccoy open and innoc consult the binnacl knew that they were run for hao island by midnight the squall ceas and the star came out captain davenport was cheer by the promis of a clear day ill get an observ in the morn he told mccoy though what my latitud is is a puzzler but ill use the sumner method and settl that do you know the sumner line and thereupon he explain it in detail to mccoy the day prove clear the trade blew steadili out of the east and the pyrene just as steadili log her nine knot both the captain and mate work out the posit on a sumner line and agre and at noon agre again and verifi the morn sight by the noon sight anoth twenti four hour and well be there captain davenport assur mccoy it a miracl the way the old girl deck hold out but they cant last they cant last look at them smoke more and more everi day yet it was a tight deck to begin with fresh calk in frisco i was surpris when the fire first broke out and we batten down look at that he broke off to gaze with drop jaw at a spiral of smoke that coil and twist in the lee of the mizzenmast twenti feet abov the deck now how did that get there he demand indign beneath it there was no smoke crawl up from the deck shelter from the wind by the mast by some freak it took form and visibl at that height it writh away from the mast and for a moment overhung the captain like some threaten portent the next moment the wind whisk it away and the captain jaw return to place as i was say when we first batten down i was surpris it was a tight deck yet it leak smoke like a siev and weve calk and calk ever sinc there must be tremend pressur underneath to drive so much smoke through that afternoon the sky becam overcast again and squalli drizzli weather set in the wind shift back and forth between southeast and northeast and at midnight the pyrene was caught aback by a sharp squall from the southwest from which point the wind continu to blow intermitt we wont make hao until ten or eleven captain davenport complain at seven in the morn when the fleet promis of the sun had been eras by hazi cloud mass in the eastern sky and the next moment he was plaintiv demand and what are the current do lookout at the masthead could report no land and the day pass in drizzl calm and violent squall by nightfal a heavi sea began to make from the west the baromet had fallen to 2950 there was no wind and still the omin sea continu to increas soon the pyrene was roll mad in the huge wave that march in an unend process from out of the dark of the west sail was shorten as fast as both watch could work and when the tire crew had finish it grumbl and complain voic peculiar anim like and menac could be heard in the dark onc the starboard watch was call aft to lash down and make secur and the men open advertis their sullen and unwilling everi slow movement was a protest and a threat the atmospher was moist and sticki like mucilag and in the absenc of wind all hand seem to pant and gasp for air the sweat stood out on face and bare arm and captain davenport for one his face more gaunt and care worn than ever and his eye troubl and stare was oppress by a feel of impend calam it off to the westward mccoy said encourag at worst well be onli on the edg of it but captain davenport refus to be comfort and by the light of a lantern read up the chapter in his epitom that relat to the strategi of shipmast in cyclon storm from somewher amidship the silenc was broken by a low whimper from the cabin boy oh shut up captain davenport yell sudden and with such forc as to startl everi man on board and to frighten the offend into a wild wail of terror mr konig the captain said in a voic that trembl with rage and nerv will you kind step forard and stop that brat mouth with a deck mop but it was mccoy who went forward and in a few minut had the boy comfort and asleep short befor daybreak the first breath of air began to move from out the southeast increas swift to a stiff and stiffer breez all hand were on deck wait for what might be behind it were all right now captain said mccoy stand close to his shoulder the hurrican is to the westard and we are south of it this breez is the in suck it wont blow ani harder you can begin to put sail on her but what the good where shall i sail this is the second day without observ and we should have sight hao island yesterday morn which way doe it bear north south east or what tell me that and ill make sail in a jiffi i am no navig captain mccoy said in his mild way i use to think i was one was the retort befor i got into these paumotus at midday the cri of breaker ahead was heard from the lookout the pyrene was kept off and sail after sail was loos and sheet home the pyrene was slide through the water and fight a current that threaten to set her down upon the breaker offic and men were work like mad cook and cabin boy captain davenport himself and mccoy all lend a hand it was a close shave it was a low shoal a bleak and peril place over which the sea broke unceas where no man could live and on which not even sea bird could rest the pyrene was swept within a hundr yard of it befor the wind carri her clear and at this moment the pant crew it work done burst out in a torrent of curs upon the head of mccoyof mccoy who had come on board and propos the run to mangareva and lure them all away from the safeti of pitcairn island to certain destruct in this baffl and terribl stretch of sea but mccoy tranquil soul was undisturb he smile at them with simpl and gracious benevol and somehow the exalt good of him seem to penetr to their dark and somber soul shame them and from veri shame still the curs vibrat in their throat bad water bad water captain davenport was murmur as his ship forg clear but he broke off abrupt to gaze at the shoal which should have been dead astern but which was alreadi on the pyrene weather quarter and work up rapid to windward he sat down and buri his face in his hand and the first mate saw and mccoy saw and the crew saw what he had seen south of the shoal an easter current had set them down upon it north of the shoal an equal swift wester current had clutch the ship and was sweep her away ive heard of these paumotus befor the captain groan lift his blanch face from his hand captain moyendal told me about them after lose his ship on them and i laugh at him behind his back god forgiv me i laugh at him what shoal is that he broke off to ask mccoy i dont know captain whi dont you know becaus i never saw it befor and becaus i have never heard of it i do know that it is not chart these water have never been thorough survey then you dont know where we are no more than you do mccoy said gentl at four in the afternoon cocoanut tree were sight appar grow out of the water a littl later the low land of an atol was rais abov the sea i know where we are now captain mccoy lower the glass from his eye that resolut island we are forti mile beyond hao island and the wind is in our teeth get readi to beach her then where the entranc there onli a cano passag but now that we know where we are we can run for barclay de tolley it is onli one hundr and twenti mile from here due nor norwest with this breez we can be there by nine oclock tomorrow morn captain davenport consult the chart and debat with himself if we wreck her here mccoy ad wed have to make the run to barclay de tolley in the boat just the same the captain gave his order and onc more the pyrene swung off for anoth run across the inhospit sea and the middl of the next afternoon saw despair and mutini on her smoke deck the current had acceler the wind had slacken and the pyrene had sag off to the west the lookout sight barclay de tolley to the eastward bare visibl from the masthead and vain and for hour the pyrene tri to beat up to it ever like a mirag the cocoanut tree hover on the horizon visibl onli from the masthead from the deck they were hidden by the bulg of the world again captain davenport consult mccoy and the chart makemo lay seventi five mile to the southwest it lagoon was thirti mile long and it entranc was excel when captain davenport gave his order the crew refus duti they announc that they had had enough of hell fire under their feet there was the land what if the ship could not make it they could make it in the boat let her burn then their live amount to someth to them they had serv faith the ship now they were go to serv themselv they sprang to the boat brush the second and third mate out of the way and proceed to swing the boat out and to prepar to lower away captain davenport and the first mate revolv in hand were advanc to the break of the poop when mccoy who had climb on top of the cabin began to speak he spoke to the sailor and at the first sound of his dovelik coo voic they paus to hear he extend to them his own ineff seren and peac his soft voic and simpl thought flow out to them in a magic stream sooth them against their will long forgotten thing came back to them and some rememb lullabi song of childhood and the content and rest of the mother arm at the end of the day there was no more troubl no more danger no more irk in all the world everyth was as it should be and it was onli a matter of cours that they should turn their back upon the land and put to sea onc more with hell fire hot beneath their feet mccoy spoke simpli but it was not what he spoke it was his person that spoke more eloqu than ani word he could utter it was an alchemi of soul occult subtil and profound deepa mysteri eman of the spirit seduct sweet humbl and terribl imperi it was illumin in the dark crypt of their soul a compuls of puriti and gentl vast greater than that which resid in the shine death spit revolv of the offic the men waver reluct where they stood and those who had loos the turn made them fast again then one and then anoth and then all of them began to sidl awkward away mccoy face was beam with childlik pleasur as he descend from the top of the cabin there was no troubl for that matter there had been no troubl avert there never had been ani troubl for there was no place for such in the bliss world in which he live you hypnot em mr konig grin at him speak in a low voic those boy are good was the answer their heart are good they have had a hard time and they have work hard and they will work hard to the end mr konig had not time to repli his voic was ring out order the sailor were spring to obey and the pyrene was pay slowli off from the wind until her bow should point in the direct of makemo the wind was veri light and after sundown almost ceas it was insuffer warm and fore and aft men sought vain to sleep the deck was too hot to lie upon and poison vapor ooz through the seam crept like evil spirit over the ship steal into the nostril and windpip of the unwari and caus fit of sneez and cough the star blink lazili in the dim vault overhead and the full moon rise in the east touch with it light the myriad of wisp and thread and spideri film of smoke that intertwin and writh and twist along the deck over the rail and up the mast and shroud tell me captain davenport said rub his smart eye what happen with that bounti crowd after they reach pitcairn the account i read said they burnt the bounti and that they were not discov until mani year later but what happen in the meantim ive alway been curious to know they were men with their neck in the
