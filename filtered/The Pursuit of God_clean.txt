univers dark one cheer gleam appear within the fold of conserv christian there are to be found increas number of person whose religi live are mark by a grow hunger after god himself they are eager for spiritu realiti and will not be put off with word nor will they be content with correct interpret of truth they are athirst for god and they will not be satisfi till they have drunk deep at the fountain of live water this is the onli real harbing of reviv which i have been abl to detect anywher on the religi horizon it may be the cloud the size of a man hand for which a few saint here and there have been look it can result in a resurrect of life for mani soul and a recaptur of that radiant wonder which should accompani faith in christ that wonder which has all but fled the church of god in our day but this hunger must be recogn by our religi leader current evangel has to chang the figur laid the altar and divid the sacrific into part but now seem satisfi to count the stone and rearrang the piec with never a care that there is not a sign of fire upon the top of lofti carmel but god be thank that there are a few who care they are those who while they love the altar and delight in the sacrific are yet unabl to reconcil themselv to the continu absenc of fire they desir god abov all they are athirst to tast for themselv the pierc sweet of the love of christ about whom all the holi prophet did write and the psalmist did sing there is today no lack of bibl teacher to set forth correct the principl of the doctrin of christ but too mani of these seem satisfi to teach the fundament of the faith year after year strang unawar that there is in their ministri no manifest presenc nor anyth unusu in their person live they minist constant to believ who feel within their breast a long which their teach simpli doe not satisfi i trust i speak in chariti but the lack in our pulpit is real milton terribl sentenc appli to our day as accur as it did to his the hungri sheep look up and are not fed it is a solemn thing and no small scandal in the kingdom to see god children starv while actual seat at the father tabl the truth of wesley word is establish befor our eye orthodoxi or right opinion is at best a veri slender part of religion though right temper cannot subsist without right opinion yet right opinion may subsist without right temper there may be a right opinion of god without either love or one right temper toward him satan is a proof of this thank to our splendid bibl societi and to other effect agenc for the dissemin of the word there are today mani million of peopl who hold right opinion probabl more than ever befor in the histori of the church yet i wonder if there was ever a time when true spiritu worship was at a lower ebb to great section of the church the art of worship has been lost entir and in it place has come that strang and foreign thing call the program this word has been borrow from the stage and appli with sad wisdom to the type of public servic which now pass for worship among us sound bibl exposit is an imper must in the church of the live god without it no church can be a new testament church in ani strict mean of that term but exposit may be carri on in such way as to leav the hearer devoid of ani true spiritu nourish whatev for it is not mere word that nourish the soul but god himself and unless and until the hearer find god in person experi they are not the better for have heard the truth the bibl is not an end in itself but a mean to bring men to an intim and satisfi knowledg of god that they may enter into him that they may delight in his presenc may tast and know the inner sweet of the veri god himself in the core and center of their heart this book is a modest attempt to aid god hungri children so to find him noth here is new except in the sens that it is a discoveri which my own heart has made of spiritu realiti most delight and wonder to me other befor me have gone much farther into these holi mysteri than i have done but if my fire is not larg it is yet real and there may be those who can light their candl at it flame a w tozer chicago ill june 16 1948 i follow hard after god my soul followeth hard after thee thi right hand upholdeth mepsa 638 christian theolog teach the doctrin of preveni grace which briefli state mean this that befor a man can seek god god must first have sought the man befor a sin man can think a right thought of god there must have been a work of enlighten done within him imperfect it may be but a true work nonetheless and the secret caus of all desir and seek and pray which may follow we pursu god becaus and onli becaus he has first put an urg within us that spur us to the pursuit no man can come to me said our lord except the father which hath sent me draw him and it is by this veri preveni draw that god take from us everi vestig of credit for the act of come the impuls to pursu god origin with god but the outwork of that impuls is our follow hard after him and all the time we are pursu him we are alreadi in his hand thi right hand upholdeth me in this divin uphold and human follow there is no contradict all is of god for as von hugel teach god is alway previous in practic howev that is where god previous work meet man present respons man must pursu god on our part there must be posit reciproc if this secret draw of god is to eventu in identifi experi of the divin in the warm languag of person feel this is state in the forti second psalm as the hart panteth after the water brook so panteth my soul after thee o god my soul thirsteth for god for the live god when shall i come and appear befor god this is deep call unto deep and the long heart will understand it the doctrin of justif by faitha biblic truth and a bless relief from steril legal and unavail self effortha in our time fallen into evil compani and been interpret by mani in such manner as actual to bar men from the knowledg of god the whole transact of religi convers has been made mechan and spiritless faith may now be exercis without a jar to the moral life and without embarrass to the adam ego christ may be receiv without creat ani special love for him in the soul of the receiv the man is save but he is not hungri nor thirsti after god in fact he is specif taught to be satisfi and encourag to be content with littl the modern scientist has lost god amid the wonder of his world we christian are in real danger of lose god amid the wonder of his word we have almost forgotten that god is a person and as such can be cultiv as ani person can it is inher in person to be abl to know other person but full knowledg of one person by anoth cannot be achiev in one encount it is onli after long and love mental intercours that the full possibl of both can be explor all social intercours between human be is a respons of person to person grade upward from the most casual brush between man and man to the fullest most intim communion of which the human soul is capabl religion so far as it is genuin is in essenc the respons of creat person to the creat person god this is life etern that they might know thee the onli true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent god is a person and in the deep of his mighti natur he think will enjoy feel love desir and suffer as ani other person may in make himself known to us he stay by the familiar pattern of person he communic with us through the avenu of our mind our will and our emot the continu and unembarrass interchang of love and thought between god and the soul of the redeem man is the throb heart of new testament religion this intercours between god and the soul is known to us in conscious person awar it is person that is it doe not come through the bodi of believ as such but is known to the individu and to the bodi through the individu which compos it and it is conscious that is it doe not stay below the threshold of conscious and work there unknown to the soul as for instanc infant baptism is thought by some to do but come within the field of awar where the man can know it as he know ani other fact of experi you and i are in littl our sin except what god is in larg be made in his imag we have within us the capac to know him in our sin we lack onli the power the moment the spirit has quicken us to life in regener our whole be sens it kinship to god and leap up in joyous recognit that is the heaven birth without which we cannot see the kingdom of god it is howev not an end but an incept for now begin the glorious pursuit the heart happi explor of the infinit rich of the godhead that is where we begin i say but where we stop no man has yet discov for there is in the aw and mysteri depth of the triun god neither limit nor end shoreless ocean who can sound thee thine own etern is round thee majesti divin to have found god and still to pursu him is the soul paradox of love scorn inde by the too easili satisfi religionist but justifi in happi experi by the children of the burn heart st bernard state this holi paradox in a music quatrain that will be instant understood by everi worship soul we tast thee o thou live bread and long to feast upon thee still we drink of thee the fountainhead and thirst our soul from thee to fill come near to the holi men and women of the past and you will soon feel the heat of their desir after god they mourn for him they pray and wrestl and sought for him day and night in season and out and when they had found him the find was all the sweeter for the long seek mose use the fact that he knew god as an argument for know him better now therefor i pray thee if i have found grace in thi sight show me now thi way that i may know thee that i may find grace in thi sight and from there he rose to make the dare request i beseech thee show me thi glori god was frank pleas by this display of ardor and the next day call mose into the mount and there in solemn process made all his glori pass befor him david life was a torrent of spiritu desir and his psalm ring with the cri of the seeker and the glad shout of the finder paul confess the mainspr of his life to be his burn desir after christ that i may know him was the goal of his heart and to this he sacrif everyth yea doubtless and i count all thing but loss for the excel of the knowledg of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffer the loss of all thing and do count them but refus that i may win christ hymnodi is sweet with the long after god the god whom while the singer seek he know he has alreadi found his track i see and ill pursu sang our father onli a short generat ago but that song is heard no more in the great congreg how tragic that we in this dark day have had our seek done for us by our teacher everyth is made to center upon the initi act of accept christ a term incident which is not found in the bibl and we are not expect thereaft to crave ani further revel of god to our soul we have been snare in the coil of a spurious logic which insist that if we have found him we need no more seek him this is set befor us as the last word in orthodoxi and it is taken for grant that no bibl taught christian ever believ otherwis thus the whole testimoni of the worship seek sing church on that subject is crispli set asid the experienti heart theolog of a grand armi of fragrant saint is reject in favor of a smug interpret of scriptur which would certain have sound strang to an augustin a rutherford or a brainerd in the midst of this great chill there are some i rejoic to acknowledg who will not be content with shallow logic they will admit the forc of the argument and then turn away with tear to hunt some lone place and pray o god show me thi glori they want to tast to touch with their heart to see with their inner eye the wonder that is god i want deliber to encourag this mighti long after god the lack of it has brought us to our present low estat the stiff and wooden qualiti about our religi live is a result of our lack of holi desir complac is a dead foe of all spiritu growth acut desir must be present or there will be no manifest of christ to his peopl he wait to be want too bad that with mani of us he wait so long so veri long in vain everi age has it own characterist right now we are in an age of religi complex the simplic which is in christ is rare found among us in it stead are program method organ and a world of nervous activ which occupi time and attent but can never satisfi the long of the heart the shallow of our inner experi the hollow of our worship and that servil imit of the world which mark our promot method all testifi that we in this day know god onli imperfect and the peac of god scarc at all if we would find god amid all the religi extern we must first determin to find him and then proceed in the way of simplic now as alway god discov himself to babe and hide himself in thick dark from the wise and the prudent we must simplifi our approach to him we must strip down to essenti and they will be found to be bless few we must put away all effort to impress and come with the guileless candor of childhood if we do this without doubt god will quick respond when religion has said it last word there is littl that we need other than god himself the evil habit of seek god and effect prevent us from find god in full revel in the and lie our great woe if we omit the and we shall soon find god and in him we shall find that for which we have all our live been secret long we need not fear that in seek god onli we may narrow our live or restrict the motion of our expand heart the opposit is true we can well afford to make god our all to concentr to sacrific the mani for the one the author of the quaint old english classic the cloud of unknow teach us how to do this lift up thine heart unto god with a meek stir of love and mean himself and none of his good and thereto look thee loath to think on aught but god himself so that nought work in thi wit nor in thi will but onli god himself this is the work of the soul that most pleaseth god again he recommend that in prayer we practic a further strip down of everyth even of our theolog for it sufficeth enough a nake intent direct unto god without ani other caus than himself yet underneath all his think lay the broad foundat of new testament truth for he explain that by himself he mean god that made thee and bought thee and that gracious call thee to thi degre and he is all for simplic if we would have religion lap and folden in one word for that thou shouldst have better hold thereupon take thee but a littl word of one syllabl for so it is better than of two for even the shorter it is the better it accordeth with the work of the spirit and such a word is this word god or this word love when the lord divid canaan among the tribe of israel levi receiv no share of the land god said to him simpli i am thi part and thine inherit and by those word made him richer than all his brethren richer than all the king and raja who have ever live in the world and there is a spiritu principl here a principl still valid for everi priest of the most high god the man who has god for his treasur has all thing in one mani ordinari treasur may be deni him or if he is allow to have them the enjoy of them will be so temper that they will never be necessari to his happi or if he must see them go one after one he will scarc feel a sens of loss for have the sourc of all thing he has in one all satisfact all pleasur all delight whatev he may lose he has actual lost noth for he now has it all in one and he has it pure legitim and forev o god i have tast thi good and it has both satisfi me and made me thirsti for more i am pain conscious of my need of further grace i am asham of my lack of desir o god the triun god i want to want thee i long to be fill with long i thirst to be made more thirsti still show me thi glori i pray thee that so i may know thee inde begin in merci a new work of love within me say to my soul rise up my love my fair one and come away then give me grace to rise and follow thee up from this misti lowland where i have wander so long in jesus name amen ii the blessed of possess noth bless are the poor in spirit for their is the kingdom of heavenmatt 53 befor the lord god made man upon the earth he first prepar for him by creat a world of use and pleasant thing for his susten and delight in the genesi account of the creation these are call simpli thing they were made for man use but they were meant alway to be extern to the man and subservi to him in the deep heart of the man was a shrine where none but god was worthi to come within him was god without a thousand gift which god had shower upon him but sin has introduc complic and has made those veri gift of god a potenti sourc of ruin to the soul our woe began when god was forc out of his central shrine and thing were allow to enter within the human heart thing have taken over men have now by natur no peac within their heart for god is crown there no longer but there in the moral dusk stubborn and aggress usurp fight among themselv for first place on the throne this is not a mere metaphor but an accur analysi of our real spiritu troubl there is within the human heart a tough fibrous root of fallen life whose natur is to possess alway to possess it covet thing with a deep and fierc passion the pronoun my and mine look innoc enough in print but their constant and univers use is signific they express the real natur of the old adam man better than a thousand volum of theolog could do they are verbal symptom of our deep diseas the root of our heart have grown down into thing and we dare not pull up one rootlet lest we die thing have becom necessari to us a develop never origin intend god gift now take the place of god and the whole cours of natur is upset by the monstrous substitut our lord refer to this tyranni of thing when he said to his discipl if ani man will come after me let him deni himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoev will save his life shall lose it and whosoev shall lose his life for my sake shall find it break this truth into fragment for our better understand it would seem that there is within each of us an enemi which we toler at our peril jesus call it life and self or as we would say the self life it chief characterist is it possess the word gain and profit suggest this to allow this enemi to live is in the end to lose everyth to repudi it and give up all for christ sake is to lose noth at last but to preserv everyth unto life etern and possibl also a hint is given here as to the onli effect way to destroy this foe it is by the cross let him take up his cross and follow me the way to deeper knowledg of god is through the lone valley of soul poverti and abneg of all thing the bless one who possess the kingdom are they who have repudi everi extern thing and have root from their heart all sens of possess these are the poor in spirit they have reach an inward state parallel the outward circumst of the common beggar in the street of jerusalem that is what the word poor as christ use it actual mean these bless poor are no longer slave to the tyranni of thing they have broken the yoke of the oppressor and this they have done not by fight but by surrend though free from all sens of possess they yet possess all thing their is the kingdom of heaven let me exhort you to take this serious it is not to be understood as mere bibl teach to be store away in the mind along with an inert mass of other doctrin it is a marker on the road to greener pastur a path chisel against the steep side of the mount of god we dare not tri to by pass it if we would follow on in this holi pursuit we must ascend a step at a time if we refus one step we bring our progress to an end as is frequent true this new testament principl of spiritu life find it best illustr in the old testament in the stori of abraham and isaac we have a dramat pictur of the surrend life as well as an excel commentari on the first beatitud abraham was old when isaac was born old enough inde to have been his grandfath and the child becam at onc the delight and idol of his heart from that moment when he first stoop to take the tini form awkward in his arm he was an eager love slave of his son god went out of his way to comment on the strength of this affect and it is not hard to understand the babi repres everyth sacr to his father heart the promis of god the coven the hope of the year and the long messian dream as he watch him grow from babyhood to young manhood the heart of the old man was knit closer and closer with the life of his son till at last the relationship border upon the peril it was then that god step in to save both father and son from the consequ of an uncleans love take now thi son said god to abraham thine onli son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offer upon one of the mountain which i will tell thee of the sacr writer spare us a close up of the agoni that night on the slope near beersheba when the age man had it out with his god but respect imagin may view in awe the bent form and convuls wrestl alon under the star possibl not again until a greater than abraham wrestl in the garden of gethseman did such mortal pain visit a human soul if onli the man himself might have been allow to die that would have been easier a thousand time for he was old now and to die would have been no great ordeal for one who had walk so long with god besid it would have been a last sweet pleasur to let his dim vision rest upon the figur of his stalwart son who would live to carri on the abraham line and fulfil in himself the promis of god made long befor in ur of the chalde how should he slay the lad even if he could get the consent of his wound and protest heart how could he reconcil the act with the promis in isaac shall thi seed be call this was abraham trial by fire and he did not fail in the crucibl while the star still shone like sharp white point abov the tent where the sleep isaac lay and long befor the gray dawn had begun to lighten the east the old saint had made up his mind he would offer his son as god had direct him to do and then trust god to rais him from the dead this say the writer to the hebrew was the solut his ach heart found sometim in the dark night and he rose earli in the morn to carri out the plan it is beauti to see that while he er as to god method he had correct sens the secret of his great heart and the solut accord well with the new testament scriptur whosoev will lose for my sake shall find god let the suffer old man go through with it up to the point where he knew there would be no retreat and then forbad him to lay a hand upon the boy to the wonder patriarch he now say in effect it all right abraham i never intend that you should actual slay the lad i onli want to remov him from the templ of your heart that i might reign unchalleng there i want to correct the pervers that exist in your love now you may have the boy sound and well take him and go back to your tent now i know that thou fearest god see that thou hast not withheld thi son thine onli son from me then heaven open and a voic was heard say to him by myself have i sworn saith the lord for becaus thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thi son thine onli son that in bless i will bless thee and in multipli i will multipli thi seed as the star of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thi seed shall possess the gate of his enemi and in thi seed shall all the nation of the earth be bless becaus thou hast obey my voic the old man of god lift his head to respond to the voic and stood there on the mount strong and pure and grand a man mark out by the lord for special treatment a friend and favorit of the most high now he was a man wholli surrend a man utter obedi a man who possess noth he had concentr his all in the person of his dear son and god had taken it from him god could have begun out on the margin of abraham life and work inward to the center he chose rather to cut quick to the heart and have it over in one sharp act of separ in deal thus he practic an economi of mean and time it hurt cruelli but it was effect i have said that abraham possess noth yet was not this poor man rich everyth he had own befor was his still to enjoy sheep camel herd and good of everi sort he had also his wife and his friend and best of all he had his son isaac safe by his side he had everyth but he possess noth there is the spiritu secret there is the sweet theolog of the heart which can be learn onli in the school of renunci the book on systemat theolog overlook this but the wise will understand after that bitter and bless experi i think the word my and mine never had again the same mean for abraham the sens of possess which they connot was gone from his heart thing had been cast out forev they had now becom extern to the man his inner heart was free from them the world said abraham is rich but the age patriarch onli smile he could not explain it to them but he knew that he own noth that his real treasur were inward and etern there can be no doubt that this possess cling to thing is one of the most harm habit in the life becaus it is so natur it is rare recogn for the evil that it is but it outwork are tragic we are often hinder from give up our treasur to the lord out of fear for their safeti this is especi true when those treasur are love relat and friend but we need have no such fear our lord came not to destroy but to save everyth is safe which we commit to him and noth is realli safe which is not so commit our gift and talent should also be turn over to him they should be recogn for what they are god loan to us and should never be consid in ani sens our own we have no more right to claim credit for special abil than for blue eye or strong muscl for who maketh thee to differ from anoth and what hast thou that thou didst not receiv the christian who is aliv enough to know himself even slight will recogn the symptom of this possess maladi and will griev to find them in his own heart if the long after god is strong enough within him he will want to do someth about the matter now what should he do first of all he should put away all defens and make no attempt to excus himself either in his own eye or befor the lord whoever defend himself will have himself for his defens and he will have no other but let him come defenseless befor the lord and he will have for his defend no less than god himself let the inquir christian trampl under foot everi slipperi trick of his deceit heart and insist upon frank and open relat with the lord then he should rememb that this is holi busi no careless or casual deal will suffic let him come to god in full determin to be heard let him insist that god accept his all that he take thing out of his heart and himself reign there in power it may be he will need to becom specif to name thing and peopl by their name one by one if he will becom drastic enough he can shorten the time of his travail from year to minut and enter the good land long befor his slower brethren who coddl their feel and insist upon caution in their deal with god let us never forget that such a truth as this cannot be learn by rote as one would learn the fact of physic scienc they must be experienc befor we can realli know them we must in our heart live through abraham harsh and bitter experi if we would know the blessed which follow them the ancient curs will not go out painless the tough old miser within us will not lie down and die obedi to our command he must be torn out of our heart like a plant from the soil he must be extract in agoni and blood like a tooth from the jaw he must be expel from our soul by violenc as christ expel the money changer from the templ and we shall need to steel ourselv against his piteous beg and to recogn it as spring out of self piti one of the most reprehens sin of the human heart if we would inde know god in grow intimaci we must go this way of renunci and if we are set upon the pursuit of god he will sooner or later bring us to this test abraham test was at the time not known to him as such yet if he had taken some cours other than the one he did the whole histori of the old testament would have been differ god would have found his man no doubt but the loss to abraham would have been tragic beyond the tell so we will be brought one by one to the test place and we may never know when we are there at that test place there will be no dozen possibl choic for us just one and an altern but our whole futur will be condit by the choic we make father i want to know thee but my coward heart fear to give up it toy i cannot part with them without inward bleed and i do not tri to hide from thee the terror of the part i come trembl but i do come pleas root from my heart all those thing which i have cherish so long and which have becom a veri part of my live self so that thou mayest enter and dwell there without a rival then shalt thou make the place of thi feet glorious then shall my heart have no need of the sun to shine in it for thyself wilt be the light of it and there shall be no night there in jesus name amen iii remov the veil have therefor brethren bold to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesusheb 1019 among the famous say of the church father none is better known than augustin thou hast form us for thyself and our heart are restless till they find rest in thee the great saint state here in few word the origin and interior histori of the human race god made us for himself that is the onli explan that satisfi the heart of a think man whatev his wild reason may say should faulti educ and pervers reason lead a man to conclud otherwis there is littl that ani christian can do for him for such a man i have no messag my appeal is address to those who have been previous taught in secret by the wisdom of god i speak to thirsti heart whose long have been waken by the touch of god within them and such as they need no reason proof their restless heart furnish all the proof they need god form us for himself the shorter catech agre upon by the reverend assembl of divin at westminst as the old new england primer has it ask the ancient question what and whi and answer them in one short sentenc hard match in ani uninspir work question what is the chief end of man answer man chief end is to glorifi god and enjoy him forev with this agre the four and twenti elder who fall on their face to worship him that liveth for ever and ever say thou art worthi o lord to receiv glori and honour and power for thou hast creat all thing and for thi pleasur they are and were creat god form us for his pleasur and so form us that we as well as he can in divin communion enjoy the sweet and mysteri mingl of kindr person he meant us to see him and live with him and draw our life from his smile but we have been guilti of that foul revolt of which milton speak when describ the rebellion of satan and his host we have broken with god we have ceas to obey him or love him and in guilt and fear have fled as far as possibl from his presenc yet who can flee from his presenc when the heaven and the heaven of heaven cannot contain him when as the wisdom of solomon testifi the spirit of the lord filleth the world the omnipres of the lord is one thing and is a solemn fact necessari to his perfect the manifest presenc is anoth thing altogeth and from that presenc we have fled like adam to hide among the tree of the garden or like peter to shrink away cri depart from me for i am a sin man o lord so the life of man upon the earth is a life away from the presenc wrench loos from that bliss center which is our right and proper dwell place our first estat which we kept not the loss of which is the caus of our unceas restless the whole work of god in redempt is to undo the tragic effect of that foul revolt and to bring us back again into right and etern relationship with himself this requir that our sin be dispos of satisfactorili that a full reconcili be effect and the way open for us to return again into conscious communion with god and to live again in the presenc as befor then by his preveni work within us he move us to return this first come to our notic when our restless heart feel a yearn for the presenc of god and we say within ourselv i will aris and go to my father that is the first step and as the chines sage lao tze has said the journey of a thousand mile begin with a first step the interior journey of the soul from the wild of sin into the enjoy presenc of god is beauti illustr in the old testament tabernacl the return sinner first enter the outer court where he offer a blood sacrific on the brazen altar and wash himself in the laver that stood near it then through a veil he pass into the holi place where no natur light could come but the golden candlestick which spoke of jesus the light of the world threw it soft glow over all there also was the shewbread to tell of jesus the bread of life and the altar of incens a figur of unceas prayer though the worshipp had enjoy so much still he had not yet enter the presenc of god anoth veil separ from the holi of holi where abov the merci seat dwelt the veri god himself in aw and glorious manifest while the tabernacl stood onli the high priest could enter there and that but onc a year with blood which he offer for his sin and the sin of the peopl it was this last veil which was rent when our lord gave up the ghost on calvari and the sacr writer explain that this rend of the veil open the way for everi worshipp in the world to come by the new and live way straight into the divin presenc everyth in the new testament accord with this old testament pictur ransom men need no longer paus in fear to enter the holi of holi god will that we should push on into his presenc and live our whole life there this is to be known to us in conscious experi it is more than a doctrin to be held it is a life to be enjoy everi moment of everi day this flame of the presenc was the beat heart of the levit order without it all the appoint of the tabernacl were charact of some unknown languag they had no mean for israel or for us the greatest fact of the tabernacl was that jehovah was there a presenc was wait within the veil similar the presenc of god is the central fact of christian at the heart of the christian messag is god himself wait for his redeem children to push in to conscious awar of his presenc that type of christian which happen now to be the vogu know this presenc onli in theori it fail to stress the christian privileg of present realize accord to it teach we are in the presenc of god posit and noth is said about the need to experi that presenc actual the fieri urg that drove men like mccheyn is wholli miss and the present generat of christian measur itself by this imperfect rule ignobl content take the place of burn zeal we are satisfi to rest in our judici possess and for the most part we bother ourselv veri littl about the absenc of person experi who is this within the veil who dwell in fieri manifest it is none other than god himself one god the father almighti maker of heaven and earth and of all thing visibl and invis and one lord jesus christ the onli begotten son of god begotten of his father befor all world god of god light of light veri god of veri god begotten not made be of one substanc with the father and the holi ghost the lord and giver of life who proceedeth from the father and the son who with the father and the son togeth is worship and glorifi yet this holi triniti is one god for we worship one god in triniti and triniti in uniti neither confound the person nor divid the substanc for there is one person of the father anoth of the son and anoth of the holi ghost but the godhead of the father of the son and of the holi ghost is all one the glori equal and the majesti co etern so in part run the ancient creed and so the inspir word declar behind the veil is god that god after whom the world with strang inconsist has felt if hapli they might find him he has discov himself to some extent in natur but more perfect in the incarn now he wait to show himself in ravish ful to the humbl of soul and the pure in heart the world is perish for lack of the knowledg of god and the church is famish for want of his presenc the instant cure of most of our religi ill would be to enter the presenc in spiritu experi to becom sudden awar that we are in god and that god is in us this would lift us out of our piti narrow and caus our heart to be enlarg this would burn away the impur from our live as the bug and fungi were burn away by the fire that dwelt in the bush what a broad world to roam in what a sea to swim in is this god and father of our lord jesus christ he is etern which mean that he anted time and is wholli independ of it time began in him and will end in him to it he pay no tribut and from it he suffer no chang he is immut which mean that he has never chang and can never chang in ani smallest measur to chang he would need to go from better to wors or from wors to better he cannot do either for be perfect he cannot becom more perfect and if he were to becom less perfect he would be less than god he is omnisci which mean that he know in one free and effortless act all matter all spirit all relationship all event he has no past and he has no futur he is and none of the limit and qualifi term use of creatur can appli to him love and merci and righteous are his and holi so ineff that no comparison or figur will avail to express it onli fire can give even a remot concept of it in fire he appear at the burn bush in the pillar of fire he dwelt through all the long wilder journey the fire that glow between the wing of the cherubim in the holi place was call the shekinah the presenc through the year of israel glori and when the old had given place to the new he came at pentecost as a fieri flame and rest upon each discipl spinoza wrote of the intellectu love of god and he had a measur of truth there but the highest love of god is not intellectu it is spiritu god is spirit and onli the spirit of man can know him realli in the deep spirit of a man the fire must glow or his love is not the true love of god the great of the kingdom have been those who love god more than other did we all know who they have been and glad pay tribut to the depth and sincer of their devot we have but to paus for a moment and their name come troop past us smell of myrrh and alo and cassia out of the ivori palac frederick faber was one whose soul pant after god as the roe pant after the water brook and the measur in which god reveal himself to his seek heart set the good man whole life afir with a burn ador rival that of the seraphim befor the throne his love for god extend to the three person of the godhead equal yet he seem to feel for each one a special kind of love reserv for him alon of god the father he sing onli to sit and think of god oh what a joy it is to think the thought to breath the name earth has no higher bliss father of jesus love reward what raptur will it be prostrat befor thi throne to lie and gaze and gaze on thee his love for the person of christ was so intens that it threaten to consum him it burn within him as a sweet and holi mad and flow from his lip like molten gold in one of his sermon he say wherev we turn in the church of god there is jesus he is the begin middl and end of everyth to us there is noth good noth holi noth beauti noth joyous which he is not to his servant no one need be poor becaus if he choos he can have jesus for his own properti and possess no one need be downcast for jesus is the joy of heaven and it is his joy to enter into sorrow heart we can exagger about mani thing but we can never exagger our oblig to jesus or the compassion abund of the love of jesus to us all our live long we might talk of jesus and yet we should never come to an end of the sweet thing that might be said of him etern will not be long enough to learn all he is or to prais him for all he has done but then that matter not for we shall be alway with him and we desir noth more and address our lord direct he say to him i love thee so i know not how my transport to control thi love is like a burn fire within my veri soul faber blaze love extend also to the holi spirit not onli in his theolog did he acknowledg his deiti and full equal with the father and the son but he celebr it constant in his song and in his prayer he liter press his forehead to the ground in his eager fervid worship of the third person of the godhead in one of his great hymn to the holi spirit he sum up his burn devot thus o spirit beauti and dread my heart is fit to break with love of all thi tender for us poor sinner sake i have risk the tedium of quotat that i might show by point exampl what i have set out to say viz that god is so vast wonder so utter and complet delight that he can without anyth other than himself meet and overflow the deepest demand of our total natur mysteri and deep as that natur is such worship as faber knew and he is but one of a great compani which no man can number can never come from a mere doctrin knowledg of god heart that are fit to break with love for the godhead are those who have been in the presenc and have look with open eye upon the majesti of deiti men of the break heart had a qualiti about them not known to or understood by common men they habitu spoke with spiritu author they had been in the presenc of god and they report what they saw there they were prophet not scribe for the scribe tell us what he has read and the prophet tell what he has seen the distinct is not an imaginari one between the scribe who has read and the prophet who has seen there is a differ as wide as the sea we are today overrun with orthodox scribe but the prophet where are they the hard voic of the scribe sound over evangel but the church wait for the tender voic of the saint who has penetr the veil and has gaze with inward eye upon the wonder that is god and yet thus to penetr to push in sensit live experi into the holi presenc is a privileg open to everi child of god with the veil remov by the rend of jesus flesh with noth on god side to prevent us from enter whi do we tarri without whi do we consent to abid all our day just outsid the holi of holi and never enter at all to look upon god we hear the bridegroom say let me see thi counten let me hear thi voic for sweet is thi voic and thi counten is come we sens that the call is for us but still we fail to draw near and the year pass and we grow old and tire in the outer court of the tabernacl what doth hinder us the answer usual given simpli that we are cold will not explain all the fact there is someth more serious than cold of heart someth that may be back of that cold and be the caus of it exist what is it what but the presenc of a veil in our heart a veil not taken away as the first veil was but which remain there still shut out the light and hide the face of god from us it is the veil of our flesh fallen natur live on unjudg within us uncrucifi and unrepudi it is the close woven veil of the self life which we have never truli acknowledg of which we have been secret asham and which for these reason we have never brought to the judgment of the cross it is not too mysteri this opaqu veil nor is it hard to identifi we have but to look in our own heart and we shall see it there sewn and patch and repair it may be but there nevertheless an enemi to our live and an effect block to our spiritu progress this veil is not a beauti thing and it is not a thing about which we common care to talk but i am address the thirst soul who are determin to follow god and i know they will not turn back becaus the way lead temporarili through the blacken hill the urg of god within them will assur their continu the pursuit they will face the fact howev unpleas and endur the cross for the joy set befor them so i am bold to name the thread out of which this inner veil is woven it is woven of the fine thread of the self life the hyphen sin of the human spirit they are not someth we do they are someth we are and therein lie both their subtleti and their power to be specif the self sin are these self righteous self piti self confid self suffici self admir self love and a host of other like them they dwell too deep within us and are too much a part of our natur to come to our attent till the light of god is focus upon them the grosser manifest of these sin egot exhibition self promot are strang toler in christian leader even in circl of impecc orthodoxi they are so much in evid as actual for mani peopl to becom identifi with the gospel i trust it is not a cynic observ to say that they appear these day to be a requisit for popular in some section of the church visibl promot self under the guis of promot christ is current so common as to excit littl notic one should suppos that proper instruct in the doctrin of man deprav and the necess for justif through the righteous of christ alon would deliv us from the power of the self sin but it doe not work out that way self can live unrebuk at the veri altar it can watch the bleed victim die and not be in the least affect by what it see it can fight for the faith of the reform and preach eloqu the creed of salvat by grace and gain strength by it effort to tell all the truth it seem actual to feed upon orthodoxi and is more at home in a bibl confer than in a tavern our veri state of long after god may afford it an excel condit under which to thrive and grow self is the opaqu veil that hide the face of god from us it can be remov onli in spiritu experi never by mere instruct as well tri to instruct leprosi out of our system there must be a work of god in destruct befor we are free we must invit the cross to do it dead work within us we must bring our self sin to the cross for judgment we must prepar ourselv for an ordeal of suffer in some measur like that through which our saviour pass when he suffer under pontius pilat let us rememb when we talk of the rend of the veil we are speak in a figur and the thought of it is poetic almost pleasant but in actual there is noth pleasant about it in human experi that veil is made of live spiritu tissu it is compos of the sentient quiver stuff of which our whole be consist and to touch it is to touch us where we feel pain to tear it away is to injur us to hurt us and make us bleed to say otherwis is to make the cross no cross and death no death at all it is never fun to die to rip through the dear and tender stuff of which life is made can never be anyth but deepli pain yet that is what the cross did to jesus and it is what the cross would do to everi man to set him free let us bewar of tinker with our inner life in hope ourselv to rend the veil god must do everyth for us our part is to yield and trust we must confess forsak repudi the self life and then reckon it crucifi but we must be care to distinguish lazi accept from the real work of god we must insist upon the work be done we dare not rest content with a neat doctrin of self crucifixion that is to imit saul and spare the best of the sheep and the oxen insist that the work be done in veri truth and it will be done the cross is rough and it is dead but it is effect it doe not keep it victim hang there forev there come a moment when it work is finish and the suffer victim die after that is resurrect glori and power and the pain is forgotten for joy that the veil is taken away and we have enter in actual spiritu experi the presenc of the live god lord how excel are thi way and how devious and dark are the way of man show us how to die that we may rise again to new of life rend the veil of our self life from the top down as thou didst rend the veil of the templ we would draw near in full assur of faith we would dwell with thee in daili experi here on this earth so that we may be accustom to the glori when we enter thi heaven to dwell with thee there in jesus name amen iv apprehend god o tast and seepsa 348 it was canon holm of india who more than twenti five year ago call attent to the inferenti charact of the averag man faith in god to most peopl god is an infer not a realiti he is a deduct from evid which they consid adequ but he remain person unknown to the individu he must be they say therefor we believ he is other do not go even so far as this they know of him onli by hearsay they have never bother to think the matter out for themselv but have heard about him from other and have put belief in him into the back of their mind along with the various odd and end that make up their total creed to mani other god is but an ideal anoth name for good or beauti or truth or he is law or life or the creativ impuls back of the phenomena of exist these notion about god are mani and vari but they who hold them have one thing in common they do not know god in person experi the possibl of intim acquaint with him has not enter their mind while admit his exist they do not think of him as knowabl in the sens that we know thing or peopl christian to be sure go further than this at least in theori their creed requir them to believ in the person of god and they have been taught to pray our father which art in heaven now person and fatherhood carri with them the idea of the possibl of person acquaint this is admit i say in theori but for million of christian nevertheless god is no more real than he is to the non christian they go through life tri to love an ideal and be loyal to a mere principl over against all this cloudi vagu stand the clear scriptur doctrin that god can be known in person experi a love person domin the bibl walk among the tree of the garden and breath fragranc over everi scene alway a live person is present speak plead love work and manifest himself whenev and wherev his peopl have the recept necessari to receiv the manifest the bibl assum as a self evid fact that men can know god with at least the same degre of immediaci as they know ani other person or thing that come within the field of their experi the same term are use to express the knowledg of god as are use to express knowledg of physic thing o tast and see that the lord is good all thi garment smell of myrrh and alo and cassia out of the ivori palac my sheep hear my voic bless are the pure in heart for they shall see god these are but four of countless such passag from the word of god and more import than ani proof text is the fact that the whole import of the scriptur is toward this belief what can all this mean except that we have in our heart organ by mean of which we can know god as certain as we know materi thing through our familiar five sens we apprehend the physic world by exercis the faculti given us for the purpos and we possess spiritu faculti by mean of which we can know god and the spiritu world if we will obey the spirit urg and begin to use them that a save work must first be done in the heart is taken for grant here the spiritu faculti of the unregener man lie asleep in his natur unus and for everi purpos dead that is the stroke which has fallen upon us by sin they may be quicken to activ life again by the oper of the holi spirit in regener that is one of the immeasur benefit which come to us through christ aton work on the cross but the veri ransom children of god themselv whi do they know so littl of that habitu conscious communion with god which the scriptur seem to offer the answer is our chronic unbelief faith enabl our spiritu sens to function where faith is defect the result will be inward insens and numb toward spiritu thing this is the condit of vast number of christian today no proof is necessari to support that statement we have but to convers with the first christian we meet or enter the first church we find open to acquir all the proof we need a spiritu kingdom lie all about us enclos us embrac us altogeth within reach of our inner selv wait for us to recogn it god himself is here wait our respons to his presenc this etern world will come aliv to us the moment we begin to reckon upon it realiti i have just now use two word which demand definit or if definit is imposs i must at least make clear what i mean when i use them they are reckon and realiti what do i mean by realiti i mean that which has exist apart from ani idea ani mind may have of it and which would exist if there were no mind anywher to entertain a thought of it that which is real has be in itself it doe not depend upon the observ for it valid i am awar that there are those who love to poke fun at the plain man idea of realiti they are the idealist who spin endless proof that noth is real outsid of the mind they are the relativist who like to show that there are no fix point in the univers from which we can measur anyth they smile down upon us from their lofti intellectu peak and settl us to their own satisfact by fasten upon us the reproach term absolutist the christian is not put out of counten by this show of contempt he can smile right back at them for he know that there is onli one who is absolut that is god but he know also that the absolut one has made this world for man use and while there is noth fix or real in the last mean of the word the mean as appli to god for everi purpos of human life we are permit to act as if there were and everi man doe act thus except the mental sick these unfortun also have troubl with realiti but they are consist they insist upon live in accord with their idea of thing they are honest and it is their veri honesti that constitut them a social problem the idealist and relativist are not mental sick they prove their sound by live their live accord to the veri notion of realiti which they in theori repudi and by count upon the veri fix point which they prove are not there they could earn a lot more respect for their notion if they were will to live by them but this they are care not to do their idea are brain deep not life deep wherev life touch them they repudi their theori and live like other men the christian is too sincer to play with idea for their own sake he take no pleasur in the mere spin of gossam web for display all his belief are practic they are gear into his life by them he live or die stand or fall for this world and for all time to come from the insincer man he turn away the sincer plain man know that the world is real he find it here when he wake to conscious and he know that he did not think it into be it was here wait for him when he came and he know that when he prepar to leav this earth scene it will be here still to bid him good bye as he depart by the deep wisdom of life he is wiser than a thousand men who doubt he stand upon the earth and feel the wind and rain in his face and he know that they are real he see the sun by day and the star by night he see the hot lightn play out of the dark thundercloud he hear the sound of natur and the cri of human joy and pain these he know are real he lie down on the cool earth at night and has no fear that it will prove illusori or fail him while he sleep in the morn the firm ground will be under him the blue sky abov him and the rock and tree around him as when he close his eye the night befor so he live and rejoic in a world of realiti with his five sens he engag this real world all thing necessari to his physic exist he apprehend by the faculti with which he has been equip by the god who creat him and place him in such a world as this now by our definit also god is real he is real in the absolut and final sens that noth els is all other realiti is conting upon his the great realiti is god who is the author of that lower and depend realiti which make up the sum of creat thing includ ourselv god has object exist independ of and apart from ani notion which we may have concern him the worship heart doe not creat it object it find him here when it wake from it moral slumber in the morn of it regener anoth word that must be clear up is the word reckon this doe not mean to visual or imagin imagin is not faith the two are not onli differ from but stand in sharp opposit to each other imagin project unreal imag out of the mind and seek to attach realiti to them faith creat noth it simpli reckon upon that which is alreadi there god and the spiritu world are real we can reckon upon them with as much assur as we reckon upon the familiar world around us spiritu thing are there or rather we should say here invit our attent and challeng our trust our troubl is that we have establish bad thought habit we habitu think of the visibl world as real and doubt the realiti of ani other we do not deni the exist of the spiritu world but we doubt that it is real in the accept mean of the word the world of sens intrud upon our attent day and night for the whole of our lifetim it is clamor insist and self demonstr it doe not appeal to our faith it is here assault our five sens demand to be accept as real and final but sin has so cloud the lens of our heart that we cannot see that other realiti the citi of god shine around us the world of sens triumph the visibl becom the enemi of the invis the tempor of the etern that is the curs inherit by everi member of adam tragic race at the root of the christian life lie belief in the invis the object of the christian faith is unseen realiti our uncorrect think influenc by the blind of our natur heart and the intrus ubiqu of visibl thing tend to draw a contrast between the spiritu and the real but actual no such contrast exist the antithesi lie elsewher between the real and the imaginari between the spiritu and the materi between the tempor and the etern but between the spiritu and the real never the spiritu is real if we would rise into that region of light and power plain beckon us through the scriptur of truth we must break the evil habit of ignor the spiritu we must shift our interest from the seen to the unseen for the great unseen realiti is god he that cometh to god must believ that he is and that he is a reward of them that dilig seek him this is basic in the life of faith from there we can rise to unlimit height ye believ in god said our lord jesus christ believ also in me without the first there can be no second if we truli want to follow god we must seek to be other world this i say know well that that word has been use with scorn by the son of this world and appli to the christian as a badg of reproach so be it everi man must choos his world if we who follow christ with all the fact befor us and know what we are about deliber choos the kingdom of god as our sphere of interest i see no reason whi anyon should object if we lose by it the loss is our own if we gain we rob no one by so do the other world which is the object of this world disdain and the subject of the drunkard mock song is our care chosen goal and the object of our holiest long but we must avoid the common fault of push the other world into the futur it is not futur but present it parallel our familiar physic world and the door between the two world are open ye are come say the writer to the hebrew and the tens is plain present unto mount zion and unto the citi of the live god the heaven jerusalem and to an innumer compani of angel to the general assembl and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judg of all and to the spirit of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediat of the new coven and to the blood of sprinkl that speaketh better thing than that of abel all these thing are contrast with the mount that might be touch and the sound of a trumpet and the voic of word that might be heard may we not safe conclud that as the realiti of mount sinai were apprehend by the sens so the realiti of mount zion are to be grasp by the soul and this not by ani trick of the imagin but in downright actual the soul has eye with which to see and ear with which to hear feebl they may be from long disus but by the life give touch of christ aliv now and capabl of sharpest sight and most sensit hear as we begin to focus upon god the thing of the spirit will take shape befor our inner eye obedi to the word of christ will bring an inward revel of the godhead john 1421 23 it will give acut percept enabl us to see god even as is promis to the pure in heart a new god conscious will seiz upon us and we shall begin to tast and hear and inward feel the god who is our life and our all there will be seen the constant shine of the light that lighteth everi man that cometh into the world more and more as our faculti grow sharper and more sure god will becom to us the great all and his presenc the glori and wonder of our live o god quicken to life everi power within me that i may lay hold on etern thing open my eye that i may see give me acut spiritu percept enabl me to tast thee and know that thou art good make heaven more real to me than ani earth thing has ever been amen v the univers presenc whither shall i go from thi spirit or whither shall i flee from thi presencepsa 1397 in all christian teach certain basic truth are found hidden at time and rather assum than assert but necessari to all truth as the primari color are found in and necessari to the finish paint such a truth is the divin imman god dwell in his creation and is everywher indivis present in all his work this is bold taught by prophet and apostl and is accept by christian theolog general that is it appear in the book but for some reason it has not sunk into the averag christian heart so as to becom a part of his believ self christian teacher shi away from it full implic and if they mention it at all mute it down till it has littl mean i would guess the reason for this to be the fear of be charg with pantheism but the doctrin of the divin presenc is definit not pantheism pantheism error is too palpabl to deceiv anyon it is that god is the sum of all creat thing natur and god are one so that whoever touch a leaf or a stone touch god that is of cours to degrad the glori of the incorrupt deiti and in an effort to make all thing divin banish all divin from the world entir the truth is that while god dwell in his world he is separ from it by a gulf forev impass howev close he may be identifi with the work of his hand they are and must etern be other than he and he is and must be anteced to and independ of them he is transcend abov all his work even while he is imman within them what now doe the divin imman mean in direct christian experi it mean simpli that god is here wherev we are god is here there is no place there can be no place where he is not ten million intellig stand at as mani point in space and separ by incomprehens distanc can each one say with equal truth god is here no point is nearer to god than ani other point it is exact as near to god from ani place as it is from ani other place no one is in mere distanc ani further from or ani nearer to god than ani other person is these are truth believ by everi instruct christian it remain for us to think on them and pray over them until they begin to glow within us in the begin god not matter for matter is not self caus it requir an anteced caus and god is that caus not law for law is but a name for the cours which all creation follow that cours had to be plan and the planner is god not mind for mind also is a creat thing and must have a creator back of it in the begin god the uncaus caus of matter mind and law there we must begin adam sin and in his panic frantic tri to do the imposs he tri to hide from the presenc of god david also must have had wild thought of tri to escap from the presenc for he wrote whither shall i go from thi spirit or whither shall i flee from thi presenc then he proceed through one of his most beauti psalm to celebr the glori of the divin imman if i ascend up into heaven thou art there if i make my bed in hell behold thou art there if i take the wing of the morn and dwell in the uttermost part of the sea even there shall thi hand lead me and thi right hand shall hold me and he knew that god be and god see are the same that the see presenc had been with him even befor he was born watch the mysteri of unfold life solomon exclaim but will god inde dwell on the earth behold the heaven and the heaven of heaven cannot contain thee how much less this hous which i have build paul assur the athenian that god is not far from ani one of us for in him we live and move and have our be if god is present at everi point in space if we cannot go where he is not cannot even conceiv of a place where he is not whi then has not that presenc becom the one univers celebr fact of the world the patriarch jacob in the wast howl wilder gave the answer to that question he saw a vision of god and cri out in wonder sure the lord is in this place and i knew it not jacob had never been for one small divis of a moment outsid the circl of that all pervad presenc but he knew it not that was his troubl and it is our men do not know that god is here what a differ it would make if they knew the presenc and the manifest of the presenc are not the same there can be the one without the other god is here when we are wholli unawar of it he is manifest onli when and as we are awar of his presenc on our part there must be surrend to the spirit of god for his work it is to show us the father and the son if we co oper with him in love obedi god will manifest himself to us and that manifest will be the differ between a nomin christian life and a life radiant with the light of his face alway everywher god is present and alway he seek to discov himself to each one he would reveal not onli that he is but what he is as well he did not have to be persuad to discov himself to mose and the lord descend in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaim the name of the lord he not onli made a verbal proclam of his natur but he reveal his veri self to mose so that the skin of mose face shone with the supernatur light it will be a great moment for some of us when we begin to believ that god promis of self revel is liter true that he promis much but promis no more than he intend to fulfil our pursuit of god is success just becaus he is forev seek to manifest himself to us the revel of god to ani man is not god come from a distanc upon a time to pay a brief and moment visit to the man soul thus to think of it is to misunderstand it all the approach of god to the soul or of the soul to god is not to be thought of in spatial term at all there is no idea of physic distanc involv in the concept it is not a matter of mile but of experi to speak of be near to or far from god is to use languag in a sens alway understood when appli to our ordinari human relationship a man may say i feel that my son is come nearer to me as he get older and yet that son has live by his father side sinc he was born and has never been away from home more than a day or so in his entir life what then can the father mean obvious he is speak of experi he mean that the boy is come to know him more intim and with deeper understand that the barrier of thought and feel between the two are disappear that father and son are becom more close unit in mind and heart so when we sing draw me nearer nearer bless lord we are not think of the near of place but of the near of relationship it is for increas degre of awar that we pray for a more perfect conscious of the divin presenc we need never shout across the space to an absent god he is nearer than our own soul closer than our most secret thought whi do some person find god in a way that other do not whi doe god manifest his presenc to some and let multitud of other struggl along in the half light of imperfect christian experi of cours the will of god is the same for all he has no favorit within his household all he has ever done for ani of his children he will do for all of his children the differ lie not with god but with us pick at random a score of great saint whose live and testimoni are wide known let them be bibl charact or well known christian of post biblic time you will be struck instant with the fact that the saint were not alik sometim the unlik were so great as to be posit glare how differ for exampl was mose from isaiah how differ was elijah from david how unlik each other were john and paul st franci and luther finney and thoma Ã  kempi the differ are as wide as human life itself differ of race nation educ tempera habit and person qualiti yet they all walk each in his day upon a high road of spiritu live far abov the common way their differ must have been incident and in the eye of god of no signific in some vital qualiti they must have been alik what was it i ventur to suggest that the one vital qualiti which they had in common was spiritu recept someth in them was open to heaven someth which urg them godward without attempt anyth like a profound analysi i shall say simpli that they had spiritu awar and that they went on to cultiv it until it becam the biggest thing in their live they differ from the averag person in that when they felt the inward long they did someth about it they acquir the lifelong habit of spiritu respons they were not disobedi to the heaven vision as david put it neat when thou saidst seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thi face lord will i seek as with everyth good in human life back of this recept is god the sovereignti of god is here and is felt even by those who have not place particular stress upon it theolog the pious michael angelo confess this in a sonnet my unassist heart is barren clay that of it nativ self can noth feed of good and pious work thou art the seed that quicken onli where thou sayest it may unless thou show to us thine own true way no man can find it father thou must lead these word will repay studi as the deep and serious testimoni of a great christian import as it is that we recogn god work in us i would yet warn against a too great preoccup with the thought it is a sure road to steril passiv god will not hold us respons to understand the mysteri of elect predestin and the divin sovereignti the best and safest way to deal with these truth is to rais our eye to god and in deepest rever say o lord thou knowest those thing belong to the deep and mysteri profound of god omnisci pri into them may make theologian but it will never make saint recept is not a singl thing it is a compound rather a blend of sever element within the soul it is an affin for a bent toward a sympathet respons to a desir to have from this it may be gather that it can be present in degre that we may have littl or more or less depend upon the individu it may be increas by exercis or destroy by neglect it is not a sovereign and irresist forc which come upon us as a seizur from abov it is a gift of god inde but one which must be recogn and cultiv as ani other gift if it is to realiz the purpos for which it was given failur to see this is the caus of a veri serious breakdown in modern evangel the idea of cultiv and exercis so dear to the saint of old has now no place in our total religi pictur it is too slow too common we now demand glamour and fast flow dramat action a generat of christian rear among push button and automat machin is impati of slower and less direct method of reach their goal we have been tri to appli machin age method to our relat with god we read our chapter have our short devot and rush away hope to make up for our deep inward bankruptci by attend anoth gospel meet or listen to anoth thrill stori told by a religi adventur late return from afar the tragic result of this spirit are all about us shallow live hollow religi philosophi the preponder of the element of fun in gospel meet the glorif of men trust in religi extern quasi religi fellowship salesmanship method the mistak of dynam person for the power of the spirit these and such as these are the symptom of an evil diseas a deep and serious maladi of the soul for this great sick that is upon us no one person is respons and no christian is wholli free from blame we have all contribut direct or indirect to this sad state of affair we have been too blind to see or too timid to speak out or too self satisfi to desir anyth better than the poor averag diet with which other appear satisfi to put it differ we have accept one anoth notion copi one anoth live and made one anoth experi the model for our own and for a generat the trend has been downward now we have reach a low place of sand and burnt wire grass and worst of all we have made the word of truth conform to our experi and accept this low plane as the veri pastur of the bless it will requir a determin heart and more than a littl courag to wrench ourselv loos from the grip of our time and return to biblic way but it can be done everi now and then in the past christian have had to do it histori has record sever larg scale return led by such men as st franci martin luther and georg fox unfortun there seem to be no luther or fox on the horizon at present whether or not anoth such return may be expect befor the come of christ is a question upon which christian are not fulli agre but that is not of too great import to us now what god in his sovereignti may yet do on a world scale i do not claim to know but what he will do for the plain man or woman who seek his face i believ i do know and can tell other let ani man turn to god in earnest let him begin to exercis himself unto godli let him seek to develop his power of spiritu recept by trust and obedi and humil and the result will exceed anyth he may have hope in his leaner and weaker day ani man who by repent and a sincer return to god will break himself out of the mold in which he has been held and will go to the bibl itself for his spiritu standard will be delight with what he find there let us say it again the univers presenc is a fact god is here the whole univers is aliv with his life and he is no strang or foreign god but the familiar father of our lord jesus christ whose love has for these thousand of year enfold the sin race of men and alway he is tri to get our attent to reveal himself to us to communic with us we have within us the abil to know him if we will but respond to his overtur and this we call pursu god we will know him in increas degre as our recept becom more perfect by faith and love and practic o god and father i repent of my sin preoccup with visibl thing the world has been too much with me thou hast been here and i knew it not i have been blind to thi presenc open my eye that i may behold thee in and around me for christ sake amen vi the speak voic in the begin was the word and the word was with god and the word was godjohn 11 an intellig plain man untaught in the truth of christian come upon this text would like conclud that john meant to teach that it is the natur of god to speak to communic his thought to other and he would be right a word is a medium by which thought are express and the applic of term to the etern son lead us to believ that self express is inher in the godhead that god is forev seek to speak himself out to his creation the whole bibl support the idea god is speak not god spoke but god is speak he is by his natur continu articul he fill the world with his speak voic one of the great realiti with which we have to deal is the voic of god in his world the briefest and onli satisfi cosmogoni is this he spake and it was done the whi of natur law is the live voic of god imman in his creation and this word of god which brought all world into be cannot be understood to mean the bibl for it is not a written or print word at all but the express of the will of god spoken into the structur of all thing this word of god is the breath of god fill the world with live potenti the voic of god is the most power forc in natur inde the onli forc in natur for all energi is here onli becaus the power fill word is be spoken the bibl is the written word of god and becaus it is written it is confin and limit by the necess of ink and paper and leather the voic of god howev is aliv and free as the sovereign god is free the word that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life the life is in the speak word god word in the bibl can have power onli becaus it correspond to god word in the univers it is the present voic which make the written word all power otherwis it would lie lock in slumber within the cover of a book we take a low and primit view of thing when we conceiv of god at the creation come into physic contact with thing shape and fit and build like a carpent the bibl teach otherwis by the word of the lord were the heaven made and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth for he spake and it was done he command and it stood fast through faith we understand that the world were frame by the word of god again we must rememb that god is refer here not to his written word but to his speak voic his world fill voic is meant that voic which anted the bibl by uncount centuri that voic which has not been silent sinc the dawn of creation but is sound still throughout the full far reach of the univers the word of god is quick and power in the begin he spoke to noth and it becam someth chao heard it and becam order dark heard it and becam light and god saidand it was so these twin phrase as caus and effect occur throughout the genesi stori of the creation the said account for the so the so is the said put into the continu present that god is here and that he is speakingthes truth are back of all other bibl truth without them there could be no revel at all god did not write a book and send it by messeng to be read at a distanc by unaid mind he spoke a book and live in his spoken word constant speak his word and caus the power of them to persist across the year god breath on clay and it becam a man he breath on men and they becom clay return ye children of men was the word spoken at the fall by which god decre the death of everi man and no ad word has he need to speak the sad process of mankind across the face of the earth from birth to the grave is proof that his origin word was enough we have not given suffici attent to that deep utter in the book of john that was the true light which lighteth everi man that cometh into the world shift the punctuat around as we will and the truth is still there the word of god affect the heart of all men as light in the soul in the heart of all men the light shine the word sound and there is no escap them someth like this would of necess be so if god is aliv and in his world and john say that it is so even those person who have never heard of the bibl have still been preach to with suffici clariti to remov everi excus from their heart forev which show the work of the law written in their heart their conscienc also bear wit and their thought the mean while either accus or els excus one anoth for the invis thing of him from the creation of the world are clear seen be understood by the thing that are made even his etern power and godhead so that they are without excus this univers voic of god was by the ancient hebrew often call wisdom and was said to be everywher sound and search throughout the earth seek some respons from the son of men the eighth chapter of the book of proverb begin doth not wisdom cri and understand put forth her voic the writer then pictur wisdom as a beauti woman stand in the top of the high place by the way in the place of the path she sound her voic from everi quarter so that no one may miss hear it unto you o men i call and my voic is to the son of men then she plead for the simpl and the foolish to give ear to her word it is spiritu respons for which this wisdom of god is plead a respons which she has alway sought and is but rare abl to secur the tragedi is that our etern welfar depend upon our hear and we have train our ear not to hear this univers voic has ever sound and it has often troubl men even when they did not understand the sourc of their fear could it be that this voic distil like a live mist upon the heart of men has been the undiscov caus of the troubl conscienc and the long for immort confess by million sinc the dawn of record histori we need not fear to face up to this the speak voic is a fact how men have react to it is for ani observ to note when god spoke out of heaven to our lord self center men who heard it explain it by natur caus they said it thunder this habit of explain the voic by appeal to natur law is at the veri root of modern scienc in the live breath cosmos there is a mysteri someth too wonder too aw for ani mind to understand the believ man doe not claim to understand he fall to his knee and whisper god the man of earth kneel also but not to worship he kneel to examin to search to find the caus and the how of thing just now we happen to be live in a secular age our thought habit are those of the scientist not those of the worshipp we are more like to explain than to ador it thunder we exclaim and go our earth way but still the voic sound and search the order and life of the world depend upon that voic but men are most too busi or too stubborn to give attent everyon of us has had experi which we have not been abl to explain a sudden sens of loneli or a feel of wonder or awe in the face of the univers vast or we have had a fleet visit of light like an illumin from some other sun give us in a quick flash an assur that we are from anoth world that our origin are divin what we saw there or felt or heard may have been contrari to all that we had been taught in the school and at wide varianc with all our former belief and opinion we were forc to suspend our acquir doubt while for a moment the cloud were roll back and we saw and heard for ourselv explain such thing as we will i think we have not been fair to the fact until we allow at least the possibl that such experi may aris from the presenc of god in the world and his persist effort to communic with mankind let us not dismiss such an hypothesi too flippant it is my own belief and here i shall not feel bad if no one follow me that everi good and beauti thing which man has produc in the world has been the result of his faulti and sin block respons to the creativ voic sound over the earth the moral philosoph who dream their high dream of virtu the religi thinker who specul about god and immort the poet and artist who creat out of common stuff pure and last beauti how can we explain them it is not enough to say simpli it was genius what then is genius could it be that a genius is a man haunt by the speak voic labor and strive like one possess to achiev end which he onli vagu understand that the great man may have miss god in his labor that he may even have spoken or written against god doe not destroy the idea i am advanc god redempt revel in the holi scriptur is necessari to save faith and peac with god faith in a risen saviour is necessari if the vagu stir toward immort are to bring us to rest and satisfi communion with god to me this is a plausibl explan of all that is best out of christ but you can be a good christian and not accept my thesi the voic of god is a friend voic no one need fear to listen to it unless he has alreadi made up his mind to resist it the blood of jesus has cover not onli the human race but all creation as well and have made peac through the blood of his cross by him to reconcil all thing unto himself by him i say whether they be thing in earth or thing in heaven we may safe preach a friend heaven the heaven as well as the earth are fill with the good will of him that dwelt in the bush the perfect blood of aton secur this forev whoever will listen will hear the speak heaven this is definit not the hour when men take kind to an exhort to listen for listen is not today a part of popular religion we are at the opposit end of the pole from there religion has accept the monstrous heresi that nois size activ and bluster make a man dear to god but we may take heart to a peopl caught in the tempest of the last great conflict god say be still and know that i am god and still he say it as if he mean to tell us that our strength and safeti lie not in nois but in silenc it is import that we get still to wait on god and it is best that we get alon prefer with our bibl outspread befor us then if we will we may draw near to god and begin to hear him speak to us in our heart i think for the averag person the progress will be someth like this first a sound as of a presenc walk in the garden then a voic more intellig but still far from clear then the happi moment when the spirit begin to illumin the scriptur and that which had been onli a sound or at best a voic now becom an intellig word warm and intim and clear as the word of a dear friend then will come life and light and best of all abil to see and rest in and embrac jesus christ as saviour and lord and all the bibl will never be a live book to us until we are convinc that god is articul in his univers to jump from a dead imperson world to a dogmat bibl is too much for most peopl they may admit that they should accept the bibl as the word of god and they may tri to think of it as such but they find it imposs to believ that the word there on the page are actual for them a man may say these word are address to me and yet in his heart not feel and know that they are he is the victim of a divid psycholog he tri to think of god as mute everywher els and vocal onli in a book i believ that much of our religi unbelief is due to a wrong concept of and a wrong feel for the scriptur of truth a silent god sudden began to speak in a book and when the book was finish laps back into silenc again forev now we read the book as the record of what god said when he was for a brief time in a speak mood with notion like that in our head how can we believ the fact are that god is not silent has never been silent it is the natur of god to speak the second person of the holi triniti is call the word the bibl is the inevit outcom of god continu speech it is the infal declar of his mind for us put into our familiar human word i think a new world will aris out of the religi mist when we approach our bibl with the idea that it is not onli a book which was onc spoken but a book which is now speak the prophet habitu said thus saith the lord they meant their hearer to understand that god speak is in the continu present we may use the past tens proper to indic that at a certain time a certain word of god was spoken but a word of god onc spoken continu to be spoken as a child onc born continu to be aliv or a world onc creat continu to exist and those are but imperfect illustr for children die and world burn out but the word of our god endureth forev if you would follow on to know the lord come at onc to the open bibl expect it to speak to you do not come with the notion that it is a thing which you may push around at your conveni it is more than a thing it is a voic a word the veri word of the live god lord teach me to listen the time are noisi and my ear are weari with the thousand raucous sound which continu assault them give me the spirit of the boy samuel when he said to thee speak for thi servant heareth let me hear thee speak in my heart let me get use to the sound of thi voic that it tone may be familiar when the sound of earth die away and the onli sound will be the music of thi speak voic amen vii the gaze of the soul look unto jesus the author and finish of our faithheb 122 let us think of our intellig plain man mention in chapter six come for the first time to the read of the scriptur he approach the bibl without ani previous knowledg of what it contain he is wholli without prejudic he has noth to prove and noth to defend such a man will not have read long until his mind begin to observ certain truth stand out from the page they are the spiritu principl behind the record of god deal with men and woven into the write of holi men as they were move by the holi ghost as he read on he might want to number these truth as they becom clear to him and make a brief summari under each number these summari will be the tenet of his biblic creed further read will not affect these point except to enlarg and strengthen them our man is find out what the bibl actual teach high up on the list of thing which the bibl teach will be the doctrin of faith the place of weighti import which the bibl give to faith will be too plain for him to miss he will veri like conclud faith is all import in the life of the soul without faith it is imposs to pleas god faith will get me anyth take me anywher in the kingdom of god but without faith there can be no approach to god no forgiv no deliver no salvat no communion no spiritu life at all by the time our friend has reach the eleventh chapter of hebrew the eloqu encomium which is there pronounc upon faith will not seem strang to him he will have read paul power defens of faith in his roman and galatian epistl later if he goe on to studi church histori he will understand the amaz power in the teach of the reform as they show the central place of faith in the christian religion now if faith is so vital import if it is an indispens must in our pursuit of god it is perfect natur that we should be deepli concern over whether or not we possess this most precious gift and our mind be what they are it is inevit that sooner or later we should get around to inquir after the natur of faith what is faith would lie close to the question do i have faith and would demand an answer if it were anywher to be found almost all who preach or write on the subject of faith have much the same thing to say concern it they tell us that it is believ a promis that it is take god at his word that it is reckon the bibl to be true and step out upon it the rest of the book or sermon is usual taken up with stori of person who have had their prayer answer as a result of their faith these answer are most direct gift of a practic and tempor natur such as health money physic protect or success in busi or if the teacher is of a philosoph turn of mind he may take anoth cours and lose us in a welter of metaphys or snow us under with psycholog jargon as he defin and re defin pare the slender hair of faith thinner and thinner till it disappear in gossam shave at last when he is finish we get up disappoint and go out by that same door where in we went sure there must be someth better than this in the scriptur there is practic no effort made to defin faith outsid of a brief fourteen word definit in hebrew 111 i know of no biblic definit and even there faith is defin function not philosoph that is it is a statement of what faith is in oper not what it is in essenc it assum the presenc of faith and show what it result in rather than what it is we will be wise to go just that far and attempt to go no further we are told from whenc it come and by what mean faith is a gift of god and faith cometh by hear and hear by the word of god this much is clear and to paraphras thoma Ã  kempi i had rather exercis faith than know the definit thereof from here on when the word faith is or their equival occur in this chapter i ask that they be understood to refer to what faith is in oper as exercis by a believ man right here we drop the notion of definit and think about faith as it may be experienc in action the complexion of our thought will be practic not theoret in a dramat stori in the book of number faith is seen in action israel becam discourag and spoke against god and the lord sent fieri serpent among them and they bit the peopl and much peopl of israel die then mose sought the lord for them and he heard and gave them a remedi against the bite of the serpent he command mose to make a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole in sight of all the peopl and it shall come to pass that everyon that is bitten when he looketh upon it shall live mose obey and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten ani man when he beheld the serpent of brass he live num 214 9 in the new testament this import bit of histori is interpret for us by no less an author than our lord jesus christ himself he is explain to his hearer how they may be save he tell them that it is by believ then to make it clear he refer to this incid in the book of number as mose lift up the serpent in the wilder even so must the son of man be lift up that whosoev believeth in him should not perish but have etern life john 314 15 our plain man in read this would make an import discoveri he would notic that look and believ were synonym term look on the old testament serpent is ident with believ on the new testament christ that is the look and the believ are the same thing and he would understand that while israel look with their extern eye believ is done with the heart i think he would conclud that faith is the gaze of a soul upon a save god when he had seen this he would rememb passag he had read befor and their mean would come flood over him they look unto him and were lighten and their face were not asham psa 345 unto thee lift i up mine eye o thou that dwellest in the heaven behold as the eye of servant look unto the hand of their master and as the eye of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress so our eye wait upon the lord our god until that he have merci upon us psa 1231 2 here the man seek merci look straight at the god of merci and never take his eye away from him till merci is grant and our lord himself look alway at god look up to heaven he bless and brake and gave the bread to his discipl matt 1419 inde jesus taught that he wrought his work by alway keep his inward eye upon his father his power lay in his continu look at god john 519 21 in full accord with the few text we have quot is the whole tenor of the inspir word it is sum up for us in the hebrew epistl when we are instruct to run life race look unto jesus the author and finish of our faith from all this we learn that faith is not a onc done act but a continu gaze of the heart at the triun god believ then is direct the heart attent to jesus it is lift the mind to behold the lamb of god and never ceas that behold for the rest of our live at first this may be difficult but it becom easier as we look steadili at his wondrous person quiet and without strain distract may hinder but onc the heart is commit to him after each brief excurs away from him the attent will return again and rest upon him like a wander bird come back to it window i would emphas this one committ this one great volit act which establish the heart intent to gaze forev upon jesus god take this intent for our choic and make what allow he must for the thousand distract which beset us in this evil world he know that we have set the direct of our heart toward jesus and we can know it too and comfort ourselv with the knowledg that a habit of soul is form which will becom after a while a sort of spiritu reflex requir no more conscious effort on our part faith is the least self regard of the virtu it is by it veri natur scarc conscious of it own exist like the eye which see everyth in front of it and never see itself faith is occupi with the object upon which it rest and pay no attent to itself at all while we are look at god we do not see ourselvesbless riddanc the man who has struggl to purifi himself and has had noth but repeat failur will experi real relief when he stop tinker with his soul and look away to the perfect one while he look at christ the veri thing he has so long been tri to do will be get done within him it will be god work in him to will and to do faith is not in itself a meritori act the merit is in the one toward whom it is direct faith is a redirect of our sight a get out of the focus of our own vision and get god into focus sin has twist our vision inward and made it self regard unbelief has put self where god should be and is peril close to the sin of lucif who said i will set my throne abov the throne of god faith look out instead of in and the whole life fall into line all this may seem too simpl but we have no apolog to make to those who would seek to climb into heaven after help or descend into hell god say the word is nigh thee even the word of faith the word induc us to lift up our eye unto the lord and the bless work of faith begin when we lift our inward eye to gaze upon god we are sure to meet friend eye gaze back at us for it is written that the eye of the lord run to and fro throughout all the earth the sweet languag of experi is thou god seest me when the eye of the soul look out meet the eye of god look in heaven has begun right here on this earth when all my endeavour is turn toward thee becaus all thi endeavour is turn toward me when i look unto thee alon with all my attent nor ever turn asid the eye of my mind becaus thou dost enfold me with thi constant regard when i direct my love toward thee alon becaus thou who art love self hast turn thee toward me alon and what lord is my life save that embrac wherein thi delightsom sweet doth so love enfold me1 so wrote nichola of cusa four hundr year ago i should like to say more about this old man of god he is not much known today anywher among christian believ and among current fundamentalist he is known not at all i feel that we could gain much from a littl acquaint with men of his spiritu flavor and the school of christian thought which they repres christian literatur to be accept and approv by the evangel leader of our time must follow veri close the same train of thought a kind of parti line from which it is scarc safe to depart a half centuri of this in america has made us smug and content we imit each other with slavish devot and our most strenuous effort are put forth to tri to say the same thing that everyon around us is sayingand yet to find an excus for say it some littl safe variat on the approv theme or if no more at least a new illustr nichola was a true follow of christ a lover of the lord radiant and shine in his devot to the person of jesus his theolog was orthodox but fragrant and sweet as everyth about jesus might proper be expect to be his concept of etern life for instanc is beauti in itself and if i mistak not is nearer in spirit to john 173 than that which is current among us today life etern say nichola is nought other than that bless regard wherewith thou never ceasest to behold me yea even the secret place of my soul with thee to behold is to give life tis unceas to impart sweetest love of thee tis to inflam me to love of thee by love impart and to feed me by inflam and by feed to kindl my yearn and by kindl to make me drink of the dew of glad and by drink to infus in me a fountain of life and by infus to make it increas and endure2 now if faith is the gaze of the heart at god and if this gaze is but the rais of the inward eye to meet the all see eye of god then it follow that it is one of the easiest thing possibl to do it would be like god to make the most vital thing easi and place it within the rang of possibl for the weakest and poorest of us sever conclus may fair be drawn from all this the simplic of it for instanc sinc believ is look it can be done without special equip or religi paraphernalia god has seen to it that the one life and death essenti can never be subject to the capric of accid equip can break down or get lost water can leak away record can be destroy by fire the minist can be delay or the church burn down all these are extern to the soul and are subject to accid or mechan failur but look is of the heart and can be done success by ani man stand up or kneel down or lie in his last agoni a thousand mile from ani church sinc believ is look it can be done ani time no season is superior to anoth season for this sweetest of all act god never made salvat depend upon new moon nor holi day or sabbath a man is not nearer to christ on easter sunday than he is say on saturday august 3 or monday octob 4 as long as christ sit on the mediatori throne everi day is a good day and all day are day of salvat neither doe place matter in this bless work of believ god lift your heart and let it rest upon jesus and you are instant in a sanctuari though it be a pullman berth or a factori or a kitchen you can see god from anywher if your mind is set to love and obey him now someon may ask is not this of which you speak for special person such as monk or minist who have by the natur of their call more time to devot to quiet medit i am a busi worker and have littl time to spend alon i am happi to say that the life i describ is for everyon of god children regardless of call it is in fact happili practic everi day by mani hard work person and is beyond the reach of none mani have found the secret of which i speak and without give much thought to what is go on within them constant practic this habit of inward gaze upon god they know that someth insid their heart see god even when they are compel to withdraw their conscious attent in order to engag in earth affair there is within them a secret communion alway go on let their attent but be releas for a moment from necessari busi and it fli at onc to god again this has been the testimoni of mani christian so mani that even as i state it thus i have a feel that i am quot though from whom or from how mani i cannot possibl know i do not want to leav the impress that the ordinari mean of grace have no valu they most assur have privat prayer should be practic by everi christian long period of bibl medit will purifi our gaze and direct it church attend will enlarg our outlook and increas our love for other servic and work and activ all are good and should be engag in by everi christian but at the bottom of all these thing give mean to them will be the inward habit of behold god a new set of eye so to speak will develop within us enabl us to be look at god while our outward eye are see the scene of this

the creator creatur relat be thou exalt o god abov the heaven let thi glori be abov all the earthpsa 575 it is a truism to say that order in natur depend upon right relationship to achiev harmoni each thing must be in it proper posit relat to each other thing in human life it is not otherwis i have hint befor in these chapter that the caus of all our human miseri is a radic moral disloc an upset in our relat to god and to each other for whatev els the fall may have been it was most certain a sharp chang in man relat to his creator he adopt toward god an alter attitud and by so do destroy the proper creator creatur relat in which unknown to him his true happi lay essenti salvat is the restor of a right relat between man and his creator a bring back to normal of the creator creatur relat a satisfactori spiritu life will begin with a complet chang in relat between god and the sinner not a judici chang mere but a conscious and experienc chang affect the sinner whole natur the aton in jesus blood make such a chang judici possibl and the work of the holi spirit make it emot satisfi the stori of the prodig son perfect illustr this latter phase he had brought a world of troubl upon himself by forsak the posit which he had proper held as son of his father at bottom his restor was noth more than a re establish of the father son relat which had exist from his birth and had been alter temporarili by his act of sin rebellion this stori overlook the legal aspect of redempt but it make beauti clear the experienti aspect of salvat in determin relationship we must begin somewher there must be somewher a fix center against which everyth els is measur where the law of relat doe not enter and we can say is and make no allow such a center is god when god would make his name known to mankind he could find no better word than i am when he speak in the first person he say i am when we speak of him we say he is when we speak to him we say thou art everyon and everyth els measur from that fix point i am that i am say god i chang not as the sailor locat his posit on the sea by shoot the sun so we may get our moral bear by look at god we must begin with god we are right when and onli when we stand in a right posit relat to god and we are wrong so far and so long as we stand in ani other posit much of our difficulti as seek christian stem from our unwilling to take god as he is and adjust our live accord we insist upon tri to modifi him and to bring him nearer to our own imag the flesh whimper against the rigor of god inexor sentenc and beg like agag for a littl merci a littl indulg of it carnal way it is no use we can get a right start onli by accept god as he is and learn to love him for what he is as we go on to know him better we shall find it a sourc of unspeak joy that god is just what he is some of the most raptur moment we know will be those we spend in rever admir of the godhead in those holi moment the veri thought of chang in him will be too pain to endur so let us begin with god back of all abov all befor all is god first in sequenti order abov in rank and station exalt in digniti and honor as the self exist one he gave be to all thing and all thing exist out of him and for him thou art worthi o lord to receiv glori and honour and power for thou hast creat all thing and for thi pleasur they are and were creat everi soul belong to god and exist by his pleasur god be who and what he is and we be who and what we are the onli thinkabl relat between us is one of full lordship on his part and complet submiss on our we owe him everi honor that it is in our power to give him our everlast grief lie in give him anyth less the pursuit of god will embrac the labor of bring our total person into conform to his and this not judici but actual i do not here refer to the act of justif by faith in christ i speak of a voluntari exalt of god to his proper station over us and a will surrend of our whole be to the place of worship submiss which the creator creatur circumst make proper the moment we make up our mind that we are go on with this determin to exalt god over all we step out of the world parad we shall find ourselv out of adjust to the way of the world and increas so as we make progress in the holi way we shall acquir a new viewpoint a new and differ psycholog will be form within us a new power will begin to surpris us by it upsurg and it outgo our break with the world will be the direct outcom of our chang relat to god for the world of fallen men doe not honor god million call themselv by his name it is true and pay some token respect to him but a simpl test will show how littl he is realli honor among them let the averag man be put to the proof on the question of who is abov and his true posit will be expos let him be forc into make a choic between god and money between god and men between god and person ambit god and self god and human love and god will take second place everi time those other thing will be exalt abov howev the man may protest the proof is in the choic he make day after day throughout his life be thou exalt is the languag of victori spiritu experi it is a littl key to unlock the door to great treasur of grace it is central in the life of god in the soul let the seek man reach a place where life and lip join to say continu be thou exalt and a thousand minor problem will be solv at onc his christian life ceas to be the complic thing it had been befor and becom the veri essenc of simplic by the exercis of his will he has set his cours and on that cours he will stay as if guid by an automat pilot if blown off cours for a moment by some advers wind he will sure return again as by a secret bent of the soul the hidden motion of the spirit are work in his favor and the star in their cours fight for him he has met his life problem at it center and everyth els must follow along let no one imagin that he will lose anyth of human digniti by this voluntari sell out of his all to his god he doe not by this degrad himself as a man rather he find his right place of high honor as one made in the imag of his creator his deep disgrac lay in his moral derang his unnatur usurp of the place of god his honor will be prove by restor again that stolen throne in exalt god over all he find his own highest honor upheld anyon who might feel reluct to surrend his will to the will of anoth should rememb jesus word whosoev committeth sin is the servant of sin we must of necess be servant to someon either to god or to sin the sinner pride himself on his independ complet overlook the fact that he is the weak slave of the sin that rule his member the man who surrend to christ exchang a cruel slave driver for a kind and gentl master whose yoke is easi and whose burden is light made as we were in the imag of god we scarc find it strang to take again our god as our all god was our origin habitat and our heart cannot but feel at home when they enter again that ancient and beauti abod i hope it is clear that there is a logic behind god claim to pre emin that place is his by everi right in earth or heaven while we take to ourselv the place that is his the whole cours of our live is out of joint noth will or can restor order till our heart make the great decis god shall be exalt abov them that honour me i will honour said god onc to a priest of israel and that ancient law of the kingdom stand today unchang by the pass of time or the chang of dispens the whole bibl and everi page of histori proclaim the perpetu of that law if ani man serv me him will my father honour said our lord jesus tie in the old with the new and reveal the essenti uniti of his way with men sometim the best way to see a thing is to look at it opposit eli and his son are place in the priesthood with the stipul that they honor god in their live and ministr this they fail to do and god send samuel to announc the consequ unknown to eli this law of reciproc honor has been all the while secret work and now the time has come for judgment to fall hophni and phinea the degener priest fall in battl the wife of hophni die in childbirth israel flee befor her enemi the ark of god is captur by the philistin and the old man eli fall backward and die of a broken neck thus stark utter tragedi follow upon eli failur to honor god now set over against this almost ani bibl charact who honest tri to glorifi god in his earth walk see how god wink at weak and overlook failur as he pour upon his servant grace and bless untold let it be abraham jacob david daniel elijah or whom you will honor follow honor as harvest the seed the man of god set his heart to exalt god abov all god accept his intent as fact and act accord not perfect but holi intent made the differ in our lord jesus christ this law was seen in simpl perfect in his lowli manhood he humbl himself and glad gave all glori to his father in heaven he sought not his own honor but the honor of god who sent him if i honour myself he said on one occas my honour is noth it is my father that honoureth me so far had the proud pharise depart from this law that they could not understand one who honor god at his own expens i honour my father said jesus to them and ye do dishonour me anoth say of jesus and a most disturb one was put in the form of a question how can ye believ which receiv honour one of anoth and seek not the honour that cometh from god alon if i understand this correct christ taught here the alarm doctrin that the desir for honor among men made belief imposs is this sin at the root of religi unbelief could it be that those intellectu difficulti which men blame for their inabl to believ are but smoke screen to conceal the real caus that lie behind them was it this greedi desir for honor from man that made men into pharise and pharise into deicid is this the secret back of religi self righteous and empti worship i believ it may be the whole cours of the life is upset by failur to put god where he belong we exalt ourselv instead of god and the curs follow in our desir after god let us keep alway in mind that god also hath desir and his desir is toward the son of men and more particular toward those son of men who will make the onc for all decis to exalt him over all such as these are precious to god abov all treasur of earth or sea in them god find a theater where he can display his exceed kind toward us in christ jesus with them god can walk unhind toward them he can act like the god he is in speak thus i have one fear it is that i may convinc the mind befor god can win the heart for this god abov all posit is one not easi to take the mind may approv it while not have the consent of the will to put it into effect while the imagin race ahead to honor god the will may lag behind and the man never guess how divid his heart is the whole man must make the decis befor the heart can know ani real satisfact god want us all and he will not rest till he get us all no part of the man will do let us pray over this in detail throw ourselv at god feet and mean everyth we say no one who pray thus in sincer need wait long for token of divin accept god will unveil his glori befor his servant eye and he will place all his treasur at the dispos of such a one for he know that his honor is safe in such consecr hand o god be thou exalt over my possess noth of earth treasur shall seem dear unto me if onli thou art glorifi in my life be thou exalt over my friendship i am determin that thou shalt be abov all though i must stand desert and alon in the midst of the earth be thou exalt abov my comfort though it mean the loss of bodili comfort and the carri of heavi cross i shall keep my vow made this day befor thee be thou exalt over my reput make me ambiti to pleas thee even if as a result i must sink into obscur and my name be forgotten as a dream rise o lord into thi proper place of honor abov my ambit abov my like and dislik abov my famili my health and even my life itself let me decreas that thou mayest increas let me sink that thou mayest rise abov ride forth upon me as thou didst ride into jerusalem mount upon the humbl littl beast a colt the foal of an ass and let me hear the children cri to thee hosanna in the highest ix meek and rest bless are the meek for they shall inherit the earthmatt 55 a fair accur descript of the human race might be furnish one unacquaint with it by take the beatitud turn them wrong side out and say here is your human race for the exact opposit of the virtu in the beatitud are the veri qualiti which distinguish human life and conduct in the world of men we find noth approach the virtu of which jesus spoke in the open word of the famous sermon on the mount instead of poverti of spirit we find the rankest kind of pride instead of mourner we find pleasur seeker instead of meek arrog instead of hunger after righteous we hear men say i am rich and increas with good and have need of noth instead of merci we find cruelti instead of puriti of heart corrupt imagin instead of peacemak we find men quarrelsom and resent instead of rejoic in mistreat we find them fight back with everi weapon at their command of this kind of moral stuff civil societi is compos the atmospher is charg with it we breath it with everi breath and drink it with our mother milk cultur and educ refin these thing slight but leav them basic untouch a whole world of literatur has been creat to justifi this kind of life as the onli normal one and this is the more to be wonder at see that these are the evil which make life the bitter struggl it is for all of us all our heartach and a great mani of our physic ill spring direct out of our sin pride arrog resent evil imagin malic greed these are the sourc of more human pain than all the diseas that ever afflict mortal flesh into a world like this the sound of jesus word come wonder and strang a visit from abov it is well that he spoke for no one els could have done it as well and it is good that we listen his word are the essenc of truth he is not offer an opinion jesus never utter opinion he never guess he knew and he know his word are not as solomon were the sum of sound wisdom or the result of keen observ he spoke out of the ful of his godhead and his word are veri truth itself he is the onli one who could say bless with complet author for he is the bless one come from the world abov to confer blessed upon mankind and his word were support by deed mightier than ani perform on this earth by ani other man it is wisdom for us to listen as was often so with jesus he use this word meek in a brief crisp sentenc and not till some time later did he go on to explain it in the same book of matthew he tell us more about it and appli it to our live come unto me all ye that labour and are heavi laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowli in heart and ye shall find rest unto your soul for my yoke is easi and my burden is light here we have two thing stand in contrast to each other a burden and a rest the burden is not a local one peculiar to those first hearer but one which is born by the whole human race it consist not of polit oppress or poverti or hard work it is far deeper than that it is felt by the rich as well as the poor for it is someth from which wealth and idl can never deliv us the burden born by mankind is a heavi and a crush thing the word jesus use mean a load carri or toil born to the point of exhaust rest is simpli releas from that burden it is not someth we do it is what come to us when we ceas to do his own meek that is the rest let us examin our burden it is altogeth an interior one it attack the heart and the mind and reach the bodi onli from within first there is the burden of pride the labor of self love is a heavi one inde think for yourself whether much of your sorrow has not arisen from someon speak slight of you as long as you set yourself up as a littl god to which you must be loyal there will be those who will delight to offer affront to your idol how then can you hope to have inward peac the heart fierc effort to protect itself from everi slight to shield it touchi honor from the bad opinion of friend and enemi will never let the mind have rest continu this fight through the year and the burden will becom intoler yet the son of earth are carri this burden continu challeng everi word spoken against them cring under everi critic smart under each fanci slight toss sleepless if anoth is prefer befor them such a burden as this is not necessari to bear jesus call us to his rest and meek is his method the meek man care not at all who is greater than he for he has long ago decid that the esteem of the world is not worth the effort he develop toward himself a kind sens of humor and learn to say oh so you have been overlook they have place someon els befor you they have whisper that you are pretti small stuff after all and now you feel hurt becaus the world is say about you the veri thing you have been say about yourself onli yesterday you were tell god that you were noth a mere worm of the dust where is your consist come on humbl yourself and ceas to care what men think the meek man is not a human mous afflict with a sens of his own inferior rather he may be in his moral life as bold as a lion and as strong as samson but he has stop be fool about himself he has accept god estim of his own life he know he is as weak and helpless as god has declar him to be but paradox he know at the same time that he is in the sight of god of more import than angel in himself noth in god everyth that is his motto he know well that the world will never see him as god see him and he has stop care he rest perfect content to allow god to place his own valu he will be patient to wait for the day when everyth will get it own price tag and real worth will come into it own then the righteous shall shine forth in the kingdom of their father he is will to wait for that day in the meantim he will have attain a place of soul rest as he walk on in meek he will be happi to let god defend him the old struggl to defend himself is over he has found the peac which meek bring then also he will get deliver from the burden of pretens by this i mean not hypocrisi but the common human desir to put the best foot forward and hide from the world our real inward poverti for sin has play mani evil trick upon us and one has been the infus into us a fals sens of shame there is hard a man or woman who dare to be just what he or she is without doctor up the impress the fear of be found out gnaw like rodent within their heart the man of cultur is haunt by the fear that he will some day come upon a man more cultur than himself the learn man fear to meet a man more learn than he the rich man sweat under the fear that his cloth or his car or his hous will sometim be made to look cheap by comparison with those of anoth rich man so call societi run by a motiv not higher than this and the poorer class on their level are littl better let no one smile this off these burden are real and littl by littl they kill the victim of this evil and unnatur way of life and the psycholog creat by year of this kind of thing make true meek seem as unreal as a dream as aloof as a star to all the victim of the gnaw diseas jesus say ye must becom as littl children for littl children do not compar they receiv direct enjoy from what they have without relat it to someth els or someon els onli as they get older and sin begin to stir within their heart do jealousi and envi appear then they are unabl to enjoy what they have if someon els has someth larger or better at that earli age doe the gall burden come down upon their tender soul and it never leav them till jesus set them free anoth sourc of burden is artifici i am sure that most peopl live in secret fear that some day they will be careless and by chanc an enemi or friend will be allow to peep into their poor empti soul so they are never relax bright peopl are tens and alert in fear that they may be trap into say someth common or stupid travel peopl are afraid that they may meet some marco polo who is abl to describ some remot place where they have never been this unnatur condit is part of our sad heritag of sin but in our day it is aggrav by our whole way of life advertis is larg base upon this habit of pretens cours are offer in this or that field of human learn frank appeal to the victim desir to shine at a parti book are sold cloth and cosmet are peddl by play continu upon this desir to appear what we are not artifici is one curs that will drop away the moment we kneel at jesus feet and surrend ourselv to his meek then we will not care what peopl think of us so long as god is pleas then what we are will be everyth what we appear will take it place far down the scale of interest for us apart from sin we have noth of which to be asham onli an evil desir to shine make us want to appear other than we are the heart of the world is break under this load of pride and pretens there is no releas from our burden apart from the meek of christ good keen reason may help slight but so strong is this vice that if we push it down one place it will come up somewher els to men and women everywher jesus say come unto me and i will give you rest the rest he offer is the rest of meek the bless relief which come when we accept ourselv for what we are and ceas to pretend it will take some courag at first but the need grace will come as we learn that we are share this new and easi yoke with the strong son of god himself he call it my yoke and he walk at one end while we walk at the other lord make me childlik deliv me from the urg to compet with anoth for place or prestig or posit i would be simpl and artless as a littl child deliv me from pose and pretens forgiv me for think of myself help me to forget myself and find my true peac in behold thee that thou mayest answer this prayer i humbl myself befor thee lay upon me thi easi yoke of self forget that through it i may find rest amen x the sacrament of live whether therefor ye eat or drink or whatsoev ye do do all to the glori of godi cor 1031 one of the greatest hindranc to intern peac which the christian encount is the common habit of divid our live into two area the sacr and the secular as these area are conceiv to exist apart from each other and to be moral and spiritu incompat and as we are compel by the necess of live to be alway cross back and forth from the one to the other our inner live tend to break up so that we live a divid instead of a unifi life our troubl spring from the fact that we who follow christ inhabit at onc two world the spiritu and the natur as children of adam we live our live on earth subject to the limit of the flesh and the weak and ill to which human natur is heir mere to live among men requir of us year of hard toil and much care and attent to the thing of this world in sharp contrast to this is our life in the spirit there we enjoy anoth and higher kind of life we are children of god we possess heaven status and enjoy intim fellowship with christ this tend to divid our total life into two depart we come unconsci to recogn two set of action the first are perform with a feel of satisfact and a firm assur that they are pleas to god these are the sacr act and they are usual thought to be prayer bibl read hymn sing church attend and such other act as spring direct from faith they may be known by the fact that they have no direct relat to this world and would have no mean whatev except as faith show us anoth world an hous not made with hand etern in the heaven over against these sacr act are the secular one they includ all of the ordinari activ of life which we share with the son and daughter of adam eat sleep work look after the need of the bodi and perform our dull and prosaic duti here on earth these we often do reluct and with mani misgiv often apolog to god for what we consid a wast of time and strength the upshot of this is that we are uneasi most of the time we go about our common task with a feel of deep frustrat tell ourselv pensiv that there a better day come when we shall slough off this earth shell and be bother no more with the affair of this world this is the old sacr secular antithesi most christian are caught in it trap they cannot get a satisfactori adjust between the claim of the two world they tri to walk the tight rope between two kingdom and they find no peac in either their strength is reduc their outlook confus and their joy taken from them i believ this state of affair to be wholli unnecessari we have gotten ourselv on the horn of a dilemma true enough but the dilemma is not real it is a creatur of misunderstand the sacr secular antithesi has no foundat in the new testament without doubt a more perfect understand of christian truth will deliv us from it the lord jesus christ himself is our perfect exampl and he knew no divid life in the presenc of his father he live on earth without strain from babyhood to his death on the cross god accept the offer of his total life and made no distinct between act and act i do alway the thing that pleas him was his brief summari of his own life as it relat to the father as he move among men he was pois and rest what pressur and suffer he endur grew out of his posit as the world sin bearer they were never the result of moral uncertainti or spiritu maladjust paul exhort to do all to the glori of god is more than pious ideal it is an integr part of the sacr revel and is to be accept as the veri word of truth it open befor us the possibl of make everi act of our live contribut to the glori of god lest we should be too timid to includ everyth paul mention specif eat and drink this humbl privileg we share with the beast that perish if these lowli anim act can be so perform as to honor god then it becom difficult to conceiv of one that cannot that monkish hatr of the bodi which figur so promin in the work of certain earli devot writer is wholli without support in the word of god common modesti is found in the sacr scriptur it is true but never pruderi or a fals sens of shame the new testament accept as a matter of cours that in his incarn our lord took upon him a real human bodi and no effort is made to steer around the downright implic of such a fact he live in that bodi here among men and never onc perform a non sacr act his presenc in human flesh sweep away forev the evil notion that there is about the human bodi someth innat offens to the deiti god creat our bodi and we do not offend him by place the respons where it belong he is not asham of the work of his own hand pervers misus and abus of our human power should give us caus enough to be asham bodili act done in sin and contrari to natur can never honor god wherev the human will introduc moral evil we have no longer our innoc and harmless power as god made them we have instead an abus and twist thing which can never bring glori to it creator let us howev assum that pervers and abus are not present let us think of a christian believ in whose life the twin wonder of repent and the new birth have been wrought he is now live accord to the will of god as he understand it from the written word of such a one it may be said that everi act of his life is or can be as truli sacr as prayer or baptism or the lord supper to say this is not to bring all act down to one dead level it is rather to lift everi act up into a live kingdom and turn the whole life into a sacrament if a sacrament is an extern express of an inward grace than we need not hesit to accept the abov thesi by one act of consecr of our total selv to god we can make everi subsequ act express that consecr we need no more be asham of our bodyth flesh servant that carri us through lifethan jesus was of the humbl beast upon which he rode into jerusalem the lord hath need of him may well appli to our mortal bodi if christ dwell in us we may bear about the lord of glori as the littl beast did of old and give occas to the multitud to cri hosanna in the highest that we see this truth is not enough if we would escap from the toil of the sacr secular dilemma the truth must run in our blood and condit the complexion of our thought we must practic live to the glori of god actual and determin by medit upon this truth by talk it over with god often in our prayer by recal it to our mind frequent as we move about among men a sens of it wondrous mean will begin to take hold of us the old pain dualiti will go down befor a rest uniti of life the knowledg that we are all god that he has receiv all and reject noth will unifi our inner live and make everyth sacr to us this is not quit all long held habit do not die easili it will take intellig thought and a great deal of rever prayer to escap complet from the sacr secular psycholog for instanc it may be difficult for the averag christian to get hold of the idea that his daili labor can be perform as act of worship accept to god by jesus christ the old antithesi will crop up in the back of his head sometim to disturb his peac of mind nor will that old serpent the devil take all this lie down he will be there in the cab or at the desk or in the field to remind the christian that he is give the better part of his day to the thing of this world and allot to his religi duti onli a trifl portion of his time and unless great care is taken this will creat confus and bring discourag and heavi of heart we can meet this success onli by the exercis of an aggress faith we must offer all our act to god and believ that he accept them then hold firm to that posit and keep insist that everi act of everi hour of the day and night be includ in the transact keep remind god in our time of privat prayer that we mean everi act for his glori then supplement those time by a thousand thought prayer as we go about the job of live let us practic the fine art of make everi work a priest ministr let us believ that god is in all our simpl deed and learn to find him there a concomit of the error which we have been discuss is the sacr secular antithesi as appli to place it is littl short of astonish that we can read the new testament and still believ in the inher sacred of place as distinguish from other place this error is so widespread that one feel all alon when he tri to combat it it has act as a kind of dye to color the think of religi person and has color the eye as well so that it is all but imposs to detect it fallaci in the face of everi new testament teach to the contrari it has been said and sung throughout the centuri and accept as a part of the christian messag the which it most sure is not onli the quaker so far as my knowledg goe have had the percept to see the error and the courag to expos it here are the fact as i see them for four hundr year israel had dwelt in egypt surround by the crassest idolatri by the hand of mose they were brought out at last and start toward the land of promis the veri idea of holi had been lost to them to correct this god began at the bottom he local himself in the cloud and fire and later when the tabernacl had been built he dwelt in fieri manifest in the holi of holi by innumer distinct god taught israel the differ between holi and unholi there were holi day holi vessel holi garment there were wash sacrific offer of mani kind by these mean israel learn that god is holi it was this that he was teach them not the holi of thing or place but the holi of jehovah was the lesson they must learn then came the great day when christ appear immedi he began to say ye have heard that it was said by them of old timebut i say unto you the old testament school was over when christ die on the cross the veil of the templ was rent from top to bottom the holi of holi was open to everyon who would enter in faith christ word were rememb the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipp shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth short after paul took up the cri of liberti and declar all meat clean everi day holi all place sacr and everi act accept to god the sacred of time and place a half light necessari to the educ of the race pass away befor the full sun of spiritu worship the essenti spiritu of worship remain the possess of the church until it was slowli lost with the pass of the year then the natur legal of the fallen heart of men began to introduc the old distinct the church came to observ again day and season and time certain place were chosen and mark out as holi in a special sens differ were observ between one and anoth day or place or person the sacrament were first two then three then four until with the triumph of roman they were fix at seven in all chariti and with no desir to reflect unkind upon ani christian howev misl i would point out that the roman cathol church repres today the sacr secular heresi carri to it logic conclus it deadliest effect is the complet cleavag it introduc between religion and life it teacher attempt to avoid this snare by mani footnot and multitudin explan but the mind instinct for logic is too strong in practic live the cleavag is a fact from this bondag reform and puritan and mystic have labor to free us today the trend in conserv circl is back toward that bondag again it is said that a hors after it has been led out of a burn build will sometim by a strang obstinaci break loos from it rescuer and dash back into the build again to perish in the flame by some such stubborn tendenc toward error fundament in our day is move back toward spiritu slaveri the observ of day and time is becom more and more promin among us lent and holi week and good friday are word heard more and more frequent upon the lip of gospel christian we do not know when we are well off in order that i may be understood and not be misunderstood i would throw into relief the practic implic of the teach for which i have been argu ie the sacrament qualiti of everi day live over against it posit mean i should like to point out a few thing it doe not mean it doe not mean for instanc that everyth we do is of equal import with everyth els we do or may do one act of a good man life may differ wide from anoth in import paul sew of tent was not equal to his write of an epistl to the roman but both were accept of god and both were true act of worship certain it is more import to lead a soul to christ than to plant a garden but the plant of the garden can be as holi an act as the win of a soul again it doe not mean that everi man is as use as everi other man gift differ in the bodi of christ a billi bray is not to be compar with a luther or a wesley for sheer use to the church and to the world but the servic of the less gift brother is as pure as that of the more gift and god accept both with equal pleasur the layman need never think of his humbler task as be inferior to that of his minist let everi man abid in the call wherein he is call and his work will be as sacr as the work of the ministri it is not what a man doe that determin whether his work is sacr or secular it is whi he doe it the motiv is everyth let a man sanctifi the lord god in his heart and he can thereaft do no common act all he doe is good and accept to god through jesus christ for such a man live itself will be sacrament and the whole world a sanctuari his entir life will be a priest ministr as he perform his never so simpl task he will hear the voic of the seraphim say holi holi holi is the lord of host the whole earth is full of his glori lord i would trust thee complet i would be altogeth thine i would exalt thee abov all i desir that i may feel no sens of possess anyth outsid of thee i want constant to be awar of thi overshadow presenc and to hear thi speak voic i long to live in rest sincer of heart i want to live so fulli in the spirit that all my thought may be as sweet incens ascend to thee and everi act of my life may be an act of worship therefor i pray in the word of thi great servant of old i beseech thee so for to cleans the intent of mine heart with the unspeak gift of thi grace that i may perfect love thee and worthili prais thee and all this i confid believ thou wilt grant me through the merit of jesus christ thi son amen
