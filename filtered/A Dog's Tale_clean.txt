my mother had a fond for such she like to say them and see other dog look surpris and envious as wonder how she got so much educ but inde it was not real educ it was onli show she got the word by listen in the dine room and draw room when there was compani and by go with the children to sunday school and listen there and whenev she heard a larg word she said it over to herself mani time and so was abl to keep it until there was a dogmat gather in the neighborhood then she would get it off and surpris and distress them all from pocket pup to mastiff which reward her for all her troubl if there was a stranger he was near sure to be suspici and when he got his breath again he would ask her what it meant and she alway told him he was never expect this but thought he would catch her so when she told him he was the one that look asham wherea he had thought it was go to be she the other were alway wait for this and glad of it and proud of her for they knew what was go to happen becaus they had had experi when she told the mean of a big word they were all so taken up with admir that it never occur to ani dog to doubt if it was the right one and that was natur becaus for one thing she answer up so prompt that it seem like a dictionari speak and for anoth thing where could they find out whether it was right or not for she was the onli cultiv dog there was by and by when i was older she brought home the word unintellectu one time and work it pretti hard all the week at differ gather make much unhappi and despond and it was at this time that i notic that dure that week she was ask for the mean at eight differ assemblag and flash out a fresh definit everi time which show me that she had more presenc of mind than cultur though i said noth of cours she had one word which she alway kept on hand and readi like a life preserv a kind of emerg word to strap on when she was like to get wash overboard in a sudden waythat was the word synonym when she happen to fetch out a long word which had had it day week befor and it prepar mean gone to her dump pile if there was a stranger there of cours it knock him groggi for a coupl of minut then he would come to and by that time she would be away down wind on anoth tack and not expect anyth so when hed hail and ask her to cash in i the onli dog on the insid of her game could see her canva flicker a momentbut onli just a momentthen it would belli out taut and full and she would say as calm as a summer day it synonym with supererog or some godless long reptil of a word like that and go placid about and skim away on the next tack perfect comfort you know and leav that stranger look profan and embarrass and the initi slat the floor with their tail in unison and their face transfigur with a holi joy and it was the same with phrase she would drag home a whole phrase if it had a grand sound and play it six night and two matine and explain it a new way everi timewhich she had to for all she care for was the phrase she wasnt interest in what it meant and knew those dog hadnt wit enough to catch her anyway yes she was a daisi she got so she wasnt afraid of anyth she had such confid in the ignor of those creatur she even brought anecdot that she had heard the famili and the dinner guest laugh and shout over and as a rule she got the nub of one chestnut hitch onto anoth chestnut where of cours it didnt fit and hadnt ani point and when she deliv the nub she fell over and roll on the floor and laugh and bark in the most insan way while i could see that she was wonder to herself whi it didnt seem as funni as it did when she first heard it but no harm was done the other roll and bark too privat asham of themselv for not see the point and never suspect that the fault was not with them and there wasnt ani to see you can see by these thing that she was of a rather vain and frivol charact still she had virtu and enough to make up i think she had a kind heart and gentl way and never harbor resent for injuri done her but put them easili out of her mind and forgot them and she taught her children her kind way and from her we learn also to be brave and prompt in time of danger and not to run away but face the peril that threaten friend or stranger and help him the best we could without stop to think what the cost might be to us and she taught us not by word onli but by exampl and that is the best way and the surest and the most last whi the brave thing she did the splendid thing she was just a soldier and so modest about itwel you couldnt help admir her and you couldnt help imit her not even a king charl spaniel could remain entir despic in her societi so as you see there was more to her than her educ chapter ii when i was well grown at last i was sold and taken away and i never saw her again she was broken heart and so was i and we cri but she comfort me as well as she could and said we were sent into this world for a wise and good purpos and must do our duti without repin take our life as we might find it live it for the best good of other and never mind about the result they were not our affair she said men who did like this would have a nobl and beauti reward by and by in anoth world and although we anim would not go there to do well and right without reward would give to our brief live a worthi and digniti which in itself would be a reward she had gather these thing from time to time when she had gone to the sunday school with the children and had laid them up in her memori more care than she had done with those other word and phrase and she had studi them deepli for her good and our one may see by this that she had a wise and thought head for all there was so much light and vaniti in it so we said our farewel and look our last upon each other through our tear and the last thing she saidkeep it for the last to make me rememb it the better i thinkwa in memori of me when there is a time of danger to anoth do not think of yourself think of your mother and do as she would do do you think i could forget that no chapter iii it was such a charm homemi new one a fine great hous with pictur and delic decor and rich furnitur and no gloom anywher but all the wilder of dainti color lit up with flood sunshin and the spacious ground around it and the great gardenoh greensward and nobl tree and flower no end and i was the same as a member of the famili and they love me and pet me and did not give me a new name but call me by my old one that was dear to me becaus my mother had given it meaileen mavourneen she got it out of a song and the gray knew that song and said it was a beauti name mrs gray was thirti and so sweet and so love you cannot imagin it and sadi was ten and just like her mother just a darl slender littl copi of her with auburn tail

thirti eight and tall and slender and handsom a littl bald in front alert quick in his movement busi like prompt decid unsentiment and with that kind of trim chisel face that just seem to glint and sparkl with frosti intellectu he was a renown scientist i do not know what the word mean but my mother would know how to use it and get effect she would know how to depress a rat terrier with it and make a lap dog look sorri he came but that is not the best one the best one was laboratori my mother could organ a trust on that one that would skin the tax collar off the whole herd the laboratori was not a book or a pictur or a place to wash your hand in as the colleg presid dog saidno that is the lavatori the laboratori is quit differ and is fill with jar and bottl and electr and wire and strang machin and everi week other scientist came there and sat in the place and use the machin and discuss and made what they call experi and discoveri and often i came too and stood around and listen and tri to learn for the sake of my mother and in love memori of her although it was a pain to me as realiz what she was lose out of her life and i gain noth at all for tri as i might i was never abl to make anyth out of it at all other time i lay on the floor in the mistresss work room and slept she gentl use me for a foot stool know it pleas me for it was a caress other time i spent an hour in the nurseri and got well tousl and made happi other time i watch by the crib there when the babi was asleep and the nurs out for a few minut on the babi affair other time i romp and race through the ground and the garden with sadi till we were tire out then slumber on the grass in the shade of a tree while she read her book other time i went visit among the neighbor dogsfor there were some most pleasant one not far away and one veri handsom and courteous and grace one a cur hair irish setter by the name of robin adair who was a presbyterian like me and belong to the scotch minist the servant in our hous were all kind to me and were fond of me and so as you see mine was a pleasant life there could not be a happier dog that i was nor a grateful one i will say this for myself for it is onli the truth i tri in all way to do well and right and honor my mother memori and her teach and earn the happi that had come to me as best i could by and by came my littl puppi and then my cup was full my happi was perfect it was the dearest littl waddl thing and so smooth and soft and velveti and had such cun littl awkward paw and such affection eye and such a sweet and innoc face and it made me so proud to see how the children and their mother ador it and fondl it and exclaim over everi littl wonder thing it did it did seem to me that life was just too love to then came the winter one day i was stand a watch in the nurseri that is to say i was asleep on the bed the babi was asleep in the crib which was alongsid the bed on the side next the fireplac it was the kind of crib that has a lofti tent over it made of gauzi stuff that you can see through the nurs was out and we two sleeper were alon a spark from the wood fire was shot out and it lit on the slope of the tent i suppos a quiet interv follow then a scream from the babi awok me and there was that tent flame up toward the ceil befor i could think i sprang to the floor in my fright and in a second was half way to the door but in the next half second my mother farewel was sound in my ear and i was back on the bed again i reach my head through the flame and drag the babi out by the waist band and tug it along and we fell to the floor togeth in a cloud of smoke i snatch a new hold and drag the scream littl creatur along and out at the door and around the bend of the hall and was still tug away all excit and happi and proud when the master voic shout begon you curs beast and i jump to save myself but he was furious quick and chase me up strike furious at me with his cane i dodg this way and that in terror and at last a strong blow fell upon my left foreleg which made me shriek and fall for the moment helpless the cane went up for anoth blow but never descend for the nurs voic rang wild out the nurseri on fire and the master rush away in that direct and my other bone were save the pain was cruel but no matter i must not lose ani time he might come back at ani moment so i limp on three leg to the other end of the hall where there was a dark littl stairway lead up into a garret where old box and such thing were kept as i had heard say and where peopl seldom went i manag to climb up there then i search my way through the dark among the pile of thing and hid in the secretest place i could find it was foolish to be afraid there yet still i was so afraid that i held in and hard even whimper though it would have been such a comfort to whimper becaus that eas the pain you know but i could lick my leg and that did some good for half an hour there was a commot downstair and shout and rush footstep and then there was quiet again quiet for some minut and that was grate to my spirit for then my fear began to go down and fear are wors than painsoh much wors then came a sound that froze me they were call mecal me by namehunt for me it was muffl by distanc but that could not take the terror out of it and it was the most dread sound to me that i had ever heard it went all about everywher down there along the hall through all the room in both stori and in the basement and the cellar then outsid and farther and farther awaythen back and all about the hous again and i thought it would never never stop but at last it did hour and hour after the vagu twilight of the garret had long ago been blot out by black dark then in that bless still my terror fell littl by littl away and i was at peac and slept it was a good rest i had but i woke befor the twilight had come again i was feel fair comfort and i could think out a plan now i made a veri good one which was to creep down all the way down the back stair and hide behind the cellar door and slip out and escap when the iceman came at dawn while he was insid fill the refriger then i would hide all day and start on my journey when night came my journey towel anywher where they would not know me and betray me to the master i was feel almost cheer now then sudden i thought whi what would life be without my puppi that was despair there was no plan for me i saw that i must stay where i was stay and wait and take what might comeit was not my affair that was what life ismi mother had said it thenwel then the call began again all my sorrow came back i said to myself the master will never forgiv i did not know what i had done to make him so bitter and so unforgiv yet i judg it was someth a dog could not understand but which was clear to a man and dread they call and calledday and night it seem to me so long that the hunger and thirst near drove me mad and i recogn that i was get veri weak when you are this way you sleep a great deal and i did onc i woke in an aw frightit seem to me that the call was right there in the garret and so it was it was sadi voic and she was cri my name was fall from her lip all broken poor thing and i could not believ my ear for the joy of it when i heard her say come back to usoh come back to us and forgiveit is all so sad without our i broke in with such a grate littl yelp and the next moment sadi was plung and stumbl through the dark and the lumber and shout for the famili to hear shes found shes found the day that followedwel they were wonder the mother and sadi and the servantswhi they just seem to worship me they couldnt seem to make me a bed that was fine enough and as for food they couldnt be satisfi with anyth but game and delicaci that were out of season and everi day the friend and neighbor flock in to hear about my heroismthat was the name they call it by and it mean agricultur i rememb my mother pull it on a kennel onc and explain it in that way but didnt say what agricultur was except that it was synonym with intramur incandesc and a dozen time a day mrs gray and sadi would tell the tale to new comer and say i risk my life to say the babi and both of us had burn to prove it and then the compani would pass me around and pet me and exclaim about me and you could see the pride in the eye of sadi and her mother and when the peopl want to know what made me limp they look asham and chang the subject and sometim when peopl hunt them this way and that way with question about it it look to me as if they were go to cri and this was not all the glori no the master friend came a whole twenti of the most distinguish peopl and had me in the laboratori and discuss me as if i was a kind of discoveri and some of them said it was wonder in a dumb beast the finest exhibit of instinct they could call to mind but the master said with vehem it far abov instinct it reason and mani a man privileg to be save and go with you and me to a better world by right of it possess has less of it that this poor silli quadrup that foreordain to perish and then he laugh and said whi look at meim a sarcasm bless you with all my grand intellig the onli thing i infer was that the dog had gone mad and was destroy the child wherea but for the beast intelligenceit reason i tell youth child would have perish they disput and disput and i was the veri center of subject of it all and i wish my mother could know that this grand honor had come to me it would have made her proud then they discuss optic as they call it and whether a certain injuri to the brain would produc blind or not but they could not agre about it and said they must test it by experi by and by and next they discuss plant and that interest me becaus in the summer sadi and i had plant seedsi help her dig the hole you knowand after day and day a littl shrub or a flower came up there and it was a wonder how that could happen but it did and i wish i could talki would have told those peopl about it and shown then how much i knew and been all aliv with the subject but i didnt care for the optic it was dull and when they came back to it again it bore me and i went to sleep pretti soon it was spring and sunni and pleasant and love and the sweet mother and the children pat me and the puppi good by and went away on a journey and a visit to their kin and the master wasnt ani compani for us but we play togeth and had good time and the servant were kind and friend so we got along quit happili and count the day and wait for the famili and one day those men came again and said now for the test and they took the puppi to the laboratori and i limp three leg along too feel proud for ani attent shown to the puppi was a pleasur to me of cours they discuss and experi and then sudden the puppi shriek and they set him on the floor and he went stagger around with his head all bloodi and the master clap his hand and shout there ive wonconfess it hes as blind as a bat and they all said it soyouv prove your theori and suffer human owe you a great debt from henceforth and they crowd around him and wrung his hand cordial and thank and prais him but i hard saw or heard these thing for i ran at onc to my littl darl and snuggl close to it where it lay and lick the blood and it put it head against mine whimper soft and i knew in my heart it was a comfort to it in it pain and troubl to feel it mother touch though it could not see me then it drop down present and it littl velvet nose rest upon the floor and it was still and did not move ani more soon the master stop discuss a moment and rang in the footman and said buri it in the far corner of the garden and then went on with the discuss and i trot after the footman veri happi and grate for i knew the puppi was out of it pain now becaus it was asleep we went far down the garden to the farthest end where the children and the nurs and the puppi and i use to play in the summer in the shade of a great elm and there the footman dug a hole and i saw he was go to plant the puppi and i was glad becaus it would grow and come up a fine handsom dog like robin adair and be a beauti surpris for the famili when they came home so i tri to help him dig but my lame leg was no good be stiff you know and you have to have two or it is no use when the footman had finish and cover littl robin up he pat my head and there were tear in his eye and he said poor littl doggi you save his child i have watch two whole week and he doesnt come up this last week a fright has been steal upon me i think there is someth terribl about this i do not know what it is but the fear make me sick and i cannot eat though the servant bring me the best of food and they pet me so and even come in the night and cri and say poor doggiedo give it up and come home dont break our heart and all this terrifi me the more and make me sure someth has happen and i am so weak sinc yesterday i cannot stand on my feet anymor and within this hour the servant look toward the sun where it was sink out of sight and the night chill come on said thing i could not understand but they carri someth cold to my heart those poor creatur they do not suspect they will come home in the morn and eager ask for the littl doggi that did the brave deed and who of us will be strong enough to say the truth to them the humbl littl friend is gone where
