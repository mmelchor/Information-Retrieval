knew by these sign that they were lost upon dedlow marsh and must make a night of it and a gloomi one at thatthen you might know someth of dedlow marsh at high water let me recal a stori connect with this latter view which never fail to recur to my mind in my long gun excurs upon dedlow marsh although the event was briefli record in the counti paper i had the stori in all it eloqu detail from the lip of the princip actor i cannot hope to catch the vari emphasi and peculiar color of feminin delin for my narrat was a woman but ill tri to give at least it substanc she live midway of the great slough of dedlow marsh and a good size river which debouch four mile beyond into an estuari form by the pacif ocean on the long sandi peninsula which constitut the southwestern boundari of a nobl bay the hous in which she live was a small frame cabin rais from the marsh a few feet by stout pile and was three mile distant from the settlement upon the river her husband was a loggera profit busi in a counti where the princip occup was the manufactur of lumber it was the season of earli spring when her husband left on the ebb of a high tide with a raft of log for the usual transport to the lower end of the bay as she stood by the door of the littl cabin when the voyag depart she notic a cold look in the southeastern sky and she rememb hear her husband say to his companion that they must endeavor to complet their voyag befor the come of the south wester gale which he saw brew and that night it began to storm and blow harder than she had ever befor experienc and some great tree fell in the forest by the river and the hous rock like her babi cradl but howev the storm might roar about the littl cabin she knew that one she trust had driven bolt and bar with his own strong hand and that had he fear for her he would not have left her this and her domest duti and the care of her littl sick babi help to keep her mind from dwell on the weather except of cours to hope that he was safe harbor with the log at utopia in the dreari distanc but she notic that day when she went out to feed the chicken and look after the cow that the tide was up to the littl fenc of their garden patch and the roar of the surf on the south beach though mile away she could hear distinct and she began to think that she would like to have some one to talk with about matter and she believ that if it had not been so far and so stormi and the trail so impass she would have taken the babi and have gone over to ryekman her nearest neighbor but then you see he might have return in the storm all wet with no one to see to him and it was a long exposur for babi who was croupi and ail but that night she never could tell whi she didnt feel like sleep or even lie down the storm had somewhat abat but she still sat and sat and even tri to read i dont know whether it was a bibl or some profan magazin that this poor woman read but most probabl the latter for the word all ran togeth and made such sad nonsens that she was forc at last to put the book down and turn to that dearer volum which lay befor her in the cradl with it white initi leaf as yet unsoil and tri to look forward to it mysteri futur and rock the cradl she thought of everyth and everybodi but still was wide awak as ever it was near twelv oclock when she at last lay down in her cloth how long she slept she could not rememb but she awok with a dread choke in her throat and found herself stand trembl all over in the middl of the room with her babi clasp to her breast and she was say someth the babi cri and sob and she walk up and down tri to hush it when she heard a scratch at the door she open it fear and was glad to see it was onli old pete their dog who crawl drip with water into the room she would have like to look out not in the faint hope of her husband come but to see how thing look but the wind shook the door so savag that she could hard hold it then she sat down a littl while and then walk up and down a littl while and then she lay down again a littl while lie close by the wall of the littl cabin she thought she heard onc or twice someth scrape slowli against the clapboard like the scrape of branch then there was a littl gurgl sound like the babi made when it was swallow then someth went click click and cluck cluck so that she sat up in bed when she did so she was attract by someth els that seem creep from the back door toward the centr of the room it wasnt much wider than her littl finger but soon it swell to the width of her hand and began spread all over the floor it was water she ran to the front door and threw it wide open and saw noth but water she ran to the back door and threw it open and saw noth but water she ran to the side window and throw that open she saw noth but water then she rememb hear her husband onc say that there was no danger in the tide for that fell regular and peopl could calcul on it and that he would rather live near the bay than the river whose bank might overflow at ani time but was it the tide so she ran again to the back door and threw out a stick of wood it drift away toward the bay she scoop up some of the water and put it eager to her lip it was fresh and sweet it was the river and not the tide it was thenoh god be prais for his good she did neither faint nor fall it was thenbless be the saviour for it was his merci hand that touch and strengthen her in this aw momentthat fear drop from her like a garment and her trembl ceas it was then and thereaft that she never lost her self command through all the trial of that gloomi night she drew the bedstead toward the middl of the room and place a tabl upon it and on that she put the cradl the water on the floor was alreadi over her ankl and the hous onc or twice move so percept and seem to be rack so that the closet door all flew open then she heard the same rasp and thump against the wall and look out saw that a larg uproot tree which had lain near the road at the upper end of the pastur had float down to the hous luckili it long root drag in the soil and kept it from move as rapid as the current for had it struck the hous in it full career even the strong nail and bolt in the pile could not have withstood the shock the hound had leap upon it knotti surfac and crouch near the root shiver and whine a ray of hope flash across her mind she drew a heavi blanket from the bed and wrap it about the babe wade in the deepen water to the door as the tree swung again broadsid on make the littl cabin creak and trembl she leap on to it trunk by god merci she succeed in obtain a foot on it slipperi surfac and twine an arm about it root she held in the other her moan child then someth crack near the front porch and the whole front of the hous she had just quit fell forwardjust as cattl fall on their knee befor they lie downand at the same moment the great redwood tree swung round and drift away with it live cargo into the black night for all the excit and danger for all her sooth of her cri babe for all the whistl of the wind for all the uncertainti of her situat she still turn to look at the desert and water swept cabin she rememb oven then and she wonder how foolish she was to think of it at that time that she wish she had put on anoth dress and the babi best cloth and she kept pray that the hous would be spare so that he when he return would have someth to come to and it wouldnt be quit so desol andhow could he ever know what had becom of her and babi and at the thought she grew sick and faint but she had someth els to do besid worri for whenev the long root of her ark struck an obstacl the whole trunk made half a revolut and twice dip her in the black water the hound who kept distract her by run up and down the tree and howl at last fell off at one of these collis he swam for some time besid her and she tri to get the poor beast upon the tree but he act silli and wild and at last she lost sight of him forev then she and her babi were left alon the light which had burn for a few minut in the desert cabin was quench sudden she could not then tell whither she was drift the outlin of the white dune on the peninsula show dim ahead and she judg the tree was move in a line with the river it must be about slack water and she had probabl reach the eddi form by the confluenc of the tide and the overflow water of the river unless the tide fell soon there was present danger of her drift to it channel and be carri out to sea or crush in the float drift that peril avert if she were carri out on the ebb toward the bay she might hope to strike one of the wood promontori of the peninsula and rest till daylight sometim she thought she heard voic and shout from the river and the bellow of cattl and bleat of sheep then again it was onli the ring in her ear and throb of her heart she found at about this time that she was so chill and stiffen in her cramp posit that she could scarc move and the babi cri so when she put it to her breast that she notic the milk refus to flow and she was so frighten at that that she put her head under her shawl and for the first time cri bitter when she rais her head again the boom of the surf was behind her and she knew that her ark had again swung round she dip up the water to cool her parch throat and found that it was salt as her tear there was a relief though for by this sign she knew that she was drift with the tide it was then the wind went down and the great and aw silenc oppress her there was scarc a rippl against the furrow side of the great trunk on which she rest and around her all was black gloom and quiet she spoke to the babi just to hear herself speak and to know that she had not lost her voic she thought thenit was queer but she could not help think ithow aw must have been the night when the great ship swung over the asiat peak and the sound of creation were blot out from the world she thought too of marin cling to spar and of poor women who were lash to raft and beaten to death by the cruel sea she tri to thank god that she was thus spare and lift her eye from the babi who had fallen into a fret sleep sudden away to the southward a great light lift itself out of the gloom and flash and flicker and flicker and flash again her heart flutter quick against the babi cold cheek it was the lighthous at the entranc of the bay as she was yet wonder the tree sudden roll a littl drag a littl and then seem to lie quiet and still she put out her hand and the current gurgl against it the tree was aground and by the posit of the light and the nois of the surf aground upon the dedlow marsh had it not been for her babi who was ail and croupi had it not been for the sudden dri up of that sensit fountain she would have felt safe and reliev perhap it was this which tend to make all her impress mourn and gloomi as the tide rapid fell a great flock of black brant flutter by her scream and cri then the plover flew up and pipe mourn as they wheel around the trunk and at

a nice quiet snooz empti stage sir the man of no account his name was faggdavid fagg he came to california in 52 with us in the skyscrap i dont think he did it in an adventur way he probabl had no other place to go to when a knot of us young fellow would recit what splendid opportun we resign to go and how sorri our friend were to have us leav and show daguerreotyp and lock of hair and talk of mari and susan the man of no account use to sit by and listen with a pain mortifi express on his plain face and say noth i think he had noth to say he had no associ except when we patron him and in point of fact he was a good deal of sport to us he was alway seasick whenev we had a cap of wind he never got his sea leg on either and i never shall forget how we all laugh when eattler took him the piec of pork on a string andbut you know that time honor joke and then we had such a splendid lark with him miss fanni twinkler couldnt bear the sight of him and we use to make fagg think that she had taken a fanci to him and sent him littl delicaci and book from the cabin you ought to have wit the rich scene that took place when he came up stammer and veri sick to thank her didnt she flash up grand and beauti and scorn so like medora rattler saidrattl knew byron by heartand wasnt old fagg aw cut up but he got over it and when rattler fell sick at valparaiso old fagg use to nurs him you see he was a good sort of fellow but he lack manli and spirit he had absolut no idea of poetri ive seen him sit stolid by mend his old cloth when rattler deliv that stir apostroph of byron to the ocean he ask rattler onc quit serious if he thought byron was ever seasick i dont rememb rattler repli but i know we all laugh veri much and i have no doubt it was someth good for rattler was smart when the skyscrap arriv at san francisco we had a grand feed we agre to meet everi year and perpetu the occas of cours we didnt invit fagg fagg was a steerag passeng and it was necessari you see now we were ashor to exercis a littl discret but old fagg as we call himh was onli about twenti five year old by the waywa the sourc of immens amus to us that day it appear that he had conceiv the idea that he could walk to sacramento and actual start off afoot we had a good time and shook hand with one anoth all around and so part ah me onli eight year ago and yet some of those hand then clasp in amiti have been clench at each other or have dip furtiv in one anoth pocket i know that we didnt dine togeth the next year becaus young barker swore he wouldnt put his feet under the same mahogani with such a veri contempt scoundrel as that mixer and nibbl who borrow money at valparaiso of young stubb who was then a waiter in a restaur didnt like to meet such peopl when i bought a number of share in the coyot tunnel at mugginsvill in 54 i thought id take a run up there and see it i stop at the empir hotel and after dinner i got a hors and rode round the town and out to the claim one of those individu whom newspap correspond call our intellig inform and to whom in all small communiti the right of answer question is tacit yield was quiet point out to me habit had enabl him to work and talk at the same time and he never pretermit either he gave me a histori of the claim and ad you see stranger he address the bank befor him gold is sure to come outer that theer claim he put in a comma with his pick but the old pro pri e tor he wriggl out the word and the point of his pick warnt of much account a long stroke of the pick for a period he was green and let the boy about here jump himand the rest of his sentenc was confid to his hat which he had remov to wipe his man brow with his red bandana i ask him who was the origin proprietor his name war fagg i went to see him he look a littl older and plainer he had work hard he said and was get on so so i took quit a like to him and patron him to some extent whether i did so becaus i was begin to have a distrust for such fellow as rattler and mixer is not necessari for me to state you rememb how the coyot tunnel went in and how aw we sharehold were done well the next thing i heard was that rattler who was one of the heaviest sharehold was up at mugginsvill keep bar for the proprietor of the mugginsvill hotel and that old fagg had struck it rich and didnt know what to do with his money all this was told me by mixer who had been there settl up matter and likewis that eagg was sweet upon the daughter of the proprietor of the aforesaid hotel and so by hearsay and letter i eventu gather that old robin the hotel man was tri to get up a match between nelli robin and fagg nelli was a pretti plump and foolish littl thing and would do just as her father wish i thought it would be a good thing forfagg if he should marri and settl down that as a marri man he might be of some account so i ran up to mugginsvill one day to look after thing it did me an immens deal of good to make rattler mix my drink for merattl the gay brilliant and unconquer rattler who had tri to snub me two year ago i talk to him about old fagg and nelli particular as i thought the subject was distast he never like fagg and he was sure he said that nelli did nt did nelli like anybodi els he turn round to the mirror behind the bar and brush up his hair i understood the conceit wretch i thought ld put fagg on his guard and get him to hurri up matter i had a long talk with him you could see by the way the poor fellow act that he was bad stuck he sigh and promis to pluck up courag to hurri matter to a crisi nelli was a good girl and i think had a sort of quiet respect for old fagg unobtrus but her fanci was alreadi taken captiv by rattler superfici qualiti which were obvious and pleas i dont think nelli was ani wors than you or i we are more apt to take acquaint at their appar valu than their intrins worth it less troubl and except when we want to trust them quit as conveni the difficulti with women is that their feel are apt to get interest sooner than our and then you know reason is out of the question this is what old fagg would have known had he been of ani account but he was nt so much the wors for him it was a few month afterward and i was sit in my offic when in walk old fagg i was surpris to see him down but we talk over the current topic in that mechan manner of peopl who know that they have someth els to say but are oblig to get at it in that formal way after an interv fagg in his natur manner said im go home go home yesthat is i think ill take a trip to the atlant state i came to see you as you know i have some littl properti and i have execut a power of attorney for you to manag my affair i have some paper id like to leav with you will you take charg of them yes i said but what of nelli his face fell he tri to smile and the combin result in one of the most startl and grotesqu effect i ever beheld at length he said i shall not marri nelliethat ish seem to apolog intern for the posit form of expressioni think that i had better not david fagg i said with sudden sever your of no account to my astonish his face brighten yes said he that itim of no account but i alway knew it you see i thought rattler love that girl as well as i did and i knew she like him better than she did me and would be happier i dare say with him but then i knew that old robin would have prefer me to him as i was better offand the girl would do as he saidand you see i thought i was kinder in the wayand so i left but he continu as i was about to interrupt him for fear the old man might object to rattler ive lent him enough to set him up in busi for himself in dogtown a push activ brilliant fellow you know like rattler can get along and will soon be in his old posit againand you neednt be hard on him you know if he doesnt good by i was too much disgust with his treatment of that rattler to be at all amiabl but as his busi was profit i promis to attend to it and he left a few week pass the return steamer arriv and a terribl incid occupi the paper for day afterward peopl in all part of the state con eager the detail of an aw shipwreck and those who had friend aboard went away by themselv and read the long list of the lost under their breath i read of the gift the gallant the nobl and love one who had perish and among them i think i was the first to read the name of david fagg for the man of no account had gone
