scene  the mississippi valley time  forti to fifti year ago chapter i you dont know about me without you have read a book by the name of the adventur of tom sawyer but that aint no matter  that book was made by mr mark twain and he told the truth main  there was thing which he stretch but main he told the truth  that is noth  i never seen anybodi but lie one time or anoth without it was aunt polli or the widow or mayb mari  aunt pollytom aunt polli she isand mari and the widow dougla is all told about in that book which is most a true book with some stretcher as i said befor now the way that the book wind up is this  tom and me found the money that the robber hid in the cave and it made us rich  we got six thousand dollar apieceal gold  it was an aw sight of money when it was pile up  well judg thatcher he took it and put it out at interest and it fetch us a dollar a day apiec all the year roundmor than a bodi could tell what to do with  the widow dougla she took me for her son and allow she would sivil me but it was rough live in the hous all the time consid how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her way and so when i couldnt stand it no longer i lit out  i got into my old rag and my sugar hogshead again and was free and satisfi  but tom sawyer he hunt me up and said he was go to start a band of robber and i might join if i would go back to the widow and be respect  so i went back the widow she cri over me and call me a poor lost lamb and she call me a lot of other name too but she never meant no harm by it she put me in them new cloth again and i couldnt do noth but sweat and sweat and feel all cramp up  well then the old thing commenc again  the widow rung a bell for supper and you had to come to time when you got to the tabl you couldnt go right to eat but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumbl a littl over the victual though there warnt realli anyth the matter with themthat is noth onli everyth was cook by itself  in a barrel of odd and end it is differ thing get mix up and the juic kind of swap around and the thing go better after supper she got out her book and learn me about mose and the bulrush and i was in a sweat to find out all about him but by and by she let it out that mose had been dead a consider long time so then i didnt care no more about him becaus i dont take no stock in dead peopl pretti soon i want to smoke and ask the widow to let me  but she wouldnt  she said it was a mean practic and wasnt clean and i must tri to not do it ani more  that is just the way with some peopl  they get down on a thing when they dont know noth about it  here she was a bother about mose which was no kin to her and no use to anybodi be gone you see yet find a power of fault with me for do a thing that had some good in it  and she took snuff too of cours that was all right becaus she done it herself her sister miss watson a toler slim old maid with goggl on had just come to live with her and took a set at me now with a spell book she work me middl hard for about an hour and then the widow made her eas up  i couldnt stood it much longer  then for an hour it was dead dull and i was fidgeti  miss watson would say dont put your feet up there huckleberri and dont scrunch up like that huckleberryset up straight and pretti soon she would say dont gap and stretch like that huckleberrywhi dont you tri to behav  then she told me all about the bad place and i said i wish i was there she got mad then but i didnt mean no harm  all i want was to go somewher all i want was a chang i warnt particular  she said it was wick to say what i said said she wouldnt say it for the whole world she was go to live so as to go to the good place  well i couldnt see no advantag in go where she was go so i made up my mind i wouldnt tri for it  but i never said so becaus it would onli make troubl and wouldnt do no good now she had got a start and she went on and told me all about the good place  she said all a bodi would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing forev and ever  so i didnt think much of it but i never said so  i ask her if she reckon tom sawyer would go there and she said not by a consider sight  i was glad about that becaus i want him and me to be togeth miss watson she kept peck at me and it got tiresom and lonesom  bi and by they fetch the nigger in and had prayer and then everybodi was off to bed  i went up to my room with a piec of candl and put it on the tabl  then i set down in a chair by the window and tri to think of someth cheer but it warnt no use  i felt so lonesom i most wish i was dead  the star were shine and the leav rustl in the wood ever so mourn and i heard an owl away off who whoo about somebodi that was dead and a whippowil and a dog cri about somebodi that was go to die and the wind was tri to whisper someth to me and i couldnt make out what it was and so it made the cold shiver run over me then away out in the wood i heard that kind of a sound that a ghost make when it want to tell about someth that on it mind and cant make itself understood and so cant rest easi in it grave and has to go about that way everi night griev  i got so down heart and scare i did wish i had some compani  pretti soon a spider went crawl up my shoulder and i flip it off and it lit in the candl and befor i could budg it was all shrivel up  i didnt need anybodi to tell me that that was an aw bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck so i was scare and most shook the cloth off of me i got up and turn around in my track three time and cross my breast everi time and then i tie up a littl lock of my hair with a thread to keep witch away  but i hadnt no confid  you do that when youv lost a horsesho that youv found instead of nail it up over the door but i hadnt ever heard anybodi say it was ani way to keep off bad luck when youd kill a spider i set down again a shake all over and got out my pipe for a smoke for the hous was all as still as death now and so the widow wouldnt know well after a long time i heard the clock away off in the town go boomboomboomtwelv lick and all still againstil than ever pretti soon i heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the treessometh was a stir  i set still and listen  direct i could just bare hear a me yow me yow down there  that was good  say i me yow me yow as soft as i could and then i put out the light and scrambl out of the window on to the shed  then i slip down to the ground and crawl in among the tree and sure enough there was tom sawyer wait for me chapter ii we went tipto along a path amongst the tree back toward the end of the widow garden stoop down so as the branch wouldnt scrape our head when we was pass by the kitchen i fell over a root and made a nois  we scrouch down and laid still  miss watson big nigger name jim was set in the kitchen door we could see him pretti clear becaus there was a light behind him  he got up and stretch his neck out about a minut listen  then he say who dah he listen some more then he come tipto down and stood right between us we could a touch him near  well like it was minut and minut that there warnt a sound and we all there so close togeth  there was a place on my ankl that got to itch but i dasnt scratch it and then my ear begun to itch and next my back right between my shoulder  seem like id die if i couldnt scratch  well ive notic that thing plenti time sinc  if you are with the qualiti or at a funer or tri to go to sleep when you aint sleepyif you are anywher where it wont do for you to scratch whi you will itch all over in upward of a thousand place pretti soon jim say say who is you  whar is you  dog my cat ef i didn hear sumfn well i know what is gwyne to do  is gwyne to set down here and listen tell i hear it agin so he set down on the ground betwixt me and tom  he lean his back up against a tree and stretch his leg out till one of them most touch one of mine  mi nose begun to itch  it itch till the tear come into my eye  but i dasnt scratch  then it begun to itch on the insid next i got to itch underneath  i didnt know how i was go to set still this miser went on as much as six or seven minut but it seem a sight longer than that  i was itch in eleven differ place now  i reckon i couldnt stand it moren a minut longer but i set my teeth hard and got readi to tri  just then jim begun to breath heavi next he begun to snoreand then i was pretti soon comfort again tom he made a sign to mekind of a littl nois with his mouthand we went creep away on our hand and knee  when we was ten foot off tom whisper to me and want to tie jim to the tree for fun  but i said no he might wake and make a disturb and then theyd find out i warnt in then tom said he hadnt got candl enough and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more  i didnt want him to tri  i said jim might wake up and come  but tom want to resk it so we slid in there and got three candl and tom laid five cent on the tabl for pay then we got out and i was in a sweat to get away but noth would do tom but he must crawl to where jim was on his hand and knee and play someth on him  i wait and it seem a good while everyth was so still and lonesom as soon as tom was back we cut along the path around the garden fenc and by and by fetch up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the hous  tom said he slip jim hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him and jim stir a littl but he didnt wake afterward jim said the witch be witch him and put him in a tranc and rode him all over the state and then set him under the tree again and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it  and next time jim told it he said they rode him down to new orlean and after that everi time he told it he spread it more and more till by and by he said they rode him all over the world and tire him most to death and his back was all over saddl boil  jim was monstrous proud about it and he got so he wouldnt hard notic the other nigger  nigger would come mile to hear jim tell about it and he was more look up to than ani nigger in that countri  strang nigger would stand with their mouth open and look him all over same as if he was a wonder  nigger is alway talk about witch in the dark by the kitchen fire but whenev one was talk and let on to know all about such thing jim would happen in and say hm  what you know bout witch and that nigger was cork up and had to take a back seat  jim alway kept that five center piec round his neck with a string and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hand and told him he could cure anybodi with it and fetch witch whenev he want to just by say someth to it but he never told what it was he said to it  nigger would come from all around there and give jim anyth they had just for a sight of that five center piec but they wouldnt touch it becaus the devil had had his hand on it  jim was most ruin for a servant becaus he got stuck up on account of have seen the devil and been rode by witch well when tom and me got to the edg of the hilltop we look away down into the villag and could see three or four light twinkl where there was sick folk mayb and the star over us was sparkl ever so fine and down by the villag was the river a whole mile broad and aw still and grand  we went down the hill and found jo harper and ben roger and two or three more of the boy hid in the old tanyard  so we unhitch a skiff and pull down the river two mile and a half to the big scar on the hillsid and went ashor we went to a clump of bush and tom made everybodi swear to keep the secret and then show them a hole in the hill right in the thickest part of the bush  then we lit the candl and crawl in on our hand and knee  we went about two hundr yard and then the cave open up tom poke about amongst the passag and pretti soon duck under a wall where you wouldnt a notic that there was a hole  we went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room all damp and sweati and cold and there we stop  tom say now well start this band of robber and call it tom sawyer gang everybodi that want to join has got to take an oath and write his name in blood everybodi was will  so tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on and read it  it swore everi boy to stick to the band and never tell ani of the secret and if anybodi done anyth to ani boy in the band whichev boy was order to kill that person and his famili must do it and he mustnt eat and he mustnt sleep till he had kill them and hack a cross in their breast which was the sign of the band and nobodi that didnt belong to the band could use that mark and if he did he must be su and if he done it again he must be kill  and if anybodi that belong to the band told the secret he must have his throat cut and then have his carcass burnt up and the ash scatter all around and his name blot off of the list with blood and never mention again by the gang but have a curs put on it and be forgot forev everybodi said it was a real beauti oath and ask tom if he got it out of his own head  he said some of it but the rest was out of pirat book and robber book and everi gang that was high tone had it some thought it would be good to kill the famili of boy that told the secret  tom said it was a good idea so he took a pencil and wrote it in then ben roger say here huck finn he haint got no famili what you go to do bout him well haint he got a father say tom sawyer yes hes got a father but you cant never find him these day  he use to lay drunk with the hog in the tanyard but he haint been seen in these part for a year or more they talk it over and they was go to rule me out becaus they said everi boy must have a famili or somebodi to kill or els it wouldnt be fair and squar for the other  well nobodi could think of anyth to doeverybodi was stump and set still  i was most readi to cri but all at onc i thought of a way and so i offer them miss watsonthey could kill her  everybodi said oh shell do  that all right  huck can come in then they all stuck a pin in their finger to get blood to sign with and i made my mark on the paper now say ben roger what the line of busi of this gang noth onli robberi and murder tom said but who are we go to robhous or cattl or stuff steal cattl and such thing aint robberi it burglari say tom sawyer  we aint burglar  that aint no sort of style  we are highwaymen  we stop stage and carriag on the road with mask on and kill the peopl and take their watch and money must we alway kill the peopl oh certain  it best  some author think differ but most it consid best to kill themexcept some that you bring to the cave here and keep them till theyr ransom ransom  what that i dont know  but that what they do  ive seen it in book and so of cours that what weve got to do but how can we do it if we dont know what it is whi blame it all weve got to do it  dont i tell you it in the book  do you want to go to do differ from what in the book and get thing all muddl up oh that all veri fine to say tom sawyer but how in the nation are these fellow go to be ransom if we dont know how to do it to themthat the thing i want to get at  now what do you reckon it is well i dont know  but perap if we keep them till theyr ransom it mean that we keep them till theyr dead now that someth like  thatll answer  whi couldnt you said that befor  well keep them till theyr ransom to death and a bothersom lot theyll be tooeat up everyth and alway tri to get loos how you talk ben roger  how can they get loos when there a guard over them readi to shoot them down if they move a peg a guard  well that is good  so somebodi got to set up all night and never get ani sleep just so as to watch them  i think that foolish whi cant a bodi take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here becaus it aint in the book sothat whi  now ben roger do you want to do thing regular or dont youthat the idea  dont you reckon that the peopl that made the book know what the correct thing to do  do you reckon you can learn em anyth  not by a good deal no sir well just go on and ransom them in the regular way all right  i dont mind but i say it a fool way anyhow  say do we kill the women too well ben roger if i was as ignor as you i wouldnt let on  kill the women  no nobodi ever saw anyth in the book like that  you fetch them to the cave and your alway as polit as pie to them and by and by they fall in love with you and never want to go home ani more well if that the way im agre but i dont take no stock in it mighti soon well have the cave so clutter up with women and fellow wait to be ransom that there wont be no place for the robber but go ahead i aint got noth to say littl tommi barn was asleep now and when they wake him up he was scare and cri and said he want to go home to his ma and didnt want to be a robber ani more so they all made fun of him and call him cri babi and that made him mad and he said he would go straight and tell all the secret  but tom give him five cent to keep quiet and said we would all go home and meet next week and rob somebodi and kill some peopl ben roger said he couldnt get out much onli sunday and so he want to begin next sunday but all the boy said it would be wick to do it on sunday and that settl the thing  they agre to get togeth and fix a day as soon as they could and then we elect tom sawyer first captain and jo harper second captain of the gang and so start home i clumb up the shed and crept into my window just befor day was break my new cloth was all greas up and clayey and i was dog tire chapter iii well i got a good go over in the morn from old miss watson on account of my cloth but the widow she didnt scold but onli clean off the greas and clay and look so sorri that i thought i would behav awhil if i could  then miss watson she took me in the closet and pray but noth come of it  she told me to pray everi day and whatev i ask for i would get it  but it warnt so  i tri it onc i got a fish line but no hook  it warnt ani good to me without hook  i tri for the hook three or four time but somehow i couldnt make it work  bi and by one day i ask miss watson to tri for me but she said i was a fool  she never told me whi and i couldnt make it out no way i set down one time back in the wood and had a long think about it  i say to myself if a bodi can get anyth they pray for whi dont deacon winn get back the money he lost on pork  whi cant the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole  whi cant miss watson fat up no say i to my self there aint noth in it  i went and told the widow about it and she said the thing a bodi could get by pray for it was spiritu gift  this was too mani for me but she told me what she meanti must help other peopl and do everyth i could for other peopl and look out for them all the time and never think about myself this was includ miss watson as i took it  i went out in the wood and turn it over in my mind a long time but i couldnt see no advantag about itexcept for the other peopl so at last i reckon i wouldnt worri about it ani more but just let it go  sometim the widow would take me one side and talk about provid in a way to make a bodi mouth water but mayb next day miss watson would take hold and knock it all down again  i judg i could see that there was two provid and a poor chap would stand consider show with the widow provid but if miss watson got him there warnt no help for him ani more  i thought it all out and reckon i would belong to the widow if he want me though i couldnt make out how he was a go to be ani better off then than what he was befor see i was so ignor and so kind of low down and orneri pap he hadnt been seen for more than a year and that was comfort for me i didnt want to see him no more  he use to alway whale me when he was sober and could get his hand on me though i use to take to the wood most of the time when he was around  well about this time he was found in the river drownd about twelv mile abov town so peopl said  they judg it was him anyway said this drownd man was just his size and was rag and had uncommon long hair which was all like pap but they couldnt make noth out of the face becaus it had been in the water so long it warnt much like a face at all  they said he was float on his back in the water  they took him and buri him on the bank  but i warnt comfort long becaus i happen to think of someth  i know mighti well that a drownd man dont float on his back but on his face  so i know then that this warnt pap but a woman dress up in a man cloth  so i was uncomfort again  i judg the old man would turn up again by and by though i wish he wouldnt we play robber now and then about a month and then i resign  all the boy did  we hadnt rob nobodi hadnt kill ani peopl but onli just pretend  we use to hop out of the wood and go charg down on hog driver and women in cart take garden stuff to market but we never hive ani of them  tom sawyer call the hog ingot and he call the turnip and stuff juleri and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done and how mani peopl we had kill and mark  but i couldnt see no profit in it  one time tom sent a boy to run about town with a blaze stick which he call a slogan which was the sign for the gang to get togeth and then he said he had got secret news by his spi that next day a whole parcel of spanish merchant and rich a rab was go to camp in cave hollow with two hundr eleph and six hundr camel and over a thousand sumter mule all load down with dimond and they didnt have onli a guard of four hundr soldier and so we would lay in ambuscad as he call it and kill the lot and scoop the thing  he said we must slick up our sword and gun and get readi  he never could go after even a turnip cart but he must have the sword and gun all scour up for it though they was onli lath and broomstick and you might scour at them till you rot and then they warnt worth a mouth of ash more than what they was befor  i didnt believ we could lick such a crowd of spaniard and a rab but i want to see the camel and eleph so i was on hand next day saturday in the ambuscad and when we got the word we rush out of the wood and down the hill  but there warnt no spaniard and a rab and there warnt no camel nor no eleph  it warnt anyth but a sunday school picnic and onli a primer class at that  we bust it up and chase the children up the hollow but we never got anyth but some doughnut and jam though ben roger got a rag doll and jo harper got a hymn book and a tract and then the teacher charg in and made us drop everyth and cut  i didnt see no dimond and i told tom sawyer so  he said there was load of them there anyway and he said there was a rab there too and eleph and thing  i said whi couldnt we see them then  he said if i warnt so ignor but had read a book call don quixot i would know without ask  he said it was all done by enchant  he said there was hundr of soldier there and eleph and treasur and so on but we had enemi which he call magician and they had turn the whole thing into an infant sunday school just out of spite  i said all right then the thing for us to do was to go for the magician  tom sawyer said i was a numskul whi said he a magician could call up a lot of geni and they would hash you up like noth befor you could say jack robinson  they are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church well i say spose we got some geni to help us cant we lick the other crowd then how you go to get them i dont know  how do they get them whi they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring and then the geni come tear in with the thunder and lightn a rip around and the smoke a roll and everyth theyr told to do they up and do it  they dont think noth of pull a shot tower up by the root and belt a sunday school superintend over the head with itor ani other man who make them tear around so whi whoever rub the lamp or the ring  they belong to whoever rub the lamp or the ring and theyv got to do whatev he say  if he tell them to build a palac forti mile long out of dimond and fill it full of chew gum or whatev you want and fetch an emperor daughter from china for you to marri theyv got to do itand theyv got to do it befor sun up next morn too  and more  theyv got to waltz that palac around over the countri wherev you want it you understand well say i i think they are a pack of flat head for not keep the palac themselv stead of fool them away like that  and what moreif i was one of them i would see a man in jericho befor i would drop my busi and come to him for the rub of an old tin lamp how you talk huck finn  whi youd have to come when he rub it whether you want to or not what and i as high as a tree and as big as a church  all right then i would come but i lay id make that man climb the highest tree there was in the countri shuck it aint no use to talk to you huck finn  you dont seem to know anyth somehowperfect saphead i thought all this over for two or three day and then i reckon i would see if there was anyth in it  i got an old tin lamp and an iron ring and went out in the wood and rub and rub till i sweat like an injun calcul to build a palac and sell it but it warnt no use none of the geni come  so then i judg that all that stuff was onli just one of tom sawyer lie  i reckon he believ in the a rab and the eleph but as for me i think differ  it had all the mark of a sunday school chapter iv well three or four month run along and it was well into the winter now i had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a littl and could say the multipl tabl up to six time seven is thirti five and i dont reckon i could ever get ani further than that if i was to live forev  i dont take no stock in mathemat anyway at first i hate the school but by and by i got so i could stand it whenev i got uncommon tire i play hookey and the hide i got next day done me good and cheer me up  so the longer i went to school the easier it got to be  i was get sort of use to the widow way too and they warnt so raspi on me  live in a hous and sleep in a bed pull on me pretti tight most but befor the cold weather i use to slide out and sleep in the wood sometim and so that was a rest to me  i like the old way best but i was get so i like the new one too a littl bit the widow said i was come along slow but sure and do veri satisfactori  she said she warnt asham of me one morn i happen to turn over the salt cellar at breakfast  i reach for some of it as quick as i could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck but miss watson was in ahead of me and cross me off she say take your hand away huckleberri what a mess you are alway make  the widow put in a good word for me but that warnt go to keep off the bad luck i know that well enough  i start out after breakfast feel worri and shaki and wonder where it was go to fall on me and what it was go to be  there is way to keep off some kind of bad luck but this wasnt one of them kind so i never tri to do anyth but just poke along low spirit and on the watch out i went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fenc  there was an inch of new snow on the ground and i seen somebodi track  they had come up from the quarri and stood around the stile a while and then went on around the garden fenc  it was funni they hadnt come in after stand around so  i couldnt make it out  it was veri curious somehow  i was go to follow around but i stoop down to look at the track first  i didnt notic anyth at first but next i did  there was a cross in the left boot heel made with big nail to keep off the devil i was up in a second and shin down the hill  i look over my shoulder everi now and then but i didnt see nobodi  i was at judg thatcher as quick as i could get there  he said whi my boy you are all out of breath  did you come for your interest no sir i say

i was black and blue if i didnt rais some money for him  i borrow three dollar from judg thatcher and pap took it and got drunk and went a blow around and cuss and whoop and carri on and he kept it up all over town with a tin pan till most midnight then they jail him and next day they had him befor court and jail him again for a week  but he said he was satisfi said he was boss of his son and hed make it warm for him when he got out the new judg said he was a go to make a man of him so he took him to his own hous and dress him up clean and nice and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the famili and was just old pie to him so to speak  and after supper he talk to him about temper and such thing till the old man cri and said hed been a fool and fool away his life but now he was a go to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobodi wouldnt be asham of and he hope the judg would help him and not look down on him  the judg said he could hug him for them word so he cri and his wife she cri again pap said hed been a man that had alway been misunderstood befor and the judg said he believ it  the old man said that what a man want that was down was sympathi and the judg said it was so so they cri again  and when it was bedtim the old man rose up and held out his hand and say look at it gentlemen and ladi all take a hold of it shake it there a hand that was the hand of a hog but it aint so no more it the hand of a man that start in on a new life andll die befor hell go back  you mark them wordsdont forget i said them  it a clean hand now shake itdont be afeard so they shook it one after the other all around and cri  the judg wife she kiss it  then the old man he sign a pledgemad his mark the judg said it was the holiest time on record or someth like that then they tuck the old man into a beauti room which was the spare room and in the night some time he got power thirsti and clumb out on to the porch roof and slid down a stanchion and trade his new coat for a jug of forti rod and clumb back again and had a good old time and toward daylight he crawl out again drunk as a fiddler and roll off the porch and broke his left arm in two place and was most froze to death when somebodi found him after sun up  and when they come to look at that spare room they had to take sound befor they could navig it the judg he felt kind of sore  he said he reckon a bodi could reform the old man with a shotgun mayb but he didnt know no other way chapter vi well pretti soon the old man was up and around again and then he went for judg thatcher in the court to make him give up that money and he went for me too for not stop school  he catch me a coupl of time and thrash me but i went to school just the same and dodg him or outrun him most of the time  i didnt want to go to school much befor but i reckon id go now to spite pap  that law trial was a slow businessappear like they warnt ever go to get start on it so everi now and then id borrow two or three dollar off of the judg for him to keep from get a cowhid  everi time he got money he got drunk and everi time he got drunk he rais cain around town and everi time he rais cain he got jail  he was just suitedthi kind of thing was right in his line he got to hang around the widow too much and so she told him at last that if he didnt quit use around there she would make troubl for him well wasnt he mad  he said he would show who was huck finn boss  so he watch out for me one day in the spring and catch me and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff and cross over to the illinoi shore where it was woodi and there warnt no hous but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldnt find it if you didnt know where it was he kept me with him all the time and i never got a chanc to run off we live in that old cabin and he alway lock the door and put the key under his head night  he had a gun which he had stole i reckon and we fish and hunt and that was what we live on  everi littl while he lock me in and went down to the store three mile to the ferri and trade fish and game for whiski and fetch it home and got drunk and had a good time and lick me  the widow she found out where i was by and by and she sent a man over to tri to get hold of me but pap drove him off with the gun and it warnt long after that till i was use to be where i was and like ital but the cowhid part it was kind of lazi and jolli lay off comfort all day smoke and fish and no book nor studi  two month or more run along and my cloth got to be all rag and dirt and i didnt see how id ever got to like it so well at the widow where you had to wash and eat on a plate and comb up and go to bed and get up regular and be forev bother over a book and have old miss watson peck at you all the time  i didnt want to go back no more  i had stop cuss becaus the widow didnt like it but now i took to it again becaus pap hadnt no object  it was pretti good time up in the wood there take it all around but by and by pap got too handi with his hickri and i couldnt stand it i was all over welt  he got to go away so much too and lock me in  onc he lock me in and was gone three day  it was dread lonesom  i judg he had got drownd and i wasnt ever go to get out ani more  i was scare  i made up my mind i would fix up some way to leav there  i had tri to get out of that cabin mani a time but i couldnt find no way  there warnt a window to it big enough for a dog to get through  i couldnt get up the chimbl it was too narrow  the door was thick solid oak slab  pap was pretti care not to leav a knife or anyth in the cabin when he was away i reckon i had hunt the place over as much as a hundr time well i was most all the time at it becaus it was about the onli way to put in the time  but this time i found someth at last i found an old rusti wood saw without ani handl it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboard of the roof i greas it up and went to work  there was an old hors blanket nail against the log at the far end of the cabin behind the tabl to keep the wind from blow through the chink and put the candl out  i got under the tabl and rais the blanket and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log outbig enough to let me through  well it was a good long job but i was get toward the end of it when i heard pap gun in the wood  i got rid of the sign of my work and drop the blanket and hid my saw and pretti soon pap come in pap warnt in a good humorso he was his natur self  he said he was down town and everyth was go wrong  his lawyer said he reckon he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got start on the trial but then there was way to put it off a long time and judg thatcher know how to do it and he said peopl allow there be anoth trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian and they guess it would win this time  this shook me up consider becaus i didnt want to go back to the widow ani more and be so cramp up and sivil as they call it  then the old man got to cuss and cuss everyth and everybodi he could think of and then cuss them all over again to make sure he hadnt skip ani and after that he polish off with a kind of a general cuss all round includ a consider parcel of peopl which he didnt know the name of and so call them what his name when he got to them and went right along with his cuss he said he would like to see the widow get me  he said he would watch out and if they tri to come ani such game on him he know of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in where they might hunt till they drop and they couldnt find me  that made me pretti uneasi again but onli for a minut i reckon i wouldnt stay on hand till he got that chanc the old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the thing he had got there was a fifti pound sack of corn meal and a side of bacon ammunit and a four gallon jug of whiski and an old book and two newspap for wad besid some tow  i tote up a load and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest  i thought it all over and i reckon i would walk off with the gun and some line and take to the wood when i run away  i guess i wouldnt stay in one place but just tramp right across the countri most night time and hunt and fish to keep aliv and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldnt ever find me ani more  i judg i would saw out and leav that night if pap got drunk enough and i reckon he would  i got so full of it i didnt notic how long i was stay till the old man holler and ask me whether i was asleep or drownd i got the thing all up to the cabin and then it was about dark  while i was cook supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warm up and went to rip again  he had been drunk over in town and laid in the gutter all night and he was a sight to look at  a bodi would a thought he was adamh was just all mud  whenev his liquor begun to work he most alway went for the govment this time he say call this a govment whi just look at it and see what it like here the law a stand readi to take a man son away from hima man own son which he has had all the troubl and all the anxieti and all the expens of rais  ye just as that man has got that son rais at last and readi to go to work and begin to do suthin for him and give him a rest the law up and goe for him  and they call that govment  that aint all nuther  the law back that old judg thatcher up and help him to keep me out o my properti  here what the law doe  the law take a man worth six thousand dollar and upard and jam him into an old trap of a cabin like this and let him go round in cloth that aint fitten for a hog they call that govment  a man cant get his right in a govment like this sometim ive a mighti notion to just leav the countri for good and all yes and i told em so i told old thatcher so to his face  lot of em heard me and can tell what i said  say i for two cent id leav the blame countri and never come a near it agin  them the veri word  i say look at my hatif you call it a hatbut the lid rais up and the rest of it goe down till it below my chin and then it aint right a hat at all but more like my head was shove up through a jint o stove pipe  look at it say isuch a hat for me to wearon of the wealthiest men in this town if i could git my right oh yes this is a wonder govment wonder  whi looki here there was a free nigger there from ohioa mulatt most as white as a white man  he had the whitest shirt on you ever see too and the shiniest hat and there aint a man in that town that got as fine cloth as what he had and he had a gold watch and chain and a silver head caneth awfulest old gray head nabob in the state  and what do you think  they said he was a pfessor in a colleg and could talk all kind of languag and know everyth  and that aint the wust they said he could vote when he was at home  well that let me out think i what is the countri a come to  it was lection day and i was just about to go and vote myself if i warnt too drunk to get there but when they told me there was a state in this countri where theyd let that nigger vote i draw out  i say ill never vote agin  them the veri word i said they all heard me and the countri may rot for all meill never vote agin as long as i live  and to see the cool way of that niggerwhi he wouldnt a give me the road if i hadnt shove him out o the way  i say to the peopl whi aint this nigger put up at auction and soldthat what i want to know  and what do you reckon they said whi they said he couldnt be sold till hed been in the state six month and he hadnt been there that long yet  there nowthat a specimen  they call that a govment that cant sell a free nigger till hes been in the state six month  here a govment that call itself a govment and let on to be a govment and think it is a govment and yet got to set stock still for six whole month befor it can take a hold of a prowl thiev infern white shirt free nigger and pap was ago on so he never notic where his old limber leg was take him to so he went head over heel over the tub of salt pork and bark both shin and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of languagemost hove at the nigger and the govment though he give the tub some too all along here and there  he hop around the cabin consider first on one leg and then on the other hold first one shin and then the other one and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetch the tub a rattl kick  but it warnt good judgment becaus that was the boot that had a coupl of his toe leak out of the front end of it so now he rais a howl that fair made a bodi hair rais and down he went in the dirt and roll there and held his toe and the cuss he done then laid over anyth he had ever done previous  he said so his own self afterward  he had heard old sowberri hagan in his best day and he said it laid over him too but i reckon that was sort of pile it on mayb after supper pap took the jug and said he had enough whiski there for two drunk and one delirium tremen  that was alway his word  i judg he would be blind drunk in about an hour and then i would steal the key or saw myself out one or tother  he drank and drank and tumbl down on his blanket by and by but luck didnt run my way  he didnt go sound asleep but was uneasi  he groan and moan and thrash around this way and that for a long time  at last i got so sleepi i couldnt keep my eye open all i could do and so befor i know what i was about i was sound asleep and the candl burn i dont know how long i was asleep but all of a sudden there was an aw scream and i was up  there was pap look wild and skip around everi which way and yell about snake  he said they was crawl up his leg and then he would give a jump and scream and say one had bit him on the cheekbut i couldnt see no snake  he start and run round and round the cabin holler take him off take him off hes bite me on the neck  i never see a man look so wild in the eye pretti soon he was all fag out and fell down pant then he roll over and over wonder fast kick thing everi which way and strike and grab at the air with his hand and scream and say there was devil a hold of him  he wore out by and by and laid still a while moan  then he laid stiller and didnt make a sound  i could hear the owl and the wolv away off in the wood and it seem terribl still  he was lay over by the corner by and by he rais up part way and listen with his head to one side  he say veri low tramptramptramp that the dead tramptramptramp theyr come after me but i wont go  oh theyr here dont touch medont hand offtheyr cold let go  oh let a poor devil alon then he went down on all four and crawl off beg them to let him alon and he roll himself up in his blanket and wallow in under the old pine tabl still a beg and then he went to cri  i could hear him through the blanket by and by he roll out and jump up on his feet look wild and he see me and went for me  he chase me round and round the place with a clasp knife call me the angel of death and say he would kill me and then i couldnt come for him no more  i beg and told him i was onli huck but he laugh such a screechi laugh and roar and cuss and kept on chase me up  onc when i turn short and dodg under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulder and i thought i was gone but i slid out of the jacket quick as lightn and save myself pretti soon he was all tire out and drop down with his back against the door and said he would rest a minut and then kill me he put his knife under him and said he would sleep and get strong and then he would see who was who so he doze off pretti soon  bi and by i got the old split bottom chair and clumb up as easi as i could not to make ani nois and got down the gun  i slip the ramrod down it to make sure it was load then i laid it across the turnip barrel point toward pap and set down behind it to wait for him to stir  and how slow and still the time did drag along chapter vii git up  what you bout i open my eye and look around tri to make out where i was  it was after sun up and i had been sound asleep  pap was stand over me look sour and sick too  he say what you doin with this gun i judg he didnt know noth about what he had been do so i say somebodi tri to get in so i was lay for him whi didnt you roust me out well i tri to but i couldnt i couldnt budg you well all right  dont stand there palav all day but out with you and see if there a fish on the line for breakfast  ill be along in a minut he unlock the door and i clear out up the river bank  i notic some piec of limb and such thing float down and a sprinkl of bark so i know the river had begun to rise  i reckon i would have great time now if i was over at the town  the june rise use to be alway luck for me becaus as soon as that rise begin here come cordwood float down and piec of log raftssometim a dozen log togeth so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood yard and the sawmil i went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and tother one out for what the rise might fetch along  well all at onc here come a cano just a beauti too about thirteen or fourteen foot long ride high like a duck  i shot head first off of the bank like a frog cloth and all on and struck out for the cano  i just expect there be somebodi lay down in it becaus peopl often done that to fool folk and when a chap had pull a skiff out most to it theyd rais up and laugh at him  but it warnt so this time  it was a drift cano sure enough and i clumb in and paddl her ashor  think i the old man will be glad when he see thissh worth ten dollar  but when i got to shore pap wasnt in sight yet and as i was run her into a littl creek like a gulli all hung over with vine and willow i struck anoth idea  i judg id hide her good and then stead of take to the wood when i run off id go down the river about fifti mile and camp in one place for good and not have such a rough time tramp on foot it was pretti close to the shanti and i thought i heard the old man come all the time but i got her hid and then i out and look around a bunch of willow and there was the old man down the path a piec just draw a bead on a bird with his gun  so he hadnt seen anyth when he got along i was hard at it take up a trot line  he abus me a littl for be so slow but i told him i fell in the river and that was what made me so long  i know he would see i was wet and then he would be ask question  we got five catfish off the line and went home while we laid off after breakfast to sleep up both of us be about wore out i got to think that if i could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from tri to follow me it would be a certain thing than trust to luck to get far enough off befor they miss me you see all kind of thing might happen  well i didnt see no way for a while but by and by pap rais up a minut to drink anoth barrel of water and he say anoth time a man come a prowl round here you roust me out you hear that man warnt here for no good  id a shot him  next time you roust me out you hear then he drop down and went to sleep again but what he had been say give me the veri idea i want  i say to myself i can fix it now so nobodi wont think of follow me about twelv oclock we turn out and went along up the bank  the river was come up pretti fast and lot of driftwood go by on the rise by and by along come part of a log raftnin log fast togeth  we went out with the skiff and tow it ashor  then we had dinner anybodi but pap would a wait and seen the day through so as to catch more stuff but that warnt pap style  nine log was enough for one time he must shove right over to town and sell  so he lock me in and took the skiff and start off tow the raft about half past three  i judg he wouldnt come back that night  i wait till i reckon he had got a good start then i out with my saw and went to work on that log again  befor he was tother side of the river i was out of the hole him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder i took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the cano was hid and shove the vine and branch apart and put it in then i done the same with the side of bacon then the whiski jug  i took all the coffe and sugar there was and all the ammunit i took the wad i took the bucket and gourd i took a dipper and a tin cup and my old saw and two blanket and the skillet and the coffe pot  i took fish line and match and other thingseveryth that was worth a cent  i clean out the place  i want an axe but there wasnt ani onli the one out at the woodpil and i know whi i was go to leav that  i fetch out the gun and now i was done i had wore the ground a good deal crawl out of the hole and drag out so mani thing  so i fix that as good as i could from the outsid by scatter dust on the place which cover up the smooth and the sawdust  then i fix the piec of log back into it place and put two rock under it and one against it to hold it there for it was bent up at that place and didnt quit touch ground  if you stood four or five foot away and didnt know it was saw you wouldnt never notic it and besid this was the back of the cabin and it warnt like anybodi would go fool around there it was all grass clear to the cano so i hadnt left a track  i follow around to see  i stood on the bank and look out over the river  all safe  so i took the gun and went up a piec into the wood and was hunt around for some bird when i see a wild pig hog soon went wild in them bottom after they had got away from the prairi farm i shot this fellow and took him into camp i took the axe and smash in the door  i beat it and hack it consider a do it  i fetch the pig in and took him back near to the tabl and hack into his throat with the axe and laid him down on the ground to bleed i say ground becaus it was groundhard pack and no board  well next i took an old sack and put a lot of big rock in ital i could dragand i start it from the pig and drag it to the door and through the wood down to the river and dump it in and down it sunk out of sight  you could easi see that someth had been drag over the ground  i did wish tom sawyer was there i know he would take an interest in this kind of busi and throw in the fanci touch  nobodi could spread himself like tom sawyer in such a thing as that well last i pull out some of my hair and blood the axe good and stuck it on the back side and slung the axe in the corner  then i took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket so he couldnt drip till i got a good piec below the hous and then dump him into the river  now i thought of someth els  so i went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the cano and fetch them to the hous  i took the bag to where it use to stand and rip a hole in the bottom of it with the saw for there warnt no knive and fork on the placepap done everyth with his clasp knife about the cook  then i carri the sack about a hundr yard across the grass and through the willow east of the hous to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushesand duck too you might say in the season  there was a slough or a creek lead out of it on the other side that went mile away i dont know where but it didnt go to the river  the meal sift out and made a littl track all the way to the lake  i drop pap whetston there too so as to look like it had been done by accid then i tie up the rip in the meal sack with a string so it wouldnt leak no more and took it and my saw to the cano again it was about dark now so i drop the cano down the river under some willow that hung over the bank and wait for the moon to rise  i made fast to a willow then i took a bite to eat and by and by laid down in the cano to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan  i say to myself theyll follow the track of that sack of rock to the shore and then drag the river for me  and theyll follow that meal track to the lake and go brows down the creek that lead out of it to find the robber that kill me and took the thing  they wont ever hunt the river for anyth but my dead carcass theyll soon get tire of that and wont bother no more about me  all right i can stop anywher i want to jackson island is good enough for me i know that island pretti well and nobodi ever come there  and then i can paddl over to town night and slink around and pick up thing i want jackson island the place i was pretti tire and the first thing i know i was asleep  when i woke up i didnt know where i was for a minut  i set up and look around a littl scare  then i rememb  the river look mile and mile across  the moon was so bright i could a count the drift log that went a slip along black and still hundr of yard out from shore everyth was dead quiet and it look late and smelt late you know what i meani dont know the word to put it in i took a good gap and a stretch and was just go to unhitch and start when i heard a sound away over the water  i listen  pretti soon i made it out  it was that dull kind of a regular sound that come from oar work in rowlock when it a still night  i peep out through the willow branch and there it wasa skiff away across the water  i couldnt tell how mani was in it  it kept a come and when it was abreast of me i see there warnt but one man in it  think i mayb it pap though i warnt expect him  he drop below me with the current and by and by he came a swing up shore in the easi water and he went by so close i could a reach out the gun and touch him  well it was pap sure enoughand sober too by the way he laid his oar i didnt lose no time  the next minut i was a spin down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank  i made two mile and a half and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more toward the middl of the river becaus pretti soon i would be pass the ferri land and peopl might see me and hail me  i got out amongst the driftwood and then laid down in the bottom of the cano and let her float  i laid there and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe look away into the sky not a cloud in it  the sky look ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshin i never know it befor  and how far a bodi can hear on the water such night  i heard peopl talk at the ferri land i heard what they said tooeveri word of it  one man said it was get toward the long day and the short night now  tother one said this warnt one of the short one he reckonedand then they laugh and he said it over again and they laugh again then they wake up anoth fellow and told him and laugh but he didnt laugh he rip out someth brisk and said let him alon  the first fellow said he low to tell it to his old womansh would think it was pretti good but he said that warnt noth to some thing he had said in his time i heard one man say it was near three oclock and he hope daylight wouldnt wait more than about a week longer  after that the talk got further and further away and i couldnt make out the word ani more but i could hear the mumbl and now and then a laugh too but it seem a long way off i was away below the ferri now  i rose up and there was jackson island about two mile and a half down stream heavi timber and stand up out of the middl of the river big and dark and solid like a steamboat without ani light  there warnt ani sign of the bar at the headit was all under water now it didnt take me long to get there  i shot past the head at a rip rate the current was so swift and then i got into the dead water and land on the side toward the illinoi shore  i run the cano into a deep dent in the bank that i know about i had to part the willow branch to get in and when i made fast nobodi could a seen the cano from the outsid i went up and set down on a log at the head of the island and look out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town three mile away where there was three or four light twinkl  a monstrous big lumber raft was about a mile up stream come along down with a lantern in the middl of it  i watch it come creep down and when it was most abreast of where i stood i heard a man say stern oar there heav her head to stabboard  i heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side there was a littl gray in the sky now so i step into the wood and laid down for a nap befor breakfast chapter viii the sun was up so high when i wake that i judg it was after eight oclock  i laid there in the grass and the cool shade think about thing and feel rest and ruther comfort and satisfi  i could see the sun out at one or two hole but most it was big tree all about and gloomi in there amongst them  there was freckl place on the ground where the light sift down through the leav and the freckl place swap about a littl show there was a littl breez up there  a coupl of squirrel set on a limb and jabber at me veri friend i was power lazi and comfortabledidnt want to get up and cook breakfast  well i was doze off again when i think i hear a deep sound of boom away up the river  i rous up and rest on my elbow and listen pretti soon i hear it again  i hop up and went and look out at a hole in the leav and i see a bunch of smoke lay on the water a long way upabout abreast the ferri  and there was the ferryboat full of peopl float along down  i know what was the matter now  boom i see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat side  you see they was fire cannon over the water tri to make my carcass come to the top i was pretti hungri but it warnt go to do for me to start a fire becaus they might see the smoke  so i set there and watch the cannon smoke and listen to the boom  the river was a mile wide there and it alway look pretti on a summer morningso i was have a good enough time see them hunt for my remaind if i onli had a bite to eat well then i happen to think how they alway put quicksilv in loav of bread and float them off becaus they alway go right to the drownd carcass and stop there  so say i ill keep a lookout and if ani of them float around after me ill give them a show  i chang to the illinoi edg of the island to see what luck i could have and i warnt disappoint  a big doubl loaf come along and i most got it with a long stick but my foot slip and she float out further  of cours i was where the current set in the closest to the shorei know enough for that  but by and by along come anoth one and this time i won  i took out the plug and shook out the littl dab of quicksilv and set my teeth in  it was baker breadwhat the qualiti eat none of your low down corn pone i got a good place amongst the leav and set there on a log munch the bread and watch the ferri boat and veri well satisfi  and then someth struck me  i say now i reckon the widow or the parson or somebodi pray that this bread would find me and here it has gone and done it  so there aint no doubt but there is someth in that thingthat is there someth in it when a bodi like the widow or the parson pray but it dont work for me and i reckon it dont work for onli just the right kind i lit a pipe and had a good long smoke and went on watch  the ferryboat was float with the current and i allow id have a chanc to see who was aboard when she come along becaus she would come in close where the bread did  when shed got pretti well along down toward me i put out my pipe and went to where i fish out the bread and laid down behind a log on the bank in a littl open place  where the log fork i could peep through by and by she come along and she drift in so close that they could a run out a plank and walk ashor  most everybodi was on the boat  pap and judg thatcher and bessi thatcher and jo harper and tom sawyer and his old aunt polli and sid and mari and plenti more  everybodi was talk about the murder but the captain broke in and say look sharp now the current set in the closest here and mayb hes wash ashor and got tangl amongst the brush at the water edg  i hope so anyway i didnt hope so  they all crowd up and lean over the rail near in my face and kept still watch with all their might  i could see them first rate but they couldnt see me  then the captain sung out stand away and the cannon let off such a blast right befor me that it made me deef with the nois and pretti near blind with the smoke and i judg i was gone  if theyd a had some bullet in i reckon theyd a got the corps they was after  well i see i warnt hurt thank to good the boat float on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island  i could hear the boom now and then further and further off and by and by after an hour i didnt hear it no more  the island was three mile long  i judg they had got to the foot and was give it up  but they didnt yet a while  they turn around the foot of the island and start up the channel on the missouri side under steam and boom onc in a while as they went  i cross over to that side and watch them when they got abreast the head of the island they quit shoot and drop over to the missouri shore and went home to the town i know i was all right now  nobodi els would come a hunt after me i got my trap out of the cano and made me a nice camp in the thick wood  i made a kind of a tent out of my blanket to put my thing under so the rain couldnt get at them  i catch a catfish and haggl him open with my saw and toward sundown i start my camp fire and had supper  then i set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast when it was dark i set by my camp fire smoke and feel pretti well satisfi but by and by it got sort of lonesom and so i went and set on the bank and listen to the current swash along and count the star and drift log and raft that come down and then went to bed there aint no better way to put in time when you are lonesom you cant stay so you soon get over it and so for three day and night  no differencejust the same thing but the next day i went explor around down through the island  i was boss of it it all belong to me so to say and i want to know all about it but main i want to put in the time  i found plenti strawberri ripe and prime and green summer grape and green razberri and the green blackberri was just begin to show  they would all come handi by and by i judg well i went fool along in the deep wood till i judg i warnt far from the foot of the island  i had my gun along but i hadnt shot noth it was for protect thought i would kill some game nigh home about this time i mighti near step on a good size snake and it went slide off through the grass and flower and i after it tri to get a shot at it i clip along and all of a sudden i bound right on to the ash of a camp fire that was still smoke my heart jump up amongst my lung  i never wait for to look further but uncock my gun and went sneak back on my tipto as fast as ever i could  everi now and then i stop a second amongst the thick leav and listen but my breath come so hard i couldnt hear noth els  i slunk along anoth piec further then listen again and so on and so on  if i see a stump i took it for a man if i trod on a stick and broke it it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breath in two and i onli got half and the short half too when i got to camp i warnt feel veri brash there warnt much sand in my craw but i say this aint no time to be fool around  so i got all my trap into my cano again so as to have them out of sight and i put out the fire and scatter the ash around to look like an old last year camp and then clumb a tree i reckon i was up in the tree two hour but i didnt see noth i didnt hear nothingi onli thought i heard and seen as much as a thousand thing  well i couldnt stay up there forev so at last i got down but i kept in the thick wood and on the lookout all the time all i could get to eat was berri and what was left over from breakfast by the time it was night i was pretti hungri  so when it was good and dark i slid out from shore befor moonris and paddl over to the illinoi bankabout a quarter of a mile  i went out in the wood and cook a supper and i had about made up my mind i would stay there all night when i hear a plunketi plunk plunketi plunk and say to myself hors come and next i hear peopl voic  i got everyth into the cano as quick as i could and then went creep through the wood to see what i could find out  i hadnt got far when i hear a man say we better camp here if we can find a good place the hors is about beat out  let look around i didnt wait but shove out and paddl away easi  i tie up in the old place and reckon i would sleep in the cano i didnt sleep much  i couldnt somehow for think  and everi time i wake up i thought somebodi had me by the neck  so the sleep didnt do me no good  bi and by i say to myself i cant live this way im a go to find out who it is that here on the island with me ill find it out or bust  well i felt better right off so i took my paddl and slid out from shore just a step or two and then let the cano drop along down amongst the shadow  the moon was shine and outsid of the shadow it made it most as light as day  i poke along well on to an hour everyth still as rock and sound asleep well by this time i was most down to the foot of the island  a littl rippli cool breez begun to blow and that was as good as say the night was about done  i give her a turn with the paddl and brung her nose to shore then i got my gun and slip out and into the edg of the wood  i sat down there on a log and look out through the leav  i see the moon go off watch and the dark begin to blanket the river but in a littl while i see a pale streak over the treetop and know the day was come  so i took my gun and slip off toward where i had run across that camp fire stop everi minut or two to listen  but i hadnt no luck somehow i couldnt seem to find the place  but by and by sure enough i catch a glimps of fire away through the tree  i went for it cautious and slow  bi and by i was close enough to have a look and there laid a man on the ground  it most give me the fan tod he had a blanket around his head and his head was near in the fire  i set there behind a clump of bush in about six foot of him and kept my eye on him steadi  it was get gray daylight now  pretti soon he gap and stretch himself and hove off the blanket and it was miss watson jim  i bet

look at a place right about the middl of the island that id found when i was explor so we start and soon got to it becaus the island was onli three mile long and a quarter of a mile wide this place was a toler long steep hill or ridg about forti foot high we had a rough time get to the top the side was so steep and the bush so thick  we tramp and clumb around all over it and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock most up to the top on the side toward illinoi  the cavern was as big as two or three room bunch togeth and jim could stand up straight in it  it was cool in there jim was for put our trap in there right away but i said we didnt want to be climb up and down there all the time jim said if we had the cano hid in a good place and had all the trap in the cavern we could rush there if anybodi was to come to the island and they would never find us without dog  and besid he said them littl bird had said it was go to rain and did i want the thing to get wet so we went back and got the cano and paddl up abreast the cavern and lug all the trap up there  then we hunt up a place close by to hide the cano in amongst the thick willow  we took some fish off of the line and set them again and begun to get readi for dinner the door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a littl bit and was flat and a good place to build a fire on  so we built it there and cook dinner we spread the blanket insid for a carpet and eat our dinner in there we put all the other thing handi at the back of the cavern  pretti soon it darken up and begun to thunder and lighten so the bird was right about it  direct it begun to rain and it rain like all furi too and i never see the wind blow so  it was one of these regular summer storm  it would get so dark that it look all blue black outsid and love and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the tree off a littl way look dim and spider webbi and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the tree down and turn up the pale undersid of the leav and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branch to toss their arm as if they was just wild and next when it was just about the bluest and blackest fst it was as bright as glori and youd have a littl glimps of tree top a plung about away off yonder in the storm hundr of yard further than you could see befor dark as sin again in a second and now youd hear the thunder let go with an aw crash and then go rumbl grumbl tumbl down the sky toward the under side of the world like roll empti barrel down stairswher it long stair and they bounc a good deal you know jim this is nice i say  i wouldnt want to be nowher els but here pass me along anoth hunk of fish and some hot corn bread well you wouldnt a ben here f it hadnt a ben for jim  youd a ben down dah in de wood widout ani dinner en gittn mos drownd too dat you would honey  chicken know when it gwyne to rain en so do de bird chile the river went on rais and rais for ten or twelv day till at last it was over the bank  the water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low place and on the illinoi bottom  on that side it was a good mani mile wide but on the missouri side it was the same old distanc acrossa half a milebecaus the missouri shore was just a wall of high bluff daytim we paddl all over the island in the cano it was mighti cool and shadi in the deep wood even if the sun was blaze outsid  we went wind in and out amongst the tree and sometim the vine hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way  well on everi old broken down tree you could see rabbit and snake and such thing and when the island had been overflow a day or two they got so tame on account of be hungri that you could paddl right up and put your hand on them if you want to but not the snake and turtlesthey would slide off in the water  the ridg our cavern was in was full of them we could a had pet enough if wed want them one night we catch a littl section of a lumber raftnic pine plank it was twelv foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long and the top stood abov water six or seven inchesa solid level floor  we could see saw log go by in the daylight sometim but we let them go we didnt show ourselv in daylight anoth night when we was up at the head of the island just befor daylight here come a frame hous down on the west side  she was a two stori and tilt over consider  we paddl out and got aboardclumb in at an upstair window  but it was too dark to see yet so we made the cano fast and set in her to wait for daylight the light begun to come befor we got to the foot of the island  then we look in at the window  we could make out a bed and a tabl and two old chair and lot of thing around about on the floor and there was cloth hang against the wall  there was someth lay on the floor in the far corner that look like a man  so jim say hello you but it didnt budg  so i holler again and then jim say de man aint asleeph dead  you hold stillil go en see he went and bent down and look and say it a dead man  ye indeedi nake too  hes ben shot in de back i reckn hes ben dead two er three day  come in huck but doan look at his faceit too gash i didnt look at him at all  jim throw some old rag over him but he neednt done it i didnt want to see him  there was heap of old greasi card scatter around over the floor and old whiski bottl and a coupl of mask made out of black cloth and all over the wall was the ignorantest kind of word and pictur made with charcoal  there was two old dirti calico dress and a sun bonnet and some women undercloth hang against the wall and some men cloth too  we put the lot into the canoeit might come good  there was a boy old speckl straw hat on the floor i took that too  and there was a bottl that had had milk in it and it had a rag stopper for a babi to suck  we would a took the bottl but it was broke  there was a seedi old chest and an old hair trunk with the hing broke  they stood open but there warnt noth left in them that was ani account  the way thing was scatter about we reckon the peopl left in a hurri and warnt fix so as to carri off most of their stuff we got an old tin lantern and a butcher knife without ani handl and a bran new barlow knife worth two bit in ani store and a lot of tallow candl and a tin candlestick and a gourd and a tin cup and a ratti old bedquilt off the bed and a reticul with needl and pin and beeswax and button and thread and all such truck in it and a hatchet and some nail and a fishlin as thick as my littl finger with some monstrous hook on it and a roll of buckskin and a leather dog collar and a horsesho and some vial of medicin that didnt have no label on them and just as we was leav i found a toler good curri comb and jim he found a ratti old fiddl bow and a wooden leg  the strap was broke off of it but bar that it was a good enough leg though it was too long for me and not long enough for jim and we couldnt find the other one though we hunt all around and so take it all around we made a good haul  when we was readi to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island and it was pretti broad day so i made jim lay down in the cano and cover up with the quilt becaus if he set up peopl could tell he was a nigger a good way off  i paddl over to the illinoi shore and drift down most a half a mile do it  i crept up the dead water under the bank and hadnt no accid and didnt see nobodi  we got home all safe chapter x after breakfast i want to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be kill but jim didnt want to  he said it would fetch bad luck and besid he said he might come and hant us he said a man that warnt buri was more like to go a hant around than one that was plant and comfort  that sound pretti reason so i didnt say no more but i couldnt keep from studi over it and wish i know who shot the man and what they done it for we rummag the cloth wed got and found eight dollar in silver sew up in the line of an old blanket overcoat  jim said he reckon the peopl in that hous stole the coat becaus if theyd a know the money was there they wouldnt a left it  i said i reckon they kill him too but jim didnt want to talk about that  i say now you think it bad luck but what did you say when i fetch in the snake skin that i found on the top of the ridg day befor yesterday you said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake skin with my hand  well here your bad luck  weve rake in all this truck and eight dollar besid  i wish we could have some bad luck like this everi day jim never you mind honey never you mind  dont you git too peart  it a comin  mind i tell you it a comin it did come too  it was a tuesday that we had that talk  well after dinner friday we was lay around in the grass at the upper end of the ridg and got out of tobacco  i went to the cavern to get some and found a rattlesnak in there  i kill him and curl him up on the foot of jim blanket ever so natur think there be some fun when jim found him there  well by night i forgot all about the snake and when jim flung himself down on the blanket while i struck a light the snake mate was there and bit him he jump up yell and the first thing the light show was the varmint curl up and readi for anoth spring  i laid him out in a second with a stick and jim grab pap whiski jug and begun to pour it down he was barefoot and the snake bit him right on the heel  that all come of my be such a fool as to not rememb that wherev you leav a dead snake it mate alway come there and curl around it  jim told me to chop off the snake head and throw it away and then skin the bodi and roast a piec of it  i done it and he eat it and said it would help cure him he made me take off the rattl and tie them around his wrist too  he said that that would help  then i slid out quiet and throw the snake clear away amongst the bush for i warnt go to let jim find out it was all my fault not if i could help it jim suck and suck at the jug and now and then he got out of his head and pitch around and yell but everi time he come to himself he went to suck at the jug again  his foot swell up pretti big and so did his leg but by and by the drunk begun to come and so i judg he was all right but id druther been bit with a snake than pap whiski jim was laid up for four day and night  then the swell was all gone and he was around again  i made up my mind i wouldnt ever take a holt of a snake skin again with my hand now that i see what had come of it jim said he reckon i would believ him next time  and he said that handl a snake skin was such aw bad luck that mayb we hadnt got to the end of it yet  he said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand time than take up a snake skin in his hand  well i was get to feel that way myself though ive alway reckon that look at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest thing a bodi can do  old hank bunker done it onc and brag about it and in less than two year he got drunk and fell off of the shot tower and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer as you may say and they slid him edgeway between two barn door for a coffin and buri him so so they say but i didnt see it  pap told me  but anyway it all come of look at the moon that way like a fool well the day went along and the river went down between it bank again and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hook with a skin rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man be six foot two inch long and weigh over two hundr pound we couldnt handl him of cours he would a flung us into illinoi  we just set there and watch him rip and tear around till he drownd  we found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball and lot of rubbag  we split the ball open with the hatchet and there was a spool in it  jim said hed had it there a long time to coat it over so and make a ball of it  it was as big a fish as was ever catch in the mississippi i reckon  jim said he hadnt ever seen a bigger one  he would a been worth a good deal over at the villag  they peddl out such a fish as that by the pound in the market hous there everybodi buy some of him his meat as white as snow and make a good fri next morn i said it was get slow and dull and i want to get a stir up some way  i said i reckon i would slip over the river and find out what was go on  jim like that notion but he said i must go in the dark and look sharp  then he studi it over and said couldnt i put on some of them old thing and dress up like a girl  that was a good notion too  so we shorten up one of the calico gown and i turn up my trouser leg to my knee and got into it  jim hitch it behind with the hook and it was a fair fit  i put on the sun bonnet and tie it under my chin and then for a bodi to look in and see my face was like look down a joint of stove pipe  jim said nobodi would know me even in the daytim hard  i practic around all day to get the hang of the thing and by and by i could do pretti well in them onli jim said i didnt walk like a girl and he said i must quit pull up my gown to get at my britch pocket  i took notic and done better i start up the illinoi shore in the cano just after dark i start across to the town from a littl below the ferri land and the drift of the current fetch me in at the bottom of the town  i tie up and start along the bank  there was a light burn in a littl shanti that hadnt been live in for a long time and i wonder who had took up quarter there  i slip up and peep in at the window  there was a woman about forti year old in there knit by a candl that was on a pine tabl  i didnt know her face she was a stranger for you couldnt start a face in that town that i didnt know  now this was lucki becaus i was weaken i was get afraid i had come peopl might know my voic and find me out  but if this

and your feetll be in a condit when you get to goshen i reckon i went up the bank about fifti yard and then i doubl on my track and slip back to where my cano was a good piec below the hous  i jump in and was off in a hurri  i went up stream far enough to make the head of the island and then start across  i took off the sun bonnet for i didnt want no blinder on then  when i was about the middl i heard the clock begin to strike so i stop and listen the sound come faint over the water but cleareleven  when i struck the head of the island i never wait to blow though i was most wind but i shove right into the timber where my old camp use to be and start a good fire there on a high and dri spot then i jump in the cano and dug out for our place a mile and a half below as hard as i could go  i land and slop through the timber and up the ridg and into the cavern  there jim laid sound asleep on the ground  i rous him out and say git up and hump yourself jim  there aint a minut to lose  theyr after us jim never ask no question he never said a word but the way he work for the next half an hour show about how he was scare  bi that time everyth we had in the world was on our raft and she was readi to be shove out from the willow cove where she was hid  we put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing and didnt show a candl outsid after that i took the cano out from the shore a littl piec and took a look but if there was a boat around i couldnt see it for star and shadow aint good to see by  then we got out the raft and slip along down in the shade past the foot of the island dead stillnev say a word chapter xii it must a been close on to one oclock when we got below the island at last and the raft did seem to go mighti slow  if a boat was to come along we was go to take to the cano and break for the illinoi shore and it was well a boat didnt come for we hadnt ever thought to put the gun in the cano or a fish line or anyth to eat  we was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so mani thing  it warnt good judgment to put everyth on the raft if the men went to the island i just expect they found the camp fire i built and watch it all night for jim to come  anyway they stay away from us and if my build the fire never fool them it warnt no fault of mine  i play it as low down on them as i could when the first streak of day began to show we tie up to a towhead in a big bend on the illinoi side and hack off cottonwood branch with the hatchet and cover up the raft with them so she look like there had been a cave in in the bank there  a tow head is a sandbar that has cottonwood on it as thick as harrow teeth we had mountain on the missouri shore and heavi timber on the illinoi side and the channel was down the missouri shore at that place so we warnt afraid of anybodi run across us  we laid there all day and watch the raft and steamboat spin down the missouri shore and up bound steamboat fight the big river in the middl  i told jim all about the time i had jabber with that woman and jim said she was a smart one and if she was to start after us herself she wouldnt set down and watch a camp fireno sir shed fetch a dog  well then i said whi couldnt she tell her husband to fetch a dog  jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was readi to start and he believ they must a gone up town to get a dog and so they lost all that time or els we wouldnt be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the villageno indeedi we would be in that same old town again  so i said i didnt care what was the reason they didnt get us as long as they didnt when it was begin to come on dark we poke our head out of the cottonwood thicket and look up and down and across noth in sight so jim took up some of the top plank of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blaze weather and raini and to keep the thing dri jim made a floor for the wigwam and rais it a foot or more abov the level of the raft so now the blanket and all the trap was out of reach of steamboat wave  right in the middl of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inch deep with a frame around it for to hold it to it place this was to build a fire on in sloppi weather or chilli the wigwam would keep it from be seen  we made an extra steer oar too becaus one of the other might get broke on a snag or someth we fix up a short fork stick to hang the old lantern on becaus we must alway light the lantern whenev we see a steamboat come down stream to keep from get run over but we wouldnt have to light it for up stream boat unless we see we was in what they call a cross for the river was pretti high yet veri low bank be still a littl under water so up bound boat didnt alway run the channel but hunt easi water this second night we run between seven and eight hour with a current that was make over four mile an hour  we catch fish and talk and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepi  it was kind of solemn drift down the big still river lay on our back look up at the star and we didnt ever feel like talk loud and it warnt often that we laughedon a littl kind of a low chuckl  we had mighti good weather as a general thing and noth ever happen to us at allthat night nor the next nor the next everi night we pass town some of them away up on black hillsid noth but just a shini bed of light not a hous could you see  the fifth night we pass st loui and it was like the whole world lit up in st petersburg they use to say there was twenti or thirti thousand peopl in st loui but i never believ it till i see that wonder spread of light at two oclock that still night  there warnt a sound there everybodi was asleep everi night now i use to slip ashor toward ten oclock at some littl villag and buy ten or fifteen cent worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat and sometim i lift a chicken that warnt roost comfort and took him along  pap alway said take a chicken when you get a chanc becaus if you dont want him yourself you can easi find somebodi that doe and a good deed aint ever forgot  i never see pap when he didnt want the chicken himself but that is what he use to say anyway morn befor daylight i slip into cornfield and borrow a watermelon or a mushmelon or a punkin or some new corn or thing of that kind  pap alway said it warnt no harm to borrow thing if you was mean to pay them back some time but the widow said it warnt anyth but a soft name for steal and no decent bodi would do it  jim said he reckon the widow was part right and pap was part right so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three thing from the list and say we wouldnt borrow them ani morethen he reckon it wouldnt be no harm to borrow the other  so we talk it over all one night drift along down the river tri to make up our mind whether to drop the watermelon or the cantelop or the mushmelon or what  but toward daylight we got it all settl satisfactori and conclud to drop crabappl and psimmon  we warnt feel just right befor that but it was all comfort now  i was glad the way it come out too becaus crabappl aint ever good and the psimmon wouldnt be ripe for two or three month yet we shot a water fowl now and then that got up too earli in the morn or didnt go to bed earli enough in the even  take it all round we live pretti high the fifth night below st loui we had a big storm after midnight with a power of thunder and lightn and the rain pour down in a solid sheet we stay in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself when the lightn glare out we could see a big straight river ahead and high rocki bluff on both side  bi and by say i hel lo jim looki yonder it was a steamboat that had kill herself on a rock  we was drift straight down for her  the lightn show her veri distinct  she was lean over with part of her upper deck abov water and you could see everi littl chimbl guy clean and clear and a chair by the big bell with an old slouch hat hang on the back of it when the flash come well it be away in the night and stormi and all so mysteri like i felt just the way ani other boy would a felt when i see that wreck lay there so mourn and lonesom in the middl of the river  i want to get aboard of her and slink around a littl and see what there was there  so i say les land on her jim but jim was dead against it at first  he say i doan want to go fooln long er no wrack  wes doin blame well en we better let blame well alon as de good book say  like as not dey a watchman on dat wrack watchman your grandmoth i say there aint noth to watch but the texa and the pilot hous and do you reckon anybodi go to resk his life for a texa and a pilot hous such a night as this when it like to break up and wash off down the river ani minut  jim couldnt say noth to that so he didnt tri  and besid i say we might borrow someth worth have out of the captain stateroom  seegar i bet youand cost five cent apiec solid cash  steamboat captain is alway rich and get sixti dollar a month and they dont care a cent what a thing cost you know long as they want it  stick a candl in your pocket i cant rest jim till we give her a rummag  do you reckon tom sawyer would ever go by this thing  not for pie he wouldnt hed call it an adventurethat what hed call it and hed land on that wreck if it was his last act  and wouldnt he throw style into itwouldnt he spread himself nor noth  whi youd think it was christoph clumbus discov kingdom come  i wish tom sawyer was here jim he grumbl a littl but give in  he said we mustnt talk ani more than we could help and then talk mighti low  the lightn show us the wreck again just in time and we fetch the stabboard derrick and made fast there the deck was high out here  we went sneak down the slope of it to labboard in the dark toward the texa feel our way slow with our feet and spread our hand out to fend off the guy for it was so dark we couldnt see no sign of them  pretti soon we struck the forward end of the skylight and clumb on to it and the next step fetch us in front of the captain door which was open and by jimmini away down through the texa hall we see a light and all in the same second we seem to hear low voic in yonder jim whisper and said he was feel power sick and told me to come along  i say all right and was go to start for the raft but just then i heard a voic wail out and say oh pleas dont boy i swear i wont ever tell anoth voic said pretti loud it a lie jim turner  youv act this way befor  you alway want moren your share of the truck and youv alway got it too becaus youv swore t if you didnt youd tell  but this time youv said it jest one time too mani  your the meanest treacherousest hound in this countri by this time jim was gone for the raft  i was just a bile with curios and i say to myself tom sawyer wouldnt back out now and so i wont either im a go to see what go on here  so i drop on my hand and knee in the littl passag and crept aft in the dark till there warnt but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross hall of the texa  then in there i see a man stretch on the floor and tie hand and foot and two men stand over him and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand and the other one had a pistol  this one kept point the pistol at the man head on the floor and say id like to  and i orter tooa mean skunk the man on the floor would shrivel up and say oh pleas dont bill i haint ever goin to tell and everi time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say deed you aint  you never said no truer thing n that you bet you and onc he said  hear him beg and yit if we hadnt got the best of him and tie him hed a kill us both  and what for  jist for nothn jist becaus we stood on our right that what for  but i lay you aint a goin to threaten nobodi ani more jim turner  put up that pistol bill bill say i dont want to jake packard  im for killin himand didnt he kill old hatfield jist the same wayand dont he deserv it but i dont want him kill and ive got my reason for it bless yo heart for them word jake packard  ill never forgit you long i live say the man on the floor sort of blubber packard didnt take no notic of that but hung up his lantern on a nail and start toward where i was there in the dark and motion bill to come  i crawfish as fast as i could about two yard but the boat slant so that i couldnt make veri good time so to keep from get run over and catch i crawl into a stateroom on the upper side  the man came a paw along in the dark and when packard got to my stateroom he say herecom in here and in he come and bill after him  but befor they got in i was up in the upper berth corner and sorri i come  then they stood there with their hand on the ledg of the berth and talk  i couldnt see them but i could tell where they was by the whiski theyd been have  i was glad i didnt drink whiski but it wouldnt made much differ anyway becaus most of the time they couldnt a treed me becaus i didnt breath  i was too scare  and besid a bodi couldnt breath and hear such talk  they talk low and earnest  bill want to kill turner  he say hes said hell tell and he will  if we was to give both our share to him now it wouldnt make no differ after the row and the way weve serv him  shore your born hell turn state evid now you hear me  im for put him out of his troubl som i say packard veri quiet blame it id sorter begun to think you wasnt  well then that all right  les go and do it hold on a minut i haint had my say yit  you listen to me shoot good but there quieter way if the thing got to be done but what i say is this  it aint good sens to go courtn around after a halter if you can git at what your up to in some way that jist as good and at the same time dont bring you into no resk  aint that so you bet it is  but how you goin to manag it this time well my idea is this  well rustl around and gather up whatev pickin weve overlook in the stateroom and shove for shore and hide the truck then well wait  now i say it aint a goin to be moren two hour befo this wrack break up and wash off down the river  see hell be drownd and wont have nobodi to blame for it but his own self  i reckon that a considerbl sight better n killin of him  im unfavor to killin a man as long as you can git aroun it it aint good sens it aint good moral  aint i right yes i reckn you are  but spose she dont break up and wash off well we can wait the two hour anyway and see cant we all right then come along so they start and i lit out all in a cold sweat and scrambl forward it was dark as pitch there but i said in a kind of a coars whisper jim and he answer up right at my elbow with a sort of a moan and i say quick jim it aint no time for fool around and moan there a gang of murder in yonder and if we dont hunt up their boat and set her drift down the river so these fellow cant get away from the wreck there one of em go to be in a bad fix  but if we find their boat we can put all of em in a bad fixfor the sheriff ll get em quickhurri  ill hunt the labboard side you hunt the stabboard you start at the raft and oh my lordi lordi   raf  dey ain no raf no mo she done broke loos en gone ien here we is chapter xiii well i catch my breath and most faint  shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that  but it warnt no time to be sentiment  wed got to find that boat nowhad to have it for ourselv  so we went a quak and shake down the stabboard side and slow work it was tooseem a week befor we got to the stern  no sign of a boat  jim said he didnt believ he could go ani furtherso scare he hadnt hard ani strength left he said  but i said come on if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix sure  so on we prowl again  we struck for the stern of the texa and found it and then scrabbl along forward on the skylight hang on from shutter to shutter for the edg of the skylight was in the water  when we got pretti close to the cross hall door there was the skiff sure enough  i could just bare see her  i felt ever so thank  in anoth second i would a been aboard of her but just then the door open  one of the men stuck his head out onli about a coupl of foot from me and i thought i was gone but he jerk it in again and say heav that blame lantern out o sight bill he flung a bag of someth into the boat and then got in himself and set down  it was packard  then bill he come out and got in  packard say in a low voic all readyshov off i couldnt hard hang on to the shutter i was so weak  but bill say hold ond you go through him no  didnt you no  so hes got his share o the cash yet well then come along no use to take truck and leav money say wont he suspicion what were up to mayb he wont  but we got to have it anyway come along so they got out and went in the door slam to becaus it was on the careen side and in a half second i was in the boat and jim come tumbl after me  i out with my knife and cut the rope and away we went we didnt touch an oar and we didnt speak nor whisper nor hard even breath  we went glide swift along dead silent past the tip of the paddl box and past the stern then in a second or two more we was a hundr yard below the wreck and the dark soak her up everi last sign of her and we was safe and know it when we was three or four hundr yard down stream we see the lantern show like a littl spark at the texa door for a second and we know by that that the rascal had miss their boat and was begin to understand that they was in just as much troubl now as jim turner was then jim man the oar and we took out after our raft  now was the first time that i begun to worri about the meni reckon i hadnt had time to befor  i begun to think how dread it was even for murder to be in such a fix  i say to myself there aint no tell but i might come to be a murder myself yet and then how would i like it  so say i to jim the first light we see well land a hundr yard below it or abov it in a place where it a good hide place for you and the skiff and then ill go and fix up some kind of a yarn and get somebodi to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape so they can be hung when their time come but that idea was a failur for pretti soon it begun to storm again and this time wors than ever  the rain pour down and never a light show everybodi in bed i reckon  we boom along down the river watch for light and watch for our raft  after a long time the rain let up but the cloud stay and the lightn kept whimper and by and by a flash show us a black thing ahead float and we made for it it was the raft and mighti glad was we to get aboard of it again  we seen a light now away down to the right on shore  so i said i would go for it the skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck  we hustl it on to the raft in a pile and i told jim to float along down and show a light when he judg he had gone about two mile and keep it burn till i come then i man my oar and shove for the light  as i got down toward it three or four more showedup on a hillsid  it was a villag  i close in abov the shore light and laid on my oar and float  as i went by i see it was a lantern hang on the jackstaff of a doubl hull ferryboat  i skim around for the watchman a wonder whereabout he slept and by and by i found him roost on the bitt forward with his head down between his knee  i gave his shoulder two or three littl shove and begun to cri he stir up in a kind of a startlish way but when he see it was onli me he took a good gap and stretch and then he say hello what up  dont cri bub  what the troubl i say pap and mam and sis and then i broke down  he say oh dang it now dont take on so we all has to have our troubl and this n ll come out all right  what the matter with em theyretheyrear you the watchman of the boat yes he say kind of pretti well satisfi like  im the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deck hand and sometim im the freight and passeng  i aint as rich as old jim hornback and i cant be so blame generous and good to tom dick and harri as what he is and slam around money the way he doe but ive told him a mani a time t i wouldnt trade place with him for say i a sailor life the life for me and im dern if id live two mile out o town where there aint noth ever goin on not for all his spondulick and as much more on top of it  say i i broke in and say theyr in an aw peck of troubl and who is whi pap and mam and sis and miss hooker and if youd take your ferryboat and go up there up where  where are they on the wreck what wreck whi there aint but one what you dont mean the walter scott yes good land what are they doin there for gracious sake well they didnt go there a purpos i bet they didnt  whi great good there aint no chanc for em if they dont git off mighti quick  whi how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape easi enough  miss hooker was a visit up there to the town yes booth landinggo on she was a visit there at booth land and just in the edg of the even she start over with her nigger woman in the hors ferri to stay all night at her friend hous miss what you may call her i disrememb her nameand they lost their steer oar and swung around and went a float down stern first about two mile and saddl baggs on the wreck and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the hors was all lost but miss hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck  well about an hour after dark we come along down in our trade scow and it was so dark we didnt notic the wreck till we was right on it and so we saddl baggs but all of us was save but bill whippleand oh he was the best creturi most wish t it had been me i do my georg  it the beatenest thing i ever struck  and then what did you all do well we holler and took on but it so wide there we couldnt make nobodi hear  so pap said somebodi got to get ashor and get help somehow i was the onli one that could swim so i made a dash for it and miss hooker she said if i didnt strike help sooner come here and hunt up her uncl and hed fix the thing  i made the land about a mile below and been fool along ever sinc tri to get peopl to do someth but they said what in such a night and such a current there aint no sens in it go for the steam ferri  now if youll go and by jackson id like to and blame it i dont know but i will but who in the dingnat a go to pay for it  do you reckon your pap whi that all right  miss hooker she tole me particular that her uncl hornback great gun is he her uncl  looki here you break for that light over yonder way and turn out west when you git there and about a quarter of a mile out youll come to the tavern tell em to dart you out to jim hornback and hell foot the bill  and dont you fool around ani becaus hell want to know the news  tell him ill have his niec all safe befor he can get to town  hump yourself now im a go up around the corner here to roust out my engin i struck for the light but as soon as he turn the corner i went back and got into my skiff and bail her out and then pull up shore in the easi water about six hundr yard and tuck myself in among some woodboat for i couldnt rest easi till i could see the ferryboat start but take it all around i was feel ruther comfort on account of take all this troubl for that gang for not mani would a done it  i wish the widow know about it  i judg she would be proud of me for help these rapscallion becaus rapscallion and dead beat is the kind the widow and good peopl take the most interest in well befor long here come the wreck dim and duski slide along down a kind of cold shiver went through me and then i struck out for her  she was veri deep and i see in a minut there warnt much chanc for anybodi be aliv in her  i pull all around her and holler a littl but there wasnt ani answer all dead still  i felt a littl bit heavi heart about the gang but not much for i reckon if they could stand it i could then here come the ferryboat so i shove for the middl of the river on a long down stream slant and when i judg i was out of eye reach i laid on my oar and look back and see her go and smell around the wreck for miss hooker remaind becaus the captain would know her uncl hornback would want them and then pretti soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore and i laid into my work and went a boom down the river it did seem a power long time befor jim light show up and when it did show it look like it was a thousand mile off  bi the time i got there the sky was begin to get a littl gray in the east so we struck for an island and hid the raft and sunk the skiff and turn in and slept like dead peopl chapter xiv by and by when we got up we turn over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck and found boot and blanket and cloth and all sort of other thing and a lot of book and a spyglass and three box of seegar  we hadnt ever been this rich befor in neither of our live  the seegar was prime  we laid off all the afternoon in the wood talk and me read the book and have a general good time i told jim all about what happen insid the wreck and at the ferryboat and i said these kind of thing was adventur but he said he didnt want no more adventur  he said that when i went in the texa and he crawl back to get on the raft and found her gone he near die becaus he judg it was all up with him anyway it could be fix for if he didnt get save he would get drownd and if he did get save whoever save him would send him back home so as to get the reward and then miss watson would sell him south sure  well he was right he was most alway right he had an uncommon level head for a nigger i read consider to jim about king and duke and earl and such and

chapter xv we judg that three night more would fetch us to cairo at the bottom of illinoi where the ohio river come in and that was what we was after  we would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the ohio amongst the free state and then be out of troubl well the second night a fog begun to come on and we made for a towhead to tie to for it wouldnt do to tri to run in a fog but when i paddl ahead in the cano with the line to make fast there warnt anyth but littl sapl to tie to  i pass the line around one of them right on the edg of the cut bank but there was a stiff current and the raft come boom down so live she tore it out by the root and away she went  i see the fog close down and it made me so sick and scare i couldnt budg for most a half a minut it seem to meand then there warnt no raft in sight you couldnt see twenti yard  i jump into the cano and run back to the stern and grab the paddl and set her back a stroke  but she didnt come  i was in such a hurri i hadnt unti her  i got up and tri to unti her but i was so excit my hand shook so i couldnt hard do anyth with them as soon as i got start i took out after the raft hot and heavi right down the towhead  that was all right as far as it went but the towhead warnt sixti yard long and the minut i flew by the foot of it i shot out into the solid white fog and hadnt no more idea which way i was go than a dead man think i it wont do to paddl first i know ill run into the bank or a towhead or someth i got to set still and float and yet it mighti fidgeti busi to have to hold your hand still at such a time  i whoop and listen  away down there somewher i hear a small whoop and up come my spirit  i went tear after it listen sharp to hear it again  the next time it come i see i warnt head for it but head away to the right of it  and the next time i was head away to the left of itand not gain on it much either for i was fli around this way and that and tother but it was go straight ahead all the time i did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan and beat it all the time but he never did and it was the still place between the whoop that was make the troubl for me  well i fought along and direct i hear the whoop behind me  i was tangl good now  that was somebodi els whoop or els i was turn around i throw the paddl down  i heard the whoop again it was behind me yet but in a differ place it kept come and kept chang it place and i kept answer till by and by it was in front of me again and i know the current had swung the cano head down stream and i was all right if that was jim and not some other raftsman holler  i couldnt tell noth about voic in a fog for noth dont look natur nor sound natur in a fog the whoop went on and in about a minut i come a boom down on a cut bank with smoki ghost of big tree on it and the current throw me off to the left and shot by amongst a lot of snag that fair roar the currrent was tear by them so swift in anoth second or two it was solid white and still again  i set perfect still then listen to my heart thump and i reckon i didnt draw a breath while it thump a hundr i just give up then  i know what the matter was  that cut bank was an island and jim had gone down tother side of it  it warnt no towhead that you could float by in ten minut  it had the big timber of a regular island it might be five or six mile long and more than half a mile wide i kept quiet with my ear cock about fifteen minut i reckon  i was float along of cours four or five mile an hour but you dont ever think of that  no you feel like you are lay dead still on the water and if a littl glimps of a snag slip by you dont think to yourself how fast your go but you catch your breath and think my how that snag tear along  if you think it aint dismal and lonesom out in a fog that way by yourself in the night you tri it onceyoul see next for about a half an hour i whoop now and then at last i hear the answer a long way off and tri to follow it but i couldnt do it and direct i judg id got into a nest of towhead for i had littl dim glimps of them on both side of mesometim just a narrow channel between and some that i couldnt see i know was there becaus id hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the bank  well i warnt long loos the whoop down amongst the towhead and i onli tri to chase them a littl while anyway becaus it was wors than chase a jack o lantern  you never know a sound dodg around so and swap place so quick and so much i had to claw away from the bank pretti live four or five time to keep from knock the island out of the river and so i judg the raft must be but into the bank everi now and then or els it would get further ahead and clear out of hearingit was float a littl faster than what i was well i seem to be in the open river again by and by but i couldnt hear no sign of a whoop nowher  i reckon jim had fetch up on a snag mayb and it was all up with him  i was good and tire so i laid down in the cano and said i wouldnt bother no more  i didnt want to go to sleep of cours but i was so sleepi i couldnt help it so i thought i would take jest one littl cat nap but i reckon it was more than a cat nap for when i wake up the star was shine bright the fog was all gone and i was spin down a big bend stern first  first i didnt know where i was i thought i was dream and when thing began to come back to me they seem to come up dim out of last week it was a monstrous big river here with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both bank just a solid wall as well as i could see by the star  i look away down stream and seen a black speck on the water i took after it but when i got to it it warnt noth but a coupl of sawlog made fast togeth  then i see anoth speck and chase that then anoth and this time i was right  it was the raft when i got to it jim was set there with his head down between his knee asleep with his right arm hang over the steer oar  the other oar was smash off and the raft was litter up with leav and branch and dirt  so shed had a rough time i made fast and laid down under jim nose on the raft and began to gap and stretch my fist out against jim and say

plain to me as it dont make no differ how plain it is there aint noth in it i know becaus ive been here all the time jim didnt say noth for about five minut but set there studi over it  then he say well den i reckn i did dream it huck but dog my cat ef it aint de powerfullest dream i ever see  en i haint ever had no dream bfo dat tire me like dis one oh well that all right becaus a dream doe tire a bodi like everyth sometim  but this one was a stave dream tell me all about it jim so jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through just as it happen onli he paint it up consider  then he said he must start in and terpret it becaus it was sent for a warn  he said the first towhead stood for a man that would tri to do us some good but the current was anoth man that would get us away from him  the whoop was warn that would come to us everi now and then and if we didnt tri hard to make out to understand them theyd just take us into bad luck stead of keep us out of it  the lot of towhead was troubl we was go to get into with quarrelsom peopl and all kind of mean folk but if we mind our busi and didnt talk back and aggrav them we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river which was the free state and wouldnt have no more troubl it had cloud up pretti dark just after i got on to the raft but it was clear up again now oh well that all interpret well enough as far as it goe jim i say but what doe these thing stand for it was the leav and rubbish on the raft and the smash oar  you could see them first rate now jim look at the trash and then look at me and back at the trash again  he had got the dream fix so strong in his head that he couldnt seem to shake it loos and get the fact back into it place again right away  but when he did get the thing straighten around he look at me steadi without ever smile and say what do dey stan for  ise gwyne to tell you  when i got all wore out wid work en wid de callin for you en went to sleep my heart wuz mos broke bekas you wuz los en i didn kyer no mo what becom er me en de raf  en when i wake up en fine you back agin all safe en soun de tear come en i could a got down on my knee en kiss yo foot is so thank en all you wuz thinkin bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole jim wid a lie  dat truck dah is trash en trash is what peopl is dat put dirt on de head er dey fren en make em asham then he got up slow and walk to the wigwam and went in there without say anyth but that  but that was enough  it made me feel so mean i could almost kiss his foot to get him to take it back it was fifteen minut befor i could work myself up to go and humbl myself to a nigger but i done it and i warnt ever sorri for it afterward neither  i didnt do him no more mean trick and i wouldnt done that one if id a know it would make him feel that way chapter xvi we slept most all day and start out at night a littl way behind a monstrous long raft that was as long go by as a process  she had four long sweep at each end so we judg she carri as mani as thirti men like  she had five big wigwam aboard wide apart and an open camp fire in the middl and a tall flag pole at each end  there was a power of style about her  it amount to someth be a raftsman on such a craft as that we went drift down into a big bend and the night cloud up and got hot  the river was veri wide and was wall with solid timber on both side you couldnt see a break in it hard ever or a light  we talk about cairo and wonder whether we would know it when we got to it  i said like we wouldnt becaus i had heard say there warnt but about a dozen hous there and if they didnt happen to have them lit up how was we go to know we was pass a town  jim said if the two big river join togeth there that would show  but i said mayb we might think we was pass the foot of an island and come into the same old river again that disturb jimand me too  so the question was what to do  i said paddl ashor the first time a light show and tell them pap was behind come along with a trade scow and was a green hand at the busi and want to know how far it was to cairo  jim thought it was a good idea so we took a smoke on it and wait there warnt noth to do now but to look out sharp for the town and not pass it without see it  he said hed be mighti sure to see it becaus hed be a free man the minut he seen it but if he miss it hed be in a slave countri again and no more show for freedom  everi littl while he jump up and say dah she is but it warnt  it was jack o lantern or lightn bug so he set down again and went to watch same as befor  jim said it made him all over trembl and feverish to be so close to freedom  well i can tell you it made me all over trembl and feverish too to hear him becaus i begun to get it through my head that he was most freeand who was to blame for it  whi me  i couldnt get that out of my conscienc no how nor no way it got to troubl me so i couldnt rest i couldnt stay still in one place  it hadnt ever come home to me befor what this thing was that i was do  but now it did and it stay with me and scorch me more and more  i tri to make out to myself that i warnt to blame becaus i didnt run jim off from his right owner but it warnt no use conscienc up and say everi time but you know he was run for his freedom and you could a paddl ashor and told somebodi  that was soi couldnt get around that noway  that was where it pinch  conscienc say to me what had poor miss watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eye and never say one singl word  what did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean  whi she tri to learn you your book she tri to learn you your manner she tri to be good to you everi way she know how   that what she done i got to feel so mean and so miser i most wish i was dead  i fidget up and down the raft abus myself to myself and jim was fidget up and down past me  we neither of us could keep still  everi time he danc around and say dah cairo it went through me like a shot and i thought if it was cairo i reckon i would die of miser jim talk out loud all the time while i was talk to myself  he was say how the first thing he would do when he got to a free state he would go to save up money and never spend a singl cent and when he got enough he would buy his wife which was own on a farm close to where miss watson live and then they would both work to buy the two children and if their master wouldnt sell them theyd get an ablitionist to go and steal them it most froze me to hear such talk  he wouldnt ever dare to talk such talk in his life befor  just see what a differ it made in him the minut he judg he was about free  it was accord to the old say give a nigger an inch and hell take an ell  think i this is what come of my not think  here was this nigger which i had as good as help to run away come right out flat foot and say he would steal his childrenchildren that belong to a man i didnt even know a man that hadnt ever done me no harm i was sorri to hear jim say that it was such a lower of him  mi conscienc got to stir me up hotter than ever until at last i say to it let up on meit aint too late yetil paddl ashor at the first light and tell  i felt easi and happi and light as a feather right off  all my troubl was gone  i went to look out sharp for a light and sort of sing to myself

the money would last us as far as we want to go in the free state he said twenti mile more warnt far for the raft to go but he wish we was alreadi there toward daybreak we tie up and jim was mighti particular about hide the raft good  then he work all day fix thing in bundl and get all readi to quit raft that night about ten we hove in sight of the light of a town away down in a left hand bend i went off in the cano to ask about it  pretti soon i found a man out in the river with a skiff set a trot line  i rang up and say mister is that town cairo cairo no  you must be a blame fool what town is it mister if you want to know go and find out  if you stay here botherin around me for about a half a minut longer youll get someth you wont want i paddl to the raft  jim was aw disappoint but i said never mind cairo would be the next place i reckon we pass anoth town befor daylight and i was go out again but it was high ground so i didnt go  no high ground about cairo jim said i had forgot it  we laid up for the day on a towhead toler close to the left hand bank  i begun to suspicion someth  so did jim  i say mayb we went by cairo in the fog that night he say doan les talk about it huck  po nigger cant have no luck  i awluz spect dat rattlesnak skin warnt done wid it work i wish id never seen that snake skin jimi do wish id never laid eye on it it aint yo fault huck you didn know  dont you blame yoself bout it when it was daylight here was the clear ohio water inshor sure enough and outsid was the old regular muddi  so it was all up with cairo we talk it all over  it wouldnt do to take to the shore we couldnt take the raft up the stream of cours  there warnt no way but to wait for dark and start back in the cano and take the chanc  so we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket so as to be fresh for the work and when we went back to the raft about dark the cano was gone we didnt say a word for a good while  there warnt anyth to say  we both know well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnak skin so what was the use to talk about it  it would onli look like we was find fault and that would be bound to fetch more bad luckand keep on fetch it too till we know enough to keep still by and by we talk about what we better do and found there warnt no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chanc to buy a cano to go back in  we warnt go to borrow it when there warnt anybodi around the way pap would do for that might set peopl after us so we shove out after dark on the raft anybodi that dont believ yet that it foolish to handl a snake skin after all that that snake skin done for us will believ it now if they read on and see what more it done for us the place to buy cano is off of raft lay up at shore  but we didnt see no raft lay up so we went along dure three hour and more  well the night got gray and ruther thick which is the next meanest thing to fog  you cant tell the shape of the river and you cant see no distanc it got to be veri late and still and then along come a steamboat up the river  we lit the lantern and judg she would see it  up stream boat didnt gener come close to us they go out and follow the bar and hunt for easi water under the reef but night like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river we could hear her pound along but we didnt see her good till she was close  she aim right for us  often they do that and tri to see how close they can come without touch sometim the wheel bite off a sweep and then the pilot stick his head out and laugh and think hes mighti smart  well here she come and we said she was go to tri and shave us but she didnt seem to be sheer off a bit  she was a big one and she was come in a hurri too look like a black cloud with row of glow worm around it but all of a sudden she bulg out big and scari with a long row of wide open furnac door shine like red hot teeth and her monstrous bow and guard hang right over us  there was a yell at us and a jingl of bell to stop the engin a powwow of cuss and whistl of steamand as jim went overboard on one side and i on the other she come smash straight through the raft i divedand i aim to find the bottom too for a thirti foot wheel had got to go over me and i want it to have plenti of room  i could alway stay under water a minut this time i reckon i stay under a minut and a half  then i bounc for the top in a hurri for i was near bust  i pop out to my armpit and blow the water out of my nose and puf a bit  of cours there was a boom current and of cours that boat start her engin again ten second after she stop them for they never care much for raftsmen so now she was churn along up the river out of sight in the thick weather though i could hear her i sung out for jim about a dozen time but i didnt get ani answer so i grab a plank that touch me while i was tread water and struck out for shore shove it ahead of me  but i made out to see that the drift of the current was toward the left hand shore which meant that i was in a cross so i chang off and went that way it was one of these long slant two mile cross so i was a good long time in get over  i made a safe land and clumb up the bank i couldnt see but a littl way but i went poke along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more and then i run across a big old fashion doubl log hous befor i notic it  i was go to rush by and get away but a lot of dog jump out and went to howl and bark at me and i know better than to move anoth peg chapter xvii in about a minut somebodi spoke out of a window without put his head out and say be

name to spellright off without studi i set it down privat becaus somebodi might want me to spell it next and so i want to be handi with it and rattl it off like i was use to it it was a mighti nice famili and a mighti nice hous too  i hadnt seen no hous out in the countri befor that was so nice and had so much style  it didnt have an iron latch on the front door nor a wooden one with a buckskin string but a brass knob to turn the same as hous in town there warnt no bed in the parlor nor a sign of a bed but heap of parlor in town has bed in them  there was a big fireplac that was brick on the bottom and the brick was kept clean and red by pour water on them and scrub them with anoth brick sometim they wash them over with red water paint that they call spanish brown same as they do in town  they had big brass dog iron that could hold up a saw log there was a clock on the middl of the mantelpiec with a pictur of a town paint on the bottom half of the glass front and a round place in the middl of it for the sun and you could see the pendulum swing behind it  it was beauti to hear that clock tick and sometim when one of these peddler had been along and scour her up and got her in good shape she would start in and strike a hundr and fifti befor she got tucker out  they wouldnt took ani money for her well there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock made out of someth like chalk and paint up gaudi  bi one of the parrot was a cat made of crockeri and a crockeri dog by the other and when you press down on them they squeak but didnt open their mouth nor look differ nor interest  they squeak through underneath  there was a coupl of big wild turkey wing fan spread out behind those thing  on the tabl in the middl of the room was a kind of a love crockeri basket that had appl and orang and peach and grape pile up in it which was much redder and yellow and prettier than real one is but they warnt real becaus you could see where piec had got chip off and show the white chalk or whatev it was underneath this tabl had a cover made out of beauti oilcloth with a red and blue spread eagl paint on it and a paint border all around  it come all the way from philadelphia they said  there was some book too pile up perfect exact on each corner of the tabl  one was a big famili bibl full of pictur  one was pilgrim progress about a man that left his famili it didnt say whi  i read consider in it now and then  the statement was interest but tough  anoth was friendship offer full of beauti stuff and poetri but i didnt read the poetri  anoth was henri clay speech and anoth was dr gunn famili medicin which told you all about what to do if a bodi was sick or dead  there was a hymn book and a lot of other book  and there was nice split bottom chair and perfect sound toonot bag down in the middl and bust like an old basket they had pictur hung on the wallsmain washington and lafayett and battl and highland mari and one call sign the declar there was some that they call crayon which one of the daughter which was dead made her own self when she was onli fifteen year old  they was differ from ani pictur i ever see beforeblack most than is common  one was a woman in a slim black dress belt small under the armpit with bulg like a cabbag in the middl of the sleev and a larg black scoop shovel bonnet with a black veil and white slim ankl cross about with black tape and veri wee black slipper like a chisel and she was lean pensiv on a tombston on her right elbow under a weep willow and her other hand hang down her side hold a white handkerchief and a reticul and underneath the pictur it said shall i never see thee more ala  anoth one was a young ladi with her hair all comb up straight to the top of her head and knot there in front of a comb like a chair back and she was cri into a handkerchief and had a dead bird lay on it back in her other hand with it heel up and underneath the pictur it said i shall never hear thi sweet chirrup more ala  there was one where a young ladi was at a window look up at the moon and tear run down her cheek and she had an open letter in one hand with black seal wax show on one edg of it and she was mash a locket with a chain to it against her mouth and underneath the pictur it said and art thou gone yes thou art gone ala  these was all nice pictur i reckon but i didnt somehow seem to take to them becaus if ever i was down a littl they alway give me the fan tod  everybodi was sorri she die becaus she had laid out a lot more of these pictur to do and a bodi could see by what she had done what they had lost  but i reckon that with her disposit she was have a better time in the graveyard  she was at work on what they said was her greatest pictur when she took sick and everi day and everi night it was her prayer to be allow to live till she got it done but she never got the chanc  it was a pictur of a young woman in a long white gown stand on the rail of a bridg all readi to jump off with her hair all down her back and look up to the moon with the tear run down her face and she had two arm fold across her breast and two arm stretch out in front and two more reach up toward the moonand the idea was to see which pair would look best and then scratch out all the other arm but as i was say she die befor she got her mind made up and now they kept this pictur over the head of the bed in her room and everi time her birthday come they hung flower on it  other time it was hid with a littl curtain  the young woman in the pictur had a kind of a nice sweet face but there was so mani arm it made her look too spideri seem to me this young girl kept a scrap book when she was aliv and use to past obituari and accid and case of patient suffer in it out of the presbyterian observ and write poetri after them out of her own head it was veri good poetri this is what she wrote about a boy by the name of stephen dowl bot that fell down a well and was drownd ode to stephen dowl bot decd and did young stephen sicken    and did young stephen die and did the sad heart thicken    and did the mourner cri no such was not the fate of    young stephen dowl bot though sad heart

that head of cur knot nor stomach troubl laid him low    young stephen dowl bot o no then list with tear eye    whilst i his fate do tell his soul did from this cold world fli    bi fall down a well they got him out and empti him    ala it was too late his spirit was gone for to sport aloft    in the realm of the good and great if emmelin grangerford could make poetri like that befor she was fourteen there aint no tell what she could a done by and by  buck said she could rattl off poetri like noth  she didnt ever have to stop to think  he said she would slap down a line and if she couldnt find anyth to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down anoth one and go ahead she warnt particular she could write about anyth you choos to give her to write about just so it was sad everi time a man die or a woman die or a child die she would be on hand with her tribut befor he was cold  she call them tribut the neighbor said it was the doctor first then emmelin then the undertakerth undertak never got in ahead of emmelin but onc and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person name which was whistler  she warnt ever the same after that she never complain but she kinder pine away and did not live long  poor thing mani the time i made myself go up to the littl room that use to be her and get out her poor old scrap book and read in it when her pictur had been aggrav me and i had sour on her a littl  i like all that famili dead one and all and warnt go to let anyth come between us  poor emmelin made poetri about all the dead peopl when she was aliv and it didnt seem right that there warnt nobodi to make some about her now she was gone so i tri to sweat out a vers or two myself but i couldnt seem to make it go somehow  they kept emmelin room trim and nice and all the thing fix in it just the way she like to have them when she was aliv and nobodi ever slept there  the old ladi took care of the room herself though there was plenti of nigger and she sew there a good deal and read her bibl there most well as i was say about the parlor there was beauti curtain on the window  white with pictur paint on them of castl with vine all down the wall and cattl come down to drink  there was a littl old piano too that had tin pan in it i reckon and noth was ever so love as to hear the young ladi sing the last link is broken and play the battl of pragu on it  the wall of all the room was plaster and most had carpet on the floor and the whole hous was whitewash on the outsid it was a doubl hous and the big open place betwixt them was roof and floor and sometim the tabl was set there in the middl of the day and it was a cool comfort place  noth couldnt be better  and warnt the cook good and just bushel of it too chapter xviii col  grangerford was a gentleman you see  he was a gentleman all over and so was his famili  he was well born as the say is and that worth as much in a man as it is in a hors so the widow dougla said and nobodi ever deni that she was of the first aristocraci in our town and pap he alway said it too though he warnt no more qualiti than a mudcat himself  col  grangerford was veri tall and veri slim and had a darkish pali complexion not a sign of red in it anywher he was clean shave everi morn all over his thin face and he had the thinnest kind of lip and the thinnest kind of nostril and a high nose and heavi eyebrow and the blackest kind of eye sunk so deep back that they seem like they was look out of cavern at you as you may say  his forehead was high and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulder his hand was long and thin and everi day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eye to look at it and on sunday he wore a blue tail coat with brass button on it  he carri a mahogani cane with a silver head to it  there warnt no frivolish about him not a bit and he warnt ever loud  he was as kind as he could beyou could feel that you know and so you had confid  sometim he smile and it was good to see but when he straighten himself up like a liberti pole and the lightn begun to flicker out from under his eyebrow you want to climb a tree first and find out what the matter was afterward  he didnt ever have to tell anybodi to mind their mannerseverybodi was alway good manner where he was  everybodi love to have him around too he was sunshin most alwaysi mean he made it seem like good weather  when he turn into a cloudbank it was aw dark for half a minut and that was enough there wouldnt noth go wrong again for a week when him and the old ladi come down in the morn all the famili got up out of their chair and give them good day and didnt set down again till they had set down  then tom and bob went to the sideboard where the decant was and mix a glass of bitter and hand it to him and he held it in his hand and wait till tom and bob was mix and then they bow and said our duti to you sir and madam and they bow the least bit in the world and said thank you and so they drank all three and bob and tom pour a spoon of water on the sugar and the mite of whiski or appl brandi in the bottom of their tumbler and give it to me and buck and we drank to the old peopl too bob was the oldest and tom nexttal beauti men with veri broad shoulder and brown face and long black hair and black eye  they dress in white linen from head to foot like the old gentleman and wore broad panama hat then there was miss charlott she was twenti five and tall and proud and grand but as good as she could be when she warnt stir up but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your track like her father  she was beauti so was her sister miss sophia but it was a differ kind  she was gentl and sweet like a dove and she was onli twenti each person had their own nigger to wait on thembuck too  mi nigger had a monstrous easi time becaus i warnt use to have anybodi do anyth for me but buck was on the jump most of the time this was all there was of the famili now but there use to be morethre son they got kill and emmelin that die the old gentleman own a lot of farm and over a hundr nigger sometim a stack of peopl would come there horseback from ten or fifteen mile around and stay five or six day and have such junket round about and on the river and danc and picnic in the wood daytim and ball at the hous night  these peopl was most kinfolk of the famili  the men brought their gun with them  it was a handsom lot of qualiti i tell you there was anoth clan of aristocraci around theref or six familiesmost of the name of shepherdson  they was as high tone and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of grangerford  the shepherdson and grangerford use the same steamboat land which was about two mile abov our hous so sometim when i went up there with a lot of our folk i use to see a lot of the shepherdson there on their fine hors one day buck and me was away out in the wood hunt and heard a hors come  we was cross the road  buck say quick  jump for the wood we done it and then peep down the wood through the leav  pretti soon a splendid young man come gallop down the road set his hors easi and look like a soldier  he had his gun across his pommel  i had seen him befor  it was young harney shepherdson  i heard buck gun go off at my ear and harney hat tumbl off from his head  he grab his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid  but we didnt wait  we start through the wood on a run  the wood warnt thick so i look over my shoulder to dodg the bullet and twice i seen harney cover buck with his gun and then he rode away the way he cometo get his hat i reckon but i couldnt see  we never stop run till we got home  the old gentleman eye blaze a minutetwa pleasur main i judgedthen his face sort of smooth down and he say kind of gentl i dont like that shoot from behind a bush  whi didnt you step into the road my boy the shepherdson dont father  they alway take advantag miss charlott she held her head up like a queen while buck was tell his tale and her nostril spread and her eye snap  the two young men look dark but never said noth  miss sophia she turn pale but the color come back when she found the man warnt hurt soon as i could get buck down by the corn crib under the tree by ourselv i say did you want to kill him buck well i bet i did what did he do to you him  he never done noth to me well then what did you want to kill him for whi nothingon it on account of the feud what a feud whi where was you rais  dont you know what a feud is never heard of it beforetel me about it well say buck a feud is this way  a man has a quarrel with anoth man and kill him then that other man brother kill him then the other brother on both side goe for one anoth then the cousin chip inand by and by everybodi kill off and there aint no more feud  but it kind of slow and take a long time has this one been go on long buck well i should reckon  it start thirti year ago or somer along there  there was troubl bout someth and then a lawsuit to settl it and the suit went agin one of the men and so he up and shot the man that won the suitwhich he would natur do of cours  anybodi would what was the troubl about buckland i reckon maybei dont know well who done the shoot  was it a grangerford or a shepherdson law how do i know  it was so long ago dont anybodi know oh yes pa know i reckon and some of the other old peopl but they dont know now what the row was about in the first place has there been mani kill buck yes right smart chanc of funer  but they dont alway kill  pas got a few buckshot in him but he dont mind it cuz he dont weigh much anyway  bob been carv up some with a bowi and tom been hurt onc or twice has anybodi been kill this year buck yes we got one and they got one  bout three month ago my cousin bud fourteen year old was ride through the wood on tother side of the river and didnt have no weapon with him which was blame foolish and in a lonesom place he hear a hors a come behind him and see old baldi shepherdson a linkin after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair a fli in the wind and stead of jump off and take to the brush bud low he could out run him so they had it nip and tuck for five mile or more the old man a gain all the time so at last bud seen it warnt ani use so he stop and face around so as to have the bullet hole in front you know and the old man he rode up and shot him down  but he didnt git much chanc to enjoy his luck for insid of a week our folk laid him out i reckon that old man was a coward buck i reckon he warnt a coward  not by a blame sight  there aint a coward amongst them shepherdsonsnot a one  and there aint no coward amongst the grangerford either  whi that old man kep up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three grangerford and come out winner  they was all a horseback he lit off of his hors and got behind a littl woodpil and kep his hors befor him to stop the bullet but the grangerford stay on their hors and caper around the old man and pepper away at him and he pepper away at them  him and his hors both went home pretti leaki and crippl but the grangerford had to be fetch homeand one of em was dead and anoth die the next day  no sir if a bodi out hunt for coward he dont want to fool away ani time amongst them shepherdson becuz they dont breed ani of that kind next sunday we all went to church about three mile everybodi a horseback the men took their gun along so did buck and kept them between their knee or stood them handi against the wall  the shepherdson done the same  it was pretti orneri preachingal about brother love and such like tiresom but everybodi said it was a good sermon and they all talk it over go home and had such a power lot to say about faith and good work and free grace and preforeordestin and i dont know what all that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest sunday i had run across yet about an hour after dinner everybodi was doze around some in their chair and some in their room and it got to be pretti dull  buck and a dog was stretch out on the grass in the sun sound asleep  i went up to our room and judg i would take a nap myself  i found that sweet miss sophia stand in her door which was next to our and she took me in her room and shut the door veri soft and ask me if i like her and i said i did and she ask me if i would do someth for her and not tell anybodi and i said i would  then she said shed forgot her testament and left it in the seat at church between two other book and would i slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her and not say noth to nobodi  i said i would so i slid out and slip off up the road and there warnt anybodi at the church except mayb a hog or two for there warnt ani lock on the door and hog like a puncheon floor in summer time becaus it cool  if you notic most folk dont go to church onli when theyv got to but a hog is differ say i to myself someth up it aint natur for a girl to be in such a sweat about a testament  so i give it a shake and out drop a littl piec of paper with half past two wrote on it with a pencil  i ransack it but couldnt find anyth els  i couldnt make anyth out of that so i put the paper in the book again and when i got home and upstair there was miss sophia in her door wait for me  she pull me in and shut the door then she look in the testament till she found the paper and as soon as she read it she look glad and befor a bodi could think she grab me and give me a squeez and said i was the best boy in the world and not to tell anybodi  she was mighti red in the face for a minut and her eye light up and it made her power pretti  i was a good deal astonish but when i got my breath i ask her what the paper was about and she ask me if i had read it and i said no and she ask me if i could read write and i told her no onli coars hand and then she said the paper warnt anyth but a book mark to keep her

land i work along under the tree and brush till i got to a good place and then i clumb up into the fork of a cottonwood that was out of reach and watch  there was a wood rank four foot high a littl way in front of the tree and first i was go to hide behind that but mayb it was luckier i didnt there was four or five men cavort around on their hors in the open place befor the log store cuss and yell and tri to get at a coupl of young chap that was behind the wood rank alongsid of the steamboat land but they couldnt come it  everi time one of them show himself on the river side of the woodpil he got shot at  the two boy was squat back to back behind the pile so they could watch both way by and by the men stop cavort around and yell  they start ride toward the store then up get one of the boy draw a steadi bead over the wood rank and drop one of them out of his saddl  all the men jump off of their hors and grab the hurt one and start to carri him to the store and that minut the two boy start on the run  they got half way to the tree i was in befor the men notic then the men see them and jump on their hors and took out after them  they gain on the boy but it didnt do no good the boy had too good a start they got to the woodpil that was in front of my tree and slip in behind it and so they had the bulg on the men again one of the boy was buck and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen year old the men rip around awhil and then rode away  as soon as they was out of sight i sung out to buck and told him  he didnt know what to make of my voic come out of the tree at first  he was aw surpris  he told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again said they was up to some devil or otherwouldnt be gone long  i wish i was out of that tree but i dasnt come down  buck begun to cri and rip and low that him and his cousin joe that was the other young chap would make up for this day yet  he said his father and his two brother was kill and two or three of the enemi  said the shepherdson laid for them in ambush  buck said his father and brother ought to wait for their relationsth shepherdson was too strong for them  i ask him what was becom of young harney and miss sophia  he said theyd got across the river and was safe  i was glad of that but the way buck did take on becaus he didnt manag to kill harney that day he shot at himi haint ever heard anyth like it all of a sudden bang bang bang goe three or four gunsth men had slip around through the wood and come in from behind without their hors  the boy jump for the riverboth of them hurtand as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shoot at them and sing out kill them kill them  it made me so sick i most fell out of the tree  i aint a go to tell all that happenedit would make me sick again if i was to do that  i wish i hadnt ever come ashor that night to see such thing  i aint ever go to get shut of themlot of time i dream about them i stay in the tree till it begun to get dark afraid to come down sometim i heard gun away off in the wood and twice i seen littl gang of men gallop past the log store with gun so i reckon the troubl was still a go on  i was mighti downheart so i made up my mind i wouldnt ever go anear that hous again becaus i reckon i was to blame somehow i judg that that piec of paper meant that miss sophia was to meet harney somewher at half past two and run off and i judg i ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she act and then mayb he would a lock her up and this aw mess wouldnt ever happen when i got down out of the tree i crept along down the river bank a piec and found the two bodi lay in the edg of the water and tug at them till i got them ashor then i cover up their face and got away as quick as i could  i cri a littl when i was cover up buck face for he was mighti good to me it was just dark now  i never went near the hous but struck through the wood and made for the swamp  jim warnt on his island so i tramp off in a hurri for the crick and crowd through the willow red hot to jump aboard and get out of that aw countri  the raft was gone  mi soul but i was scare  i couldnt get my breath for most a minut then i rais a yell  a voic not twenti five foot from me say good lan is dat you honey  doan make no nois it was jim voicenoth ever sound so good befor  i run along the bank a piec and got aboard and jim he grab me and hug me he was so glad to see me  he say law bless you chile i uz right down sho yous dead agin  jack been heah he say he reckn yous ben shot kase you didn come home no mo so is jes dis minut a startin de raf down toward de mouf er de crick sos to be all readi for to shove out en leav soon as jack come agin en tell me for certain you is dead  lawsi is mighti glad to git you back again honey i say all rightthat mighti good they wont find me and theyll think ive been kill and float down the riverther someth up there that ll help them think soso dont you lose no time jim but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can i never felt easi till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middl of the mississippi  then we hung up our signal lantern and judg that we was free and safe onc more  i hadnt had a bite to eat sinc yesterday so jim he got out some corn dodger and buttermilk and pork and cabbag and greensther aint noth in the world so good when it cook rightand whilst i eat my supper we talk and had a good time  i was power glad to get away from the feud and so was jim to get away from the swamp  we said there warnt no home like a raft after all  other place do seem so cramp up and smotheri but a raft dont  you feel mighti free and easi and comfort on a raft chapter xix two or three day and night went by i reckon i might say they swum by they slid along so quiet and smooth and love  here is the way we put in the time  it was a monstrous big river down theresometim a mile and a half wide we run night and laid up and hid daytim soon as night was most gone we stop navig and tie upnear alway in the dead water under a towhead and then cut young cottonwood and willow and hid the raft with them  then we set out the line  next we slid into the river and had a swim so as to freshen up and cool off then we set down on the sandi bottom where the water was about knee deep and watch the daylight come  not a sound anywheresperfect stilljust like the whole world was asleep onli sometim the bullfrog a clutter mayb  the first thing to see look away over the water was a kind of dull linethat was the wood on tother side you couldnt make noth els out then a pale place in the sky then more pale spread around then the river soften up away off and warnt black ani more but gray you could see littl dark spot drift along ever so far awaytrad scow and such thing and long black streaksraft sometim you could hear a sweep screak or jumbl up voic it was so still and sound come so far and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there a snag there in a swift current which break on it and make that streak look that way and you see the mist curl up off of the water and the east redden up and the river and you make out a log cabin in the edg of the wood away on the bank on tother side of the river be a woodyard like and pile by them cheat so you can throw a dog through it anywher then the nice breez spring up and come fan you from over there so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the wood and the flower but sometim not that way becaus theyv left dead fish lay around gar and such and they do get pretti rank and next youv got the full day and everyth smile in the sun and the song bird just go it a littl smoke couldnt be notic now so we would take some fish off of the line and cook up a hot breakfast  and afterward we would watch the lonesom of the river and kind of lazi along and by and by lazi off to sleep  wake up by and by and look to see what done it and mayb see a steamboat cough along up stream so far off toward the other side you couldnt tell noth about her onli whether she was a stern wheel or side wheel then for about an hour there wouldnt be noth to hear nor noth to seejust solid lonesom  next youd see a raft slide by away off yonder and mayb a galoot on it chop becaus theyr most alway do it on a raft youd see the axe flash and come downyou dont hear noth you see that axe go up again and by the time it abov the man head then you hear the kchunk it had took all that time to come over the water  so we would put in the day lazi around listen to the still  onc there was a thick fog and the raft and thing that went by was beat tin pan so the steamboat wouldnt run over them  a scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talk and cuss and laughingheard them plain but we couldnt see no sign of them it made you feel crawli it was like spirit carri on that way in the air  jim said he believ it was spirit but i say no spirit wouldnt say dern the dern fog soon as it was night out we shove when we got her out to about the middl we let her alon and let her float wherev the current want her to then we lit the pipe and dangl our leg in the water and talk about all kind of thingsw was alway nake day and night whenev the mosquito would let usth new cloth buck folk made for me was too good to be comfort and besid i didnt go much on cloth nohow sometim wed have that whole river all to ourselv for the longest time yonder was the bank and the island across the water and mayb a sparkwhich was a candl in a cabin window and sometim on the water you could see a spark or twoon a raft or a scow you know and mayb you could hear a fiddl or a song come over from one of them craft it love to live on a raft  we had the sky up there all speckl with star and we use to lay on our back and look up at them and discuss about whether they was made or onli just happen  jim he allow they was made but i allow they happen i judg it would have took too long to make so mani  jim said the moon could a laid them well that look kind of reason so i didnt say noth against it becaus ive seen a frog lay most as mani so of cours it could be done we use to watch the star that fell too and see them streak down  jim allow theyd got spoil and was hove out of the nest onc or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slip along in the dark and now and then she would belch a whole world of spark up out of her chimbley and they would rain down in the river and look aw pretti then she would turn a corner and her light would wink out and her powwow shut off and leav the river still again and by and by her wave would get to us a long time after she was gone and joggl the raft a bit and after that you wouldnt hear noth for you couldnt tell how long except mayb frog or someth after midnight the peopl on shore went to bed and then for two or three hour the shore was blackno more spark in the cabin window  these spark was our clockth first one that show again meant morn was come so we hunt a place to hide and tie up right away one morn about daybreak i found a cano and cross over a chute to the main shoreit was onli two hundr yardsand paddl about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress wood to see if i couldnt get some berri just as i was pass a place where a kind of a cowpath cross the crick here come a coupl of men tear up the path as tight as they could foot it  i thought i was a goner for whenev anybodi was after anybodi i judg it was me or mayb jim  i was about to dig out from there in a hurri but they was pretti close to me then and sung out and beg me to save their livessaid they hadnt been do noth and was be chase for itsaid there was men and dog a come  they want to jump right in but i say dont you do it  i dont hear the dog and hors yet youv got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a littl way then you take to the water and wade down to me and get inthatl throw the dog off the scent they done it and soon as they was aboard i lit out for our towhead and in about five or ten minut we heard the dog and the men away off shout we heard them come along toward the crick but couldnt see them they seem to stop and fool around a while then as we got further and further away all the time we couldnt hard hear them at all by the time we had left a mile of wood behind us and struck the river everyth was quiet and we paddl over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwood and was safe one of these fellow was about seventi or upward and had a bald head and veri gray

got away as soon as it was good and dark  the king told us to stand well out toward the middl of the river and not show a light till we got a long way below the town  we come in sight of the littl bunch of light by and bythat was the town you knowand slid by about a half a mile out all right  when we was three quarter of a mile below we hoist up our signal lantern and about ten oclock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everyth so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better then him and the duke crawl into the wigwam and turn in for the night  it was my watch below till twelv but i wouldnt a turn in anyway if id had a bed becaus a bodi dont see such a storm as that everi day in the week not by a long sight  mi soul how the wind did scream along  and everi second or two there come a glare that lit up the white cap for a half a mile around and youd see the island look dusti through the rain and the tree thrash around in the wind then come a h whackbum bum bumbl umbl um bum bum bum bumand the thunder would go rumbl and grumbl away and quitand then rip come anoth flash and anoth sockdolag  the wave most wash me off the raft sometim but i hadnt ani cloth on and didnt mind  we didnt have no troubl about snag the lightn was glare and flitter around so constant that we could see them plenti soon enough to throw her head this way or

along come a regular ripper and wash me overboard  it most kill jim a laugh  he was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was anyway i took the watch and jim he laid down and snore away and by and by the storm let up for good and all and the first cabin light that show i roust him out and we slid the raft into hide quarter for the day the king got out an old ratti deck of card after breakfast and him and the duke play seven up a while five cent a game  then they got tire of it and allow they would lay out a campaign as they call it the duke went down into his carpet bag and fetch up a lot of

chap and a long white cotton nightshirt and a ruffl nightcap to match  the king was satisfi so the duke got out his book and read the part over in the most splendid spread eagl way pranc around and act at the same time to show how it had got to be done then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart there was a littl one hors town about three mile down the bend and after dinner the duke said he had cipher out his idea about how to run in daylight without it be dangersom for jim so he allow he would go down to the town and fix that thing  the king allow he would go too

carpent shopcarpent and printer all gone to the meet and no door lock  it was a dirti litter up place and had ink mark and handbil with pictur of hors and runaway nigger on them all over the wall  the duke shed his coat and said he was all right now  so me and the king lit out for the camp meet we got there in about a half an hour fair drip for it was a most aw hot day  there was as much as a thousand peopl there from twenti mile around  the wood was full of team and wagon hitch everywher feed out of the wagon trough and stomp to keep off the fli  there was shed made out of pole and roof over with branch where they had lemonad and gingerbread to sell and pile of watermelon and green corn and such like truck the preach was go on under the same kind of shed onli they was bigger and held crowd of peopl  the bench was made out of outsid slab of log with hole bore in the round side to drive stick into for leg they didnt have no back  the preacher had high platform to stand on at one end of the shed  the women had on sun bonnet and some had linsey woolsey frock some gingham one and a few of the young one had on calico  some of the young men was barefoot and some of the children didnt have on ani cloth but just a tow linen shirt  some of the old women was knit and some of the young folk was court on the sli the first shed we come to the preacher was line out a hymn  he line out two line everybodi sung it and it was kind of grand to hear it there was so mani of them and they done it in such a rous way then he line out two more for them to singand so on  the peopl woke up more and more and sung louder and louder and toward the end some begun to groan and some begun to shout  then the preacher begun to preach and begun in earnest too and went weav first to one side of the platform and then the other and then a lean down over the front of it with his arm and his bodi go all the time and shout his word out with all his might and everi now and then he would hold up his bibl and spread it open and kind of pass it around this way and that shout it the brazen serpent in the wilder  look upon it and live  and peopl would shout out glorya a men  and so he went on and the peopl groan and cri and say amen oh come to the mourner bench come black with sin amen come sick and sore amen come lame and halt and blind amen come pore and needi sunk in shame a a men come all that worn and soil and sufferingcom with a broken spirit come with a contrit heart come in your rag and sin and dirt the water that cleans is free the door of heaven stand openoh enter in and be at rest a a men   glori glori hallelujah and so on  you couldnt make out what the preacher said ani more on account of the shout and cri  folk got up everywher in the crowd and work their way just by main strength to the mourner bench with the tear run down their face and when all the mourner had got up there to the front bench in a crowd they sung and shout and flung themselv down on the straw just crazi and wild well the first i know the king got a go and you could hear him over everybodi and next he went a charg up on to the platform and the preacher he beg him to speak to the peopl and he done it  he told them he was a piratebeen a pirat for thirti year out in the indian oceanand his crew was thin out consider last spring in a fight and he was home now to take out some fresh men and thank to good hed been rob last night and put ashor off of a steamboat without a cent and he was glad of it it was the blessedest thing that ever happen to him becaus he was a chang man now and happi for the first time in his life and poor as he was he was go to start right off and work his way back to the indian ocean and put in the rest of his life tri to turn the pirat into the true path for he could do it better than anybodi els be acquaint with all pirat crew in that ocean and though it would take him a long time to get there without money he would get there anyway and everi time he convinc a pirat he would say to him dont you thank me dont you give me no credit it all belong to them dear peopl in pokevill camp meet natur brother and benefactor of the race and that dear preacher there the truest friend a pirat ever had and then he bust into tear and so did everybodi  then somebodi sing out take up a collect for him take up a collect  well a half a dozen made a jump to do it but somebodi sing out let him pass the hat around  then everybodi said it the preacher too so the king went all through the crowd with his hat swab his eye and bless the peopl and prais them and thank them for be so good to the poor pirat away off there and everi littl while the prettiest kind of girl with the tear run down their cheek would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to rememb

honor but he said as this was the last day of the camp meet he couldnt do no good and besid he was in a sweat to get to the indian ocean right off and go to work on the pirat when we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collect eighti seven dollar and seventi five cent  and then he had fetch away a three gallon jug of whiski too that he found under a wagon when he was start home through the wood  the king said take it all around it laid over ani day hed ever put in in the missionari line  he said it warnt no use talk heathen dont amount to shuck alongsid of pirat

breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft and pull off his boot and roll up his britch and let his leg dangl in the water so as to be comfort and lit his pipe and went to get his romeo and juliet by heart  when he had got it pretti good him and the duke begun to practic it togeth  the duke had to learn him over and over again how to say everi speech and he made him sigh and put his hand on his heart and after a while he said he done it pretti well onli he say you mustnt bellow out romeo that way like a bullyou must say it soft and sick and languishi sor o o meo that is

the still was aw creepi and uncomfort  sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd and wherev it struck the peopl tri a littl to out gaze him but they couldnt they drop their eye and look sneaki then pretti soon sherburn sort of laugh not the pleasant kind but the kind that make you feel like when you are eat bread that got sand in it then he say slow and scorn the idea of you lynch anybodi  it amus  the idea of you think you had pluck enough to lynch a man  becaus your brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast out women that come along here did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hand on a man  whi a man safe in the hand of ten thousand of your kinda long as it daytim and your not behind him do i know you  i know you clear through i was born and rais in the south and ive live in the north so i know the averag all around the averag man a coward  in the north he let anybodi walk over him that want to and goe home and pray for a humbl spirit to bear it in the south one man all by himself has stop a stage full of men in the daytim and rob the lot  your newspap call you a brave peopl so much that you think you are braver than ani other peoplewherea your just as brave and no braver  whi dont your juri hang murder  becaus theyr afraid the man friend will shoot them in the back in the darkand it just what they would do so they alway acquit and then a man goe in the night with a hundr mask coward at his back and lynch the rascal  your mistak is that you didnt bring a man with you that one mistak and the other is that you didnt come in the dark and fetch your mask  you brought part of a manbuck hark thereand if you hadnt had him to start you youd a taken it out in blow you didnt want to come  the averag man dont like troubl and danger you dont

them but with courag that borrow from their mass and from their offic  but a mob without ani man at the head of it is beneath piti  now the thing for you to do is to droop your tail and go home and crawl in a hole  if ani real lynch go to be done it will be done in the dark southern fashion and when they come theyll bring their mask and fetch a man along  now leav and take your half a man with youtoss his gun up across his left arm and cock it when he say this the crowd wash back sudden and then broke all apart and went tear off everi which way and buck hark he heel it after them look toler cheap  i could a stay if i want to but i didnt want to i went to the circus and loaf around the back side till the watchman went by and then dive in under the tent  i had my twenti dollar gold piec and some other money but i reckon i better save it becaus there aint no tell how soon you are go to need it away from home and amongst stranger that way  you cant be too care  i aint oppos to spend money on circus when there aint no other way but there aint no use in wast it on them it was a real bulli circus  it was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come ride in two and two a gentleman and ladi side by side the men just in their drawer and undershirt and no shoe nor stirrup and rest their hand on their thigh easi and comfortablether must a been twenti of themand everi ladi with a love complexion and perfect beauti and look just like a gang of real sure enough queen and dress in cloth that cost million of dollar and just litter with diamond  it was a power fine sight i never see anyth so love  and then one by one they got up and stood and went a weav around the ring so gentl and wavi and grace the men look ever so tall and airi and straight with their head bob and skim along away up there under the tent roof and everi ladi rose leafi dress flap soft and silki around her hip and she look like the most loveliest parasol and then faster and faster they went all of them danc first one foot out in the air and then the other the hors lean more and more and the ringmast go round and round the center pole crack his whip and shout hihi and the clown crack joke behind him and by and by all hand drop the rein and everi ladi put her knuckl on her hip and everi gentleman fold his arm and then how the hors did lean over and hump themselv  and so one after the other they all skip off into the ring and made the sweetest bow i ever see and then scamper out and everybodi clap their hand and went just about wild well all through the circus they done the most astonish thing and all the time that clown carri on so it most kill the peopl  the ringmast couldnt ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest thing a bodi ever said and how he ever could think of so mani of them and so sudden and so pat was what i couldnt noway understand whi i couldnt a thought of them in a year and by and by a drunk man tri to get into the ringsaid he want to ride said he could ride as well as anybodi that ever was  they argu and tri to keep him out but he wouldnt listen and the whole show come to a standstil  then the peopl begun to holler at him and make fun of him and that made him mad and he begun to rip and tear so that stir up the peopl and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the bench and swarm toward the ring say knock him down throw him out and one or two women begun to scream  so then the ringmast he made a littl speech and said he hope there wouldnt be no disturb and if the man would promis he wouldnt make no more troubl he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the hors  so everybodi laugh and said all right and the man got on the minut he was on the hors begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around with two circus men hang on to his bridl tri to hold him and the drunk man hang on to his neck and his heel fli in the air everi jump and the whole crowd of peopl stand up shout and laugh till tear roll down  and at last sure enough all the circus men could do the hors broke loos and away he went like the veri nation round and round the ring with that sot lay down on him and hang to his neck with first one leg hang most to the ground on one side and then tother one on tother side and the peopl just crazi  it warnt funni to me though i was all of a trembl to see his danger  but pretti soon he struggl up astraddl and grab the bridl a reel this way and that and the next minut he sprung up and drop the bridl and stood and the hors a go like a hous afir too  he just stood up there a sail around as easi and comfort as if he warnt ever drunk in his lifeand then he begun to pull off his cloth and sling them  he shed them so thick they kind of clog up the air and altogeth he shed seventeen suit and then there he was slim and handsom and dress the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw and he lit into that hors with his whip and made him fair humand final skip off and made his bow and danc off to the dress room and everybodi just a howl with pleasur and astonish then the ringmast he see how he had been fool and he was the sickest ringmast you ever see i reckon  whi it was one of his own men  he had got up that joke all out of his own head and never let on to nobodi well i felt sheepish enough to be took in so but i wouldnt a been in that ringmast place not for a thousand dollar  i dont know there may be bullier circus than what that one was but i never struck them yet anyway it was plenti good enough for me and wherev i run across it it can have all of my custom everi time well that night we had our show but there warnt onli about twelv peopl therejust enough to pay expens  and they laugh all the time and that made the duke mad and everybodi left anyway befor the show was over but one boy which was asleep  so the duke said these arkansaw lunkhead couldnt come up to shakespear what they want was low comedyand mayb someth ruther wors than low comedi he reckon  he said he could size their style  so next morn he got some big sheet of wrap paper and some black paint and draw off some handbil and stuck them up all over the villag  the bill said chapter xxiii well all day him and the king was hard at it rig up a stage and a curtain and a row of candl for footlight and that night the hous was jam full of men in no time  when the place couldnt hold no more the duke he quit tend door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up befor the curtain and made a littl speech and prais up this tragedi and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was and so he went on a brag about the tragedi and about edmund kean the elder which was to play the main princip part in it and at last when hed got everybodi expect up high enough he roll up the curtain and the next minut the king come a pranc out on all four nake and he was paint all over ring streak and stripe all sort of color as splendid as a rainbow  andbut never mind the rest of his outfit it was just wild but it was aw funni the peopl most kill themselv laugh and when the king got done caper and caper off behind the scene they roar and clap and storm and haw haw till he come back and done it over again and after that they made him do it anoth time well it would make a cow laugh to see the shine that old idiot cut then the duke he let the curtain down and bow to the peopl and say the great tragedi will be perform onli two night more on account of press london engag where the seat is all sold alreadi for it in druri lane and then he make them anoth bow and say if he has succeed in pleas them and instruct them he will be deepli obleeg if they will mention it to their friend and get them to come and see it twenti peopl sing out what is it over  is that all

the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for work them town  jim he spoke to the duke and said he hope it wouldnt take but a few hour becaus it got mighti heavi and tiresom to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tie with the rope  you see when we left him all alon we had to tie him becaus if anybodi happen on to him all by himself and not tie it wouldnt look much like he was a runaway nigger you know so the duke said it was kind of hard to have to lay rope all day and hed cipher out some way to get around it he was uncommon bright the duke was and he soon struck it  he dress jim up in king lear outfitit was a long curtain calico gown and a white hors hair wig and whisker and then he took his theater paint and paint jim face and hand and ear and neck all over a dead dull solid blue like a man that been drownd nine day  blame if he warnt the horriblest look outrag i ever see  then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingl so sick arabbut harmless when not out of his head and he nail that shingl to a lath and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam  jim was satisfi  he said it was a sight better than lie tie a coupl of year everi day and trembl all over everi time there was a sound  the duke told him to make himself free and easi and if anybodi ever come meddl around he must hop out of the wigwam and carri on a littl and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast and he reckon they would light out and leav him alon  which was sound enough judgment but you take the averag man and he wouldnt wait for him to howl  whi he didnt onli look

struck anyth like it im a nigger it was enough to make a bodi asham of the human race chapter xxv the news was all over town in two minut and you could see the peopl tear down on the run from everi which way some of them put on their coat as they come  pretti soon we was in the middl of a crowd and the nois of the tramp was like a soldier march  the window and dooryard was full and everi minut somebodi would say over a fenc is it them and somebodi trot along with the gang would answer back and say you bet it is when we got to the hous the street in front of it was pack and the three girl

and tother hand to their eye walk slow and solemn over there everybodi drop back to give them room and all the talk and nois stop peopl say sh and all the men take their hat off and droop their head so you could a heard a pin fall  and when they got there they bent over and look in the coffin and took one sight and then they bust out a cri so you could a heard them to orlean most and then they put their arm around each other neck and hung their chin over each other shoulder and then for three minut or mayb four i never see two men leak the way they done  and mind you everybodi was do the same and the place was that damp i never see anyth like it then one of them got on one side of the coffin and tother on tother side and they kneel down and rest their forehead on the coffin and let on

they all jest laid theirselv out to make me feel at home and know i was amongst friend  i felt so orneri and low down and mean that i say to myself my mind made up ill hive that money for them or bust so then i lit outfor bed i said mean some time or anoth  when i got by myself i went to think the thing over  i say to myself shall i go to that doctor privat and blow on these fraud  nothat wont do he might tell who told him then the king and the duke would make it warm for me  shall i go privat and tell mari jane  noi dasnt do it her face would give them a hint sure theyv got the money and theyd slide right out and get away with it  if she was to fetch in help id get mix up in the busi befor it was done with i judg  no there aint no good way but one  i got to steal that money somehow and i got to steal it some way that they wont suspicion that i done it theyv got a good thing here and they aint a go to leav till theyv play this famili and this town for all theyr worth so ill find a chanc time enough ill steal it and hide it and by and by when im away down the river ill write a letter and tell mari jane where it hid  but i better hive it tonight if i can becaus the doctor mayb hasnt let up as much as he let on he has he might scare them out of here yet so think i ill go and search them room  upstair the hall was dark but i found the duke room and start to paw around it with my hand but i recollect it wouldnt be much like the king to let anybodi els take care of that money but his own self so then i went to his room and begun to paw around there  but i see i couldnt do noth without a candl and i dasnt light one of cours  so i judg id got to do the other thinglay for them and eavesdrop  about that time i hear their footstep come and was go to skip under the bed i reach for it but it wasnt where i thought it would be but i touch the curtain that hid mari jane frock so i jump in behind that and snuggl in amongst the gown and stood there perfect still they come in and shut the door and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed  then i was glad i hadnt found the bed when i want it  and yet you know it kind of natur to hide under the bed when you are up to anyth privat  they set down then and the king say well what is it  and cut it middlin short becaus it better for us to be down there a whoopin up the mournin than up here givin em a chanc to talk us over well this is it capet  i aint easi i aint comfort  that doctor lay on my mind  i want to know your plan  ive got a notion and i think it a sound one what is it duke that we better glide out of this befor three in the morn and clip it down the river with what weve got  special see we got it so easi given back to us flung at our head as you may say when of cours we allow to have to steal it back  im for knock off and light out that made me feel pretti bad  about an hour or two ago it would a been a littl differ but now it made me feel bad and disappoint the king rip out and say what  and not sell out the rest o the properti  march off like a passel of fool and leav eight or nine thousn dollar worth o properti layin around jest sufferin to be scoop inand all good salabl stuff too the duke he grumbl said the bag of gold was enough and he didnt want to go no deeperdidnt want to rob a lot of orphan of everyth they had whi how you talk say the king  we shant rob em of noth at all but jest this money  the peopl that buy the properti is the suffrer becaus as soon s it found out at we didnt own itwhich wont be long after weve slidth sale wont be valid and it ll all go back to the estat  these yer orphan ll git their hous back agin and that enough for them theyr young and spri and kn easi earn a livin   they aint a goin to suffer  whi jest thinkther thousn and thousn that aint nigh so well off  bless you they aint got nothn to complain of well the king he talk him blind so at last he give in and said all right but said he believ it was blame foolish to stay and that doctor hang over them  but the king say cuss the doctor  what do we kyer for him  haint we got all the fool in town on our side  and aint that a big enough major in ani town so they got readi to go down stair again  the duke say i dont think we put that money in a good place that cheer me up  id begun to think i warnt go to get a hint of no kind to help me  the king say whi becaus mari jane ll be in mourn from this out and first you know the nigger that doe up the room will get an order to box these dud up and put em away and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it your head level agin duke say the king and he come a fumbl under the curtain two or three foot from where i was  i stuck tight to the wall and kept mighti still though quiveri and i wonder what them fellow would say to me if they catch me and i tri to think what id better do if they did catch me  but the king he got the bag befor i could think more than about a half a thought and he never suspicion i was around  they took and shove the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather bed and cram it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now becaus a nigger onli make up the feather bed and dont turn over the straw tick onli about twice a year and so it warnt in no danger of get stole now but i know better  i had it out of there befor they was half way down stair  i grope along up to my cubbi and hid it there till i could get a chanc to do better  i judg i better hide it outsid of the hous somewher becaus if they miss it they would give the hous a good ransack  i know that veri well  then i turn in with my cloth all on but i couldnt a gone to sleep if id a want to i was in such a sweat to get through with the busi  bi and by i heard the king and the duke come up so i roll off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder and wait to see if anyth was go to happen  but noth did so i held on till all the late sound had quit and the earli one hadnt begun yet and then i slip down the ladder chapter xxvii i crept to their door and listen they was snore  so i tipto along and got down stair all right  there warnt a sound anywher  i peep through a crack of the dine room door and see the men that was watch the corps all sound asleep on their chair  the door was open into the parlor where the corps was lay and there was a candl in both room i pass along and the parlor door was open but i see there warnt nobodi in there but the remaind of peter so i shove on by but the front door was lock and the key wasnt there  just then i heard somebodi come down the stair back behind me  i run in the parlor and took a swift look around and the onli place i see to hide the bag was in the coffin  the lid was shove along about a foot show the dead man face down in there with a wet cloth over it and his shroud on  i tuck the money bag in under the lid just down beyond where his hand was cross which made me creep they was so cold and then i run back across the room and in behind the door the person come was mari jane  she went to the coffin veri soft and kneel down and look in then she put up her handkerchief and i see she begun to cri though i couldnt hear her and her back was to me  i slid out and as i pass the dine room i thought id make sure them watcher hadnt seen me so i look through the crack and everyth was all right  they hadnt stir i slip up to bed feel ruther blue on account of the thing play out that way after i had took so much troubl and run so much resk about it  say i if it could stay where it is all right becaus when we get down the river a hundr mile or two i could write back to mari jane and she could dig him up again and get it but that aint the thing that go to happen the thing that go to happen is the money ll be found when they come to screw on the lid  then the king ll get it again and it ll be a long day befor he give anybodi anoth chanc to smouch it from him of cours i want to slide down and get it out of there but i dasnt tri it  everi minut it was get earlier now and pretti soon some of them watcher would begin to stir and i might get catchedcatch with six thousand dollar in my hand that nobodi hadnt hire me to take care of  i dont wish to be mix up in no such busi as that i say to myself when i got down stair in the morn the parlor was shut up and the watcher was gone  there warnt nobodi around but the famili and the widow bartley and our tribe  i watch their face to see if anyth had been happen but i couldnt tell toward the middl of the day the undertak come with his man and they set the coffin in the middl of the room on a coupl of chair and then set all our chair in row and borrow more from the neighbor till the hall and the parlor and the dine room was full  i see the coffin lid was the way it was befor but i dasnt go to look in under it with folk around then the peopl begun to flock in and the beat and the girl took seat in the front row at the head of the coffin and for a half an hour the peopl file around slow in singl rank and look down at the dead man face a minut and some drop in a tear and it was all veri still and solemn onli the girl and the beat hold handkerchief to their eye and keep their head bent and sob a littl  there warnt no other sound but the scrape of the feet on the floor and blow nosesbecaus peopl alway blow them more at a funer than they do at other place except church when the place was pack full the undertak he slid around in his black glove with his softi soother way put on the last touch and get peopl and thing all ship shape and comfort and make no more sound than a cat  he never spoke he move peopl around he squeez in late one he open up passageway and done it with nod and sign with his hand  then he took his place over against the wall he was the softest glidingest stealthiest man i ever see and there warnt no more smile to him than there is to a ham they had borrow a melodeuma sick one and when everyth was readi a young woman set down and work it and it was pretti skreeki and colicki and everybodi join in and sung and peter was the onli one that had a good thing accord to my notion  then the reverend hobson open up slow and solemn and begun to talk and straight off the most outrag row bust out in the cellar a bodi ever heard it was onli one dog but he made a most power racket and he kept it up right along the parson he had to stand there over the coffin and waityou couldnt hear yourself think  it was right down awkward and nobodi didnt seem to know what to do  but pretti soon they see that long leg undertak make a sign to the preacher as much as to say dont you worryjust depend on me  then he stoop down and begun to glide along the wall just his shoulder show over the peopl head  so he glide along and the powwow and racket get more and more outrag all the time and at last when he had gone around two side of the room he disappear down cellar  then in about two second we heard a whack and the dog he finish up with a most amaz howl or two and then everyth was dead still and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off  in a minut or two here come this undertak back and shoulder glide along the wall again and so he glide and glide around three side of the room and then rose up and shade his mouth with his hand and stretch his neck out toward the preacher over the peopl head and say in a kind of a coars whisper he had a rat  then he droop down and glide along the wall again to his place  you could see it was a great satisfact to the peopl becaus natur they want to know  a littl thing like that dont cost noth and it just the littl thing that make a man to be look up to and like  there warnt no more popular man in town than what that undertak was well the funer sermon was veri good but pison long and tiresom and then the king he shove in and got off some of his usual rubbag and at last the job was through and the undertak begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screw driver  i was in a sweat then and watch him pretti keen but he never meddl at all just slid the lid along as soft as mush and screw it down tight and fast  so there i was  i didnt know whether the money was in there or not  so say i spose somebodi has hog that bag on the slynow how do i know whether to write to mari jane or not spose she dug him up and didnt find noth what would she think of me blame it i say i might get hunt up and jail id better lay low and keep dark and not write at all the thing aw mix now tri to better it ive worsen it a hundr time and i wish to good id just let it alon dad fetch the whole busi they buri him and we come back home and i went to watch face againi couldnt help it and i couldnt rest easi  but noth come of it the face didnt tell me noth the king he visit around in the even and sweeten everybodi up and made himself ever so friend and he give out the idea that his congreg over in england would be in a sweat about him so he must hurri and settl up the estat right away and leav for home  he was veri sorri he was so push and so was everybodi they wish he could stay longer but they said they could see it couldnt be done  and he said of cours him and william would take the girl home with them and that pleas everybodi too becaus then the girl would be well fix and amongst their own relat and it pleas the girl tootickl them so they clean forgot they ever had a troubl in the world and told him to sell out as quick as he want to they would be readi  them poor thing was that glad and happi it made my heart ach to see them get fool and lie to so but i didnt see no safe way for me to chip in and chang the general tune well blame if the king didnt bill the hous and the nigger and all the properti for auction straight offsal two day after the funer but anybodi could buy privat beforehand if they want to so the next day after the funer along about noon time the girl joy got the first jolt  a coupl of nigger trader come along and the king sold them the nigger reason for three day draft as they call it and away they went the two son up the river to memphi and their mother down the river to orlean  i thought them poor girl and them nigger would break their heart for grief they cri around each other and took on so it most made me down sick to see it  the girl said they hadnt ever dream of see the famili separ or sold away from the town  i cant ever get it out of my memori the sight of them poor miser girl and nigger hang around each other neck and cri and i reckon i couldnt a stood it all but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if i hadnt know the sale warnt no account and the nigger would be back home in a week or two the thing made a big stir in the town too and a good mani come out flatfoot and said it was scandal to separ the mother and the children that way  it injur the fraud some but the old fool he bull right along spite of all the duke could say or do and i tell you the duke was power uneasi next day was auction day  about broad day in the morn the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up and i see by their look that there was troubl  the king say was

act anyway much as fur as i see they tipto away so i seen easi enough that theyd shove in there to do up your majesti room or someth spose you was up and found you warnt up and so they was hope to slide out of the way of troubl without wake you up if they hadnt alreadi wake you up great gun this is a go say the king and both of them look pretti sick and toler silli  they stood there a think and scratch their head a minut and the duke he bust into a kind of a littl raspi chuckl and say it doe beat all how neat the nigger play their hand  they let on to be sorri they was go out of this region  and i believ they was sorri and so did you and so did everybodi  dont ever tell me ani more that a nigger aint got ani histrion talent  whi the way they play that thing it would fool anybodi  in my opinion there a fortun in em  if i had capit and a theater i wouldnt want a better lay out than thatand here weve gone and sold em for a song  ye and aint privileg to sing the song yet  say where is

becaus now if i could tip her the wink shed light out and save me and blow on our dead beat well we swarm along down the river road just carri on like wildcat and to make it more scari the sky was

the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo mark  if they didnt find them i couldnt bear to think about it and yet somehow i couldnt think about noth els  it got darker and darker and it was a beauti time to give the crowd the slip but that big huski had me by the wristhinesand a bodi might as well tri to give goliar the slip  he drag me right along he was so excit and i had to run to keep up when they got there they swarm into the graveyard and wash over it like an overflow  and when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundr time as mani shovel as they want but nobodi hadnt thought to fetch a lantern  but they sail into dig anyway by the flicker of the lightn and sent a man to the nearest hous a half a mile off to borrow one so they dug and dug like everyth and it got aw dark and the rain start and the wind swish and swush along and the lightn come brisker and brisker and the thunder boom but them peopl never took no notic of it they was so full of this busi and one minut you could see everyth and everi face in that big crowd and the shovel of dirt sail up out of the grave and the next second the dark wipe it all out and you couldnt see noth at all at last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid and then such anoth crowd and shoulder and shove as there was to scroug in and get a sight you never see and in the dark that way it was aw  hine he hurt my wrist dread pull and tug so and i reckon he clean forgot i was in the world he was so excit and pant all of a sudden the lightn let go a perfect sluic of white glare and somebodi sing out by the live jingo here the bag of gold on his breast hine let out a whoop like everybodi els and drop my wrist and give a big surg to bust his way in and get a look and the way i lit out and shin for the road in the dark there aint nobodi can tell i had the road all to myself and i fair flewleastway i had it all to myself except the solid dark and the now and then glare and the buzz of the rain and the thrash of the wind and the split of the thunder and sure as you are born i did clip it along when i struck the town i see there warnt nobodi out in the storm so i never hunt for no back street but hump it straight through the main one and when i begun to get toward our hous i aim my eye and set it no light there the hous all darkwhich made me feel sorri and disappoint i didnt know whi  but at last just as i was sail by flash come the light in mari jane window and my heart swell up sudden like to bust and the same second the hous and all was behind me in the dark and wasnt ever go to be befor me no more in this world she was the best girl i ever see and had the most sand the minut i was far enough abov the town to see i could make the towhead i begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow and the first time the lightn show me one that wasnt chain i snatch it and shove it was a cano and warnt fasten with noth but a rope  the towhead was a rattl big distanc off away out there in the middl of the river but i didnt lose no time and when i struck the raft at last i was so fag i would a just laid down to blow and gasp if i could afford it  but i didnt  as i sprung aboard i sung out out with you jim and set her loos  glori be to good were shut of them jim lit out and was a come for me with both arm spread he was so full of joy but when i glimps him in the lightn my heart shot up in my mouth and i went overboard backward for i forgot he was old king lear and a drownd a rab all in one and it most scare the liver and light out of me  but jim fish me out and was go to hug me and bless me and so on he was so glad i was back and we was shut of the king and the duke but i say not now have it for breakfast have it for breakfast  cut loos and let her slide so in two second

timesi couldnt help it but about the third crack i notic a sound that i know mighti well and held my breath and listen and wait and sure enough when the next flash bust out over the water here they comeand just a lay to their oar and make their skiff hum  it was the king and the duke so i wilt right down on to the plank then and give up and it was all i could do to keep from cri chapter xxx when

one thing or anoth and scoop it all the king say timid and still a snuffl whi duke it was you that said make up the deffisit it warnt me dri up  i dont want to hear no more out of you say the duke  and now you see what you got by it  theyv got all their own money back and all of ourn but a shekel or two besid  glong to bed and dont you deffersit me no more deffersit long s you live so the king sneak into the wigwam and took to his bottl for comfort and befor long the duke tackl his bottl and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thiev again and the tighter they got the loving they got and went off a snore in each other arm  they both got power mellow but i notic the king didnt get mellow enough to forget to rememb to not deni about hide the money bag again  that made me feel easi and satisfi  of cours when they got to snore we had a long gabbl and i told jim everyth chapter xxxi we dasnt stop again at ani town for day and day kept right along down the river  we was down south in the warm weather now and a mighti long way from home  we begun to come to tree with spanish moss on them hang down from the limb like long gray beard  it was the first i ever see it grow and it made the wood look solemn and dismal  so now the fraud reckon they was out of danger and they begun to work the villag again first they done a lectur on temper but they didnt make enough for them both to get drunk on  then in anoth villag they start a danc school but they didnt know no more how to danc than a kangaroo doe so the first pranc they made the general public jump in and pranc them out of town  anoth time they tri to go at yellocut but they didnt yellocut long till the audienc got up and give them a solid good cuss and made them skip out  they tackl missionari and mesmer and doctor and tell fortun and a littl of everyth but they couldnt seem to have no luck  so at last they got just about dead broke and laid around the raft as she float along think and think and never say noth by the half a day at a time and dread blue and desper and at last they took a chang and begun to lay their head togeth in the wigwam and talk low and confidenti two or three hour at a time jim and me got uneasi  we didnt like the look of it  we judg they was studi up some kind of wors deviltri than ever  we turn it over and over and at last we made up our mind they was go to break into somebodi hous or store or was go into the counterfeit money busi or someth so then we was pretti scare and made up an agreement that we wouldnt have noth in the world to do with such action and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leav them behind well earli one morn we hid the raft in a good safe place about two mile below a littl bit of a shabbi villag name pikesvill and the king he went ashor and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybodi had got ani wind of the royal nonesuch there yet hous to rob you mean say i to myself and when you get through rob it youll come back here and wonder what has becom of me and jim and the raftand youll have to take it out in wonder and he said if he warnt back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right and we was to come along so we stay where we was  the duke he fret and sweat around and was in a mighti sour way  he scold us for everyth and we couldnt seem to do noth right he found fault with everi littl thing someth was a brew sure  i was good and glad when midday come and no king we could have a chang anywayand mayb a chanc for the chang on top of it  so me and the duke went up to the villag and hunt around there for the king and by and by we found him in the back room of a littl low doggeri veri tight and a lot of loafer bullyrag him for sport and he a cuss and a threaten with all his might and so tight he couldnt walk and couldnt do noth to them  the duke he begun to abus him for an old fool and the king begun to sass back and the minut they was fair at it i lit out and shook the reef out of my hind leg and spun down the river road like a deer for i see our chanc and i made up my mind that it would be a long day befor they ever see me and jim again  i got down there all out of breath but load up with joy and sung out set her loos jim were all right now but there warnt no answer and nobodi come out of the wigwam  jim was gone  i set up a shoutand then anotherand then anoth one and run this way and that in the wood whoop and screech but it warnt no useold jim was gone  then i set down and cri i couldnt help it but i couldnt set still long  pretti soon i went out on the road tri to think what i better do and i run across a boy walk and ask him if hed seen a strang nigger dress so and so and he say yes whereabout say i down to sila phelp place two mile below here  hes a runaway nigger and theyv got him  was you look for him you bet i aint  i run across him in the wood about an hour or two ago and he said if i holler hed cut my liver outand told me to lay down and stay where i was and i done it  been there ever sinc afeard to come out well he say you neednt be afeard no more becuz theyv got him he run off fm down south somer it a good job they got him well i reckon  there two hunderd dollar reward on him  it like pick up money outn the road yes it isand i could a had it if id been big enough i see him first who nail him it was an old fellowa strangerand he sold out his chanc in him for forti dollar becuz hes got to go up the river and cant wait  think o that now  you bet id wait if it was seven year that me everi time say i  but mayb his chanc aint worth no more than that if hell sell it so cheap  mayb there someth aint straight about it but it is thoughstraight as a string  i see the

toback wont ye i didnt have none so he left  i went to the raft and set down in the wigwam to think  but i couldnt come to noth  i thought till i wore my head sore but i couldnt see no way out of the troubl  after all this long journey and after all wed done for them scoundrel here it was all come to noth everyth all bust up and ruin becaus they could have the heart to serv jim such a trick as that and make him a slave again all his life and amongst stranger too for forti dirti dollar onc i said to myself it would be a thousand time better for jim to be a slave at home where his famili was as long as hed got to be a slave and so id better write a letter to tom sawyer and tell him to tell miss watson where he was  but i soon give up that notion for two thing shed be mad and disgust at his rascal and ungrat for leav her and so shed sell him straight down the river again and if she didnt everybodi natur despis an ungrat nigger and theyd make jim feel it all the time and so hed feel orneri and disgrac and then think of me  it would get all around that huck finn help a nigger to get his freedom and if i was ever to see anybodi from that town again id be readi to get down and lick his boot for shame  that just the way  a person doe a low down thing and then he dont want to take no consequ of it think as long as he can hide it it aint no disgrac  that was my fix exact the more i studi about this the more my conscienc went to grind me and the more wick and low down and orneri i got to feel and at last when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of provid slap me in the face and let me know my wicked was be watch all the time from up there in heaven whilst i was steal a poor old woman nigger that hadnt ever done me no harm and now was show me there one that alway on the lookout and aint a go to allow no such miser do to go onli just so fur and no further i most drop in my track i was so scare  well i tri the best i could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by say i was brung up wick and so i warnt so much to blame but someth insid of me kept say there was the sunday school you could a gone to it and if youd a done it theyd a learnt you there that peopl that act as id been act about that nigger goe to everlast fire it made me shiver  and i about made up my mind to pray and see if i couldnt tri to quit be the kind of a boy i was and be better  so i kneel down  but the word wouldnt come  whi wouldnt they  it warnt no use to tri and hide it from him  nor from me neither  i know veri well whi they wouldnt come  it was becaus my heart warnt right it was becaus i warnt squar it was becaus i was play doubl  i was let on to give up sin but away insid of me i was hold on to the biggest one of all  i was tri to make my mouth say i would do the right thing and the clean thing and go and write to that nigger owner and tell where he was but deep down in me i know it was a lie and he know it  you cant pray a liei found that out so i was full of troubl full as i could be and didnt know what to do at last i had an idea and i say ill go and write the letterand then see if i can pray  whi it was astonish the way i felt as light as a feather right straight off and my troubl all gone  so i got a piec of paper and a pencil all glad and excit and set down and wrote miss watson your runaway nigger jim is down here two mile below pikesvill and mr phelp has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send huck finn i felt good and all wash clean of sin for the first time i had ever felt so in my life and i know i could pray now  but i didnt do it straight off but laid the paper down and set there thinkingthink how good it was all this happen so and how near i come to be lost and go to hell  and went on think  and got to think over our trip down the river and i see jim befor me all the time  in the day and in the night time sometim moonlight sometim storm and we a float along talk and sing and laugh  but somehow i couldnt seem to strike no place to harden me against him but onli the other kind  id see him stand my watch on top of hisn stead of call me so i could go on sleep and see him how glad he was when i come back out of the fog and when i come to him again in the swamp up there where the feud was and such like time and would alway call me honey and pet me and do everyth he could think of for me and how good he alway was and at last i struck the time i save him by tell the men we had small pox aboard and he was so grate and said i was the best friend old jim ever had in the world and the onli one hes got now and then i happen to look around and see that paper it was a close place  i took it up and held it in my hand  i was a trembl becaus id got to decid forev betwixt two thing and i know it  i studi a minut sort of hold my breath and then say to myself all right then ill go to helland tore it up it was aw thought and aw word but they was said  and i let them stay said and never thought no more about reform  i shove the whole thing out of my head and said i would take up wicked again which was in my line be brung up to it and the other warnt  and for a starter i would go to work and steal jim out of slaveri again and if i could think up anyth wors i would do that too becaus as long as i was in and in for good i might as well go the whole hog then i set to think over how to get at it and turn over some consider mani way in my mind and at last fix up a plan that suit me  so then i took the bear of a woodi island that was down the river a piec and as soon as it was fair dark i crept out with my raft and went for it and hid it there and then turn in  i slept the night through and got up befor it was light and had my breakfast and put on my store cloth and tie up some other and one thing or anoth in a bundl and took the cano and clear for shore  i land below where i judg was phelpss place and hid my bundl in the wood and then fill up the cano with water and load rock into her and sunk her where i could find her again when i want her about a quarter of a mile below a littl steam sawmil that was on the bank then i struck up the road and when i pass the mill i see a sign on it phelpss sawmil and when i come to the farm hous two or three hundr yard further along i kept my eye peel but didnt see nobodi around though it was good daylight now  but i didnt mind becaus i didnt want to see nobodi just yeti onli want to get the lay of the land accord to my plan i was go to turn up there from the villag not from below  so i just took a look and shove along straight for town well the veri first man i see when i got there was the duke  he was stick up a bill for the royal nonesuchthre night performancelik that other time  they had the cheek them fraud  i was right on him befor i could shirk  he look astonish and say hel lo  where you come from  then he say kind of glad and eager where the raftgot her in a good place i say whi that just what i was go to ask your grace then he didnt look so joy and say what was your idea for ask me he say well i say when i see the king in that doggeri yesterday i say to myself we cant get him home for hour till hes sober so i went a loaf around town to put in the time and wait  a man up and offer me ten cent to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep and so i went along but when we was drag him to the boat and the man left me a holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along he was too strong for me and jerk loos and run and we after him  we didnt have no dog and so we had to chase him all over the countri till we tire him out  we never got him till dark then we fetch him over and i start down for the raft  when i got there and see it was gone i say to myself theyv got into troubl and had to leav and theyv took my nigger which is the onli nigger ive got in the world and now im in a strang countri and aint got no properti no more nor noth and no way to make my live so i set down and cri  i slept in the wood all night  but what did becom of the raft thenand jimpoor jim blame if i knowthat is what becom of the raft  that old fool had made a trade and got forti dollar and when we found him in the doggeri the loafer had match half dollar with him and got everi cent but what hed spent for whiski and when i got him home late last night and found the raft gone we said that littl rascal has stole our raft and shook us and run off down the river i wouldnt shake my nigger would ith onli nigger i had in the world and the onli properti we never thought of that  fact is i reckon wed come to consid him our nigger yes we did consid him sogood know we had troubl enough for him  so when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke there warnt anyth for it but to tri the royal nonesuch anoth shake and ive peg along ever sinc dri as a powder horn  where that ten cent give it here i had consider money so i give him ten cent but beg him to spend it for someth to eat and give me some becaus it was all the money i had and i hadnt had noth to eat sinc yesterday  he never said noth  the next minut he whirl on me and say do you reckon that nigger would blow on us  wed skin him if he done that how can he blow  haint he run off no  that old fool sold him and never divid with me and the money gone sold him  i say and begun to cri whi he was my nigger and that was my money  where is hei want my nigger well you cant get your nigger that allso dri up your blubber looki heredo you think youd ventur to blow on us  blame if i think id trust you  whi if you was to

my nigger he look kinder bother and stood there with his bill flutter on his arm think and wrinkl up his forehead  at last he say ill tell you someth  we got to be here three day  if youll promis you wont blow and wont let the nigger blow ill tell you where to find him so i promis and he say a farmer by the name of sila ph and then he stop  you see he start to tell me the truth but when he stop that way and begun to studi and think again i reckon he was chang his mind  and so he was he wouldnt trust me he want to make sure of have me out of the way the whole three day  so pretti soon he say

toward phelp  i reckon i better start in on my plan straight off without fool around becaus i want to stop jim mouth till these fellow could get away  i didnt want no troubl with their kind  id seen

bet  watermelon show man lock show prison and it aint like there two prison on such a littl plantat and where the peopl all so kind and good  jim the prison  all rightim glad we found it out detect fashion i wouldnt give shuck for ani other way  now you work your mind and studi out a plan to steal jim and i will studi out one too and well take the one we like the best what a head for just a boy to have  if i had tom sawyer head i wouldnt trade it off to be a duke nor mate of a steamboat nor clown in a circus nor noth i can think of  i went to think out a plan but onli just to be do someth i know veri well where the right plan was go to come from  pretti soon tom say readi yes i say all rightbr it out my plan is this i say  we can easi find out if it jim in there then get up my cano to morrow night and fetch my raft over from the island  then the first dark night that come steal the key out of the old man britch after he goe to bed and shove off down the river on the raft with jim hide daytim and run night the way me and jim use to do befor  wouldnt that plan work work  whi certn it would work like rat a fight  but it too blame simpl there aint noth to it  what the good of a plan that aint no more troubl than that  it as mild as goos milk  whi huck it wouldnt make no more talk than break into a soap factori i never said noth becaus i warnt expect noth differ but i know mighti well that whenev he got his plan readi it wouldnt have none of them object to it and it didnt  he told me what it was and i see in a minut it was worth fifteen of mine for style and would make jim just as free a man as mine would and mayb get us all kill besid  so i was satisfi and said we would waltz in on it  i neednt tell what it was here becaus i know it wouldnt stay the way it was  i know he would be chang it around everi which way as we went along and heav in new bulli wherev he got a chanc  and that is what he done well one thing was dead sure and that was that tom sawyer was in earnest and was actuli go to help steal that nigger out of slaveri that was the thing that was too mani for me  here was a boy that was respect and well brung up and had a charact to lose and folk at home that had charact and he was bright and not leather head and know and not ignor and not mean but kind and yet here he was without ani more pride or right or feel than to stoop to this busi and make himself a shame and his famili a shame befor everybodi  i couldnt understand it no way at all  it was outrag and i know i ought to just up and tell him so and so be his true friend and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself and i did start to tell him but he shut me up and say dont you reckon i know what im about  dont i gener know what im about yes didnt i say i was go to help steal the nigger yes well then that all he said and that all i said  it warnt no use to say ani more becaus when he said hed do a thing he alway done it  but i couldnt make out how he was will to go into this thing so i just let it go and never bother no more about it  if he was bound to have it so i couldnt help it when we got home the hous was all dark and still so we went on down to the hut by the ash hopper for to examin it  we went through the yard so as to see what the hound would do  they know us and didnt make no more nois than countri dog is alway do when anyth come by in the night  when we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two side and on the side i warnt acquaint withwhich was the north sidew found a squar window hole up toler high with just one stout board nail across it  i say here the ticket  this hole big enough for jim to get through if we wrench off the board tom say it as simpl as tit tat toe three in a row and as easi as play hooki  i should hope we can find a way that a littl more complic than that huck finn well then i say how ll it do to saw him out the way i done befor i was murder that time that more like he say  it real mysteri and troublesom and good he say but i bet we can find a way that twice as long  there aint no hurri les keep on look around betwixt the hut and the fenc on the back side was a lean to that join the hut at the eav and was made out of plank  it was as long as the hut but narrowon about six foot wide  the door to it was at the south end and was padlock  tom he went to the soap kettl and search around and fetch back the iron thing they lift the lid with so he took it and prize out one of the stapl  the chain fell down and we open the door and went in and shut it and struck a match and see the shed was onli built against a cabin and hadnt no connect with it and there warnt no floor to the shed nor noth in it but some old rusti play out hoe and spade and pick and a crippl plow  the match went out and so did we and shove in the stapl again and the door was lock as good as ever tom was joy  he say now were all right  well dig him out  it ll take about a week then we start for the hous and i went in the back dooryou onli have to pull a buckskin latch string they dont fasten the doorsbut that warnt romant enough for tom sawyer no way would do him but he must climb up the lightn rod  but after he got up half way about three time and miss fire and fell everi time and the last time most bust his brain out he thought hed got to give it up but after he was rest he allow he would give her one more turn for luck and this time he made the trip in the morn we was up at break of day and down to the nigger cabin to pet the dog and make friend with the nigger that fed jimif it was jim that was be fed  the nigger was just get through breakfast and start for the field and jim nigger was pile up a tin pan with bread and meat and thing and whilst the other was leav the key come from the hous this nigger had a good natur chuckl head face and his wool was all tie up in littl bunch with thread  that was to keep witch off  he said the witch was pester him aw these night and make him see all kind of strang thing and hear all kind of strang word and nois and he didnt believ he was ever witch so long befor in his life  he got so work up and got to run on so about his troubl he forgot all about what hed been a go to do  so tom say what the vittl for  go to feed the dog the nigger kind of smile around gradual over his face like when you heav a brickbat in a mud puddl and he say yes mar sid a dog  curus dog too  doe you want to go en look at im yes i hunch tom and whisper you go right here in the daybreak   that warnt the plan no it warnt but it the plan now so drat him we went along but i didnt like it much  when we got in we couldnt hard see anyth it was so dark but jim was there sure enough and could see us and he sing out whi huck  en good lan ain dat misto tom i just know how it would be i just expect it  i didnt know noth to do and if i had i couldnt a done it becaus that nigger bust in and say whi de gracious sake do he know you genlmen we could see pretti well now  tom he look at the nigger steadi and kind of wonder and say doe who know us whi dis yer runaway nigger i dont reckon he doe but what put that into your head what put it dar  didn he jis dis minut sing out like he know you tom say in a puzzl up kind of way well that mighti curious   who sung out when did he sing out   what did he sing out and turn to me perfect cam and say did you hear anybodi sing out of cours there warnt noth to be said but the one thing so i say no i aint heard nobodi say noth then he turn to jim and look him over like he never see him befor and say did you sing out no sah say jim i haint said noth sah not a word no sah i haint said a word did you ever see us befor no sah not as i know on so tom turn to the nigger which was look wild and distress and say kind of sever what do you reckon the matter with you anyway  what made you think somebodi sung out oh it de dad blame witch sah en i wisht i was dead i do  dey awluz at it sah en dey do mos kill me dey skyer me so  pleas to dont tell nobodi bout it sah er ole mar sila hell scole me kase he say dey aint no witch  i jis wish to good he was heah now den what would he say  i jis bet he couldn fine no way to git aroun it dis time  but it awluz jis so peopl dat sot stay sot dey wont look into nothnen fine it out fr deyselv en when you fine it out en tell um bout it dey doan bliev you tom give him a dime and said we wouldnt tell nobodi and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with and then look at jim and say i wonder if uncl sila is go to hang this nigger  if i was to catch a nigger that was ungrat enough to run away i wouldnt give him up id hang him  and whilst the nigger step to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good he whisper to jim and say dont ever let on to know us  and if you hear ani dig go on night it us were go to set you free jim onli had time to grab us by the hand and squeez it then the nigger come back and we said wed come again some time if the nigger want us to and he said he would more particular if it was dark becaus the witch went for him most in the dark and it was good to have folk around then chapter xxxv it would be most an hour yet till breakfast so we left and struck down into the wood becaus tom said we got to have some light to see how to dig by and a lantern make too much and might get us into troubl what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunk that call fox fire and just make a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place  we fetch an arm and hid it in the weed and set down to rest and tom say kind of dissatisfi blame it this whole thing is just as easi and awkward as it can be and so it make it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan  there aint no watchman to be druggednow there ought to be a watchman  there aint even a dog to give a sleep mixtur to  and there jim chain by one leg with a ten foot chain to the leg of his bed  whi all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain  and uncl sila he trust everybodi send the key to the punkin head nigger and dont send nobodi to watch the nigger  jim could a got out of that window hole befor this onli there wouldnt be no use tri to travel with a ten foot chain on his leg  whi drat it huck it the stupidest arrang i ever see you got to invent all the difficulti  well we cant help it we got to do the best we can with the materi weve got anyhow there one thingther more honor in get him out through a lot of difficulti and danger where there warnt one of them furnish to you by the peopl who it was their duti to furnish them and you had to contriv them all out of your own head  now look at just that one thing of the lantern  when you come down to the cold fact we simpli got to let on that a lantern reski  whi we could work with a torchlight process if we want to i believ  now whilst i think of it we got to hunt up someth to make a saw out of the first chanc we get what do we want of a saw what do we want of it  haint we got to saw the leg of jim bed off so as to get the chain loos whi you just said a bodi could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off well if that aint just like you huck finn  you can get up the infant schooliest way of go at a thing  whi haint you ever read ani book at allbaron trenck nor casanova nor benvenuto chelleeni nor henri iv nor none of them hero  who ever heard of get a prison loos in such an old maidi way as that  no the way all the best author doe is to saw the bed leg in two and leav it just so and swallow the sawdust so it cant be found and put some dirt and greas around the saw place so the veri keenest senesk cant see no sign of it be saw and think the bed leg is perfect sound then the night your readi fetch the leg a kick down she goe slip off your chain and there you are  noth to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlement shin down it break your leg in the moatbecaus a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short you knowand there your hors and your trusti vassl and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddl and away you go to your nativ langudoc or navarr or wherev it is it gaudi huck  i wish there was a moat to this cabin if we get time the night of the escap well dig one i say what do we want of a moat when were go to snake him out from under the cabin but he never heard me  he had forgot me and everyth els  he had his chin in his hand think  pretti soon he sigh and shake his head then sigh again and say no it wouldnt dother aint necess enough for it for what  i say whi to saw jim leg off he say good land  i say whi there aint no necess for it  and what would you want to saw his leg off for anyway well some of the best author has done it  they couldnt get the chain off so they just cut their hand off and shove  and a leg would be better still  but we got to let that go  there aint necess enough in this case and besid jim a nigger and wouldnt understand the reason for it and how it the custom in europ so well let it go  but there one thingh can have a rope ladder we can tear up our sheet and make him a rope ladder easi enough  and we can send it to him in a pie it most done that way  and ive et wors pie whi tom sawyer how you talk i say jim aint got no use for a rope ladder he has got use for it  how you talk you better say you dont know noth about it  hes got to have a rope ladder they all do what in the nation can he do with it do with it  he can hide it in his bed cant he  that what they all do and hes got to too  huck you dont ever seem to want to do anyth that regular you want to be start someth fresh all the time spose he dont do noth with it aint it there in his bed for a clew after hes gone and dont you reckon theyll want clew  of cours they will  and you wouldnt leav them ani  that would be a pretti howdi do wouldnt it  i never heard of such a thing well i say if it in the regul and hes got to have it all right let him have it becaus i dont wish to go back on no regul but there one thing tom sawyerif we go to tear up our sheet to make jim a rope ladder were go to get into troubl with aunt salli just as sure as your born  now the way i look at it a hickri bark ladder dont cost noth and dont wast noth and is just as good to load up a pie with and hide in a straw tick as ani rag ladder you can start and as for jim he aint had no experi and so he dont care what kind of a oh shuck huck finn if i was as ignor as you id keep stillthat what id do  who ever heard of a state prison escap by a hickri bark ladder  whi it perfect ridicul well all right tom fix it your own way but if youll take my advic youll let me borrow a sheet off of the clotheslin he said that would do  and that gave him anoth idea and he say borrow a shirt too what do we want of a shirt tom want it for jim to keep a journal on journal your granni jim cant write spose he cant writeh can make mark on the shirt cant he if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piec of an old iron barrel hoop whi tom we can pull a feather out of a goos and make him a better one and quicker too prison dont have gees run around the donjon keep to pull pen out of you muggin  they alway make their pen out of the hardest toughest troublesomest piec of old brass candlestick or someth like that they can get their hand on and it take them week and week and month and month to file it out too becaus theyv got to do it by rub it on the wall   they wouldnt use a goos quill if they had it it aint regular well then whatll we make him the ink out of mani make it out of iron rust and tear but that the common sort and women the best author use their own blood  jim can do that and when he want to send ani littl common ordinari mysteri messag to let the world know where hes captiv he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window  the iron mask alway done that and it a blame good way too jim aint got no tin plate  they feed him in a pan that aint noth we can get him some cant nobodi read his plate that aint got anyth to do with it huck finn  all hes got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out  you dont have to be abl to read it whi half the time you cant read anyth a prison write on a tin plate or anywher els well then what the sens in wast the plate whi blame it all it aint the prison plate but it somebodi plate aint it well sposn it is  what doe the prison care whose he broke off there becaus we heard the breakfast horn blow  so we clear out for the hous along dure the morn i borrow a sheet and a white shirt off of the cloth line and i found an old sack and put them in it and we went down and got the fox fire and put that in too  i call it borrow becaus that was what pap alway call it but tom said it warnt borrow it was steal  he said we was repres prison and prison dont care how they get a thing so they get it and nobodi dont blame them for it either  it aint no crime in a prison to steal the thing he need to get away with tom said it his right and so as long as we was repres a prison we had a perfect right to steal anyth on this place we had the least use for to get ourselv out of prison with  he said if we warnt prison it would be a veri differ thing and nobodi but a mean orneri person would steal when he warnt a prison  so we allow we would steal everyth there was that come handi  and yet he made a mighti fuss one day after that when i stole a watermelon out of the nigger patch and eat it and he made me go and give the nigger a dime without tell them what it was for tom said that what he meant was we could steal anyth we need well i say i need the watermelon  but he said i didnt need it to get out of prison with there where the differ was  he said if id a want it to hide a knife in and smuggl it to jim to kill the senesk with it would a been all right  so i let it go at that though i couldnt see no advantag in my repres a prison if i got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold leaf distinct like that everi time i see a chanc to hog a watermelon well as i was say we wait that morn till everybodi was settl down to busi and nobodi in sight around the yard then tom he carri the sack into the lean to whilst i stood off a piec to keep watch  bi and by he come out and we went and set down on the woodpil to talk  he say everyth all right now except tool and that easi fix tool  i say yes tool for what whi to dig with  we aint a go to gnaw him out are we aint them old crippl pick and thing in there good enough to dig a nigger out with  i say he turn on me look piti enough to make a bodi cri and say huck finn did you ever hear of a prison have pick and shovel and all the modern conveni in his wardrob to dig himself out with  now i want to ask youif you got ani reason in you at allwhat kind of a show would that give him to be a hero  whi they might as well lend him the key and done with it  pick and shovelswhi they wouldnt furnish em to a king well then i say if we dont want the pick and shovel what do we want a coupl of case knive to dig the foundat out from under that cabin with yes confound it it foolish tom it dont make no differ how foolish it is it the right wayand it the regular way  and there aint no other way that ever i heard of and ive read all the book that give ani inform about these thing they alway dig out with a case knifeand not through dirt mind you gener it through solid rock  and it take them week and week and week and for ever and ever  whi look at one of them prison in the bottom dungeon of the castl deef in the harbor of marseill that dug himself out that way how long was he at it you reckon i dont know well guess i dont know  a month and a half thirti seven year and he come out in china   that the kind  i wish the bottom of this fortress was solid rock jim dont know nobodi in china what that got to do with it  neither did that other fellow  but your alway a wander off on a side issu  whi cant you stick to the main point all righti dont care where he come out so he come out and jim dont either i reckon  but there one thing anywayjim too old to be dug out with a case knife  he wont last yes he will last too  you dont reckon it go to take thirti seven year to dig out through a dirt foundat do you how long will it take tom well we cant resk be as long as we ought to becaus it maynt take veri long for uncl sila to hear from down there by new orlean  hell hear jim aint from there  then his next move will be to advertis jim or someth like that  so we cant resk be as long dig him out as we ought to  bi right i reckon we ought to be a coupl of year but we cant  thing be so uncertain what i recommend is this  that we realli dig right in as quick as we can and after that we can let on to ourselv that we was at it thirti seven year  then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there an alarm  ye i reckon that ll be the best way now there sens in that i say  let on dont cost noth let on aint no troubl and if it ani object i dont mind let on we was at it a hundr and fifti year  it wouldnt strain me none after i got my hand in  so ill mosey along now and smouch a coupl of case knive smouch three he say we want one to make a saw out of tom if it aint unregular and irreligi to sejest it i say there an old rusti saw blade around yonder stick under the weather board behind the smoke hous he look kind of weari and discourag like and say it aint no use to tri to learn you noth huck  run along and smouch the knivesthre of them  so i done it chapter xxxvi as soon as we reckon everybodi was asleep that night we went down the lightn rod and shut ourselv up in the lean to and got out our pile of fox fire and went to work  we clear everyth out of the way about four or five foot along the middl of the bottom log  tom said he was right behind jim bed now and wed dig in under it and when we got through there couldnt nobodi in the cabin ever know there was ani hole there becaus jim counter pin hung down most to the ground and youd have to rais it up and look under to see the hole  so we dug and dug with the case knive till most midnight and then we was dog tire and our hand was blister and yet you couldnt see wed done anyth hard  at last i say this aint no thirti seven year job this is a thirti eight year job tom sawyer he never said noth  but he sigh and pretti soon he stop dig and then for a good littl while i know that he was think then he say it aint no use huck it aint a go to work  if we was prison it would becaus then wed have as mani year as we want and no hurri and we wouldnt get but a few minut to dig everi day while they was chang watch and so our hand wouldnt get blister and we could keep it up right along year in and year out and do it right and the way it ought to be done  but we cant fool along we got to rush we aint got no time to spare  if we was to put in anoth night this way wed have to knock off for a week to let our hand get wellcouldnt touch a case knife with them sooner well then what we go to do tom ill tell you  it aint right and it aint moral and i wouldnt like it to get out but there aint onli just the one way  we got to dig him out with the pick and let on it case knive now your talk  i say your head get level and level all the time tom sawyer i say  pick is the thing moral or no moral and as for me i dont care shuck for the moral of it nohow  when i start in to steal a nigger or a watermelon or a sunday school book i aint no way particular how it done so it done  what i want is my nigger or what i want is my watermelon or what i want is my sunday school book and if a pick the handiest thing that the thing im a go to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that sunday school book out with and i dont give a dead rat what the author think about it nuther well he say there excus for pick and let on in a case like this if it warnt so i wouldnt approv of it nor i wouldnt stand by and see the rule brokebecaus right is right and wrong is wrong and a bodi aint got no busi do wrong when he aint ignor and know better  it might answer for you to dig jim out with a pick without ani let on becaus you dont know no better but it wouldnt for me becaus i do know better  gimm a case knife he had his own by him but i hand him mine  he flung it down and say gimm a case knife i didnt know just what to dobut then i thought  i scratch around amongst the old tool and got a pickax and give it to him and he took it and went to work and never said a word he was alway just that particular  full of principl so then i got a shovel and then we pick and shovel turn about and made the fur fli  we stuck to it about a half an hour which was as long as we could stand up but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it when i got up stair i look out at the window and see tom do his level best with the lightn rod but he couldnt come it his hand was so sore  at last he say it aint no use it cant be done  what you reckon i better do  cant you think of no way yes i say but i reckon it aint regular  come up the stair and let on it a lightn rod so he done it next day tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the hous for to make some pen for jim out of and six tallow candl and i hung around the nigger cabin and laid for a chanc and stole three tin plate  tom say it wasnt enough but i said nobodi wouldnt ever see the plate that jim throw out becaus theyd fall in the dog fennel and jimpson weed under the window holethen we could tote them back and he could use them over again  so tom was satisfi  then he say now the thing to studi out is how to get the thing to jim take them in through the hole i say when we get it done he onli just look scorn and said someth about nobodi ever heard of such an idiot idea and then he went to studi  bi and by he said he had cipher out two or three way but there warnt no need to decid on ani of them yet  said wed got to post jim first that night we went down the lightn rod a littl after ten and took one of the candl along and listen under the window hole and heard jim snore so we pitch it in and it didnt wake him  then we whirl in with the pick and shovel and in about two hour and a half the job was done  we crept in under jim bed and into the cabin and paw around and found the candl and lit it and stood over jim awhil and found him look hearti and healthi and then we woke him up gentl and gradual  he was so glad to see us he most cri and call us honey and all the pet name he could think of and was for have us hunt up a cold chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away and clear out without lose ani time  but tom he show him how unregular it would be and set down and told him all about our plan and how we could alter them in a minut ani time there was an alarm and not to be the least afraid becaus we would see he got away sure  so jim he said it was all right and we set there and talk over old time awhil and then tom ask a lot of question and when jim told him uncl sila come in everi day or two to pray with him and aunt salli come in to see if he was comfort and had plenti to eat and both of them was kind as they could be tom say now i know how to fix it  well send you some thing by them i said dont do noth of the kind it one of the most jackass idea i ever struck but he never paid no attent to me went right on  it was his way when hed got his plan set so he told jim how wed have to smuggl in the rope ladder pie and other larg thing by nat the nigger that fed him and he must be on the lookout and not be surpris and not let nat see him open them and we would put small thing in uncl coat pocket and he must steal them out and we would tie thing to aunt apron string or put them in her apron pocket if we got a chanc and told him what they would be and what they was for  and told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood and all that he told him everyth  jim he couldnt see no sens in the most of it but he allow we was white folk and know better than him so he was satisfi and said he would do it all just as tom said jim had plenti corn cob pipe and tobacco so we had a right down good sociabl time then we crawl out through the hole and so home to bed with hand that look like theyd been chaw  tom was in high spirit he said it was the best fun he ever had in his life and the most intellectur and said if he onli could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our live and leav jim to our children to get out for he believ jim would come to like it better and better the more he got use to it  he said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighti year and would be the best time on record  and he said it would make us all celebr that had a hand in it in the morn we went out to the woodpil and chop up the brass candlestick into handi size and tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket  then we went to the nigger cabin and while i got nat notic off tom shove a piec of candlestick into the middl of a corn pone that was in jim pan and we went along with nat to see how it would work and it just work nobl when jim bit into it it most mash all his teeth out and there warnt ever anyth could a work better tom said so himself jim he never let on but what it was onli just a piec of rock or someth like that that alway get into bread you know but after that he never bit into noth but what he jab his fork into it in three or four place first and whilst we was a stand there in the dimmish light here come a coupl of the hound bulg in from under jim bed and they kept on pile in till there was eleven of them and there warnt hard room in there to get your breath  bi jing we forgot to fasten that lean to door  the nigger nat he onli just holler witch onc and keel over on to the floor amongst the dog and begun to groan like he was die  tom jerk the door open and flung out a slab of jim meat and the dog went for it and in two second he was out himself and back again and shut the door and i know hed fix the other door too then he went to work on the nigger coax him and pet him and ask him if hed been imagin he saw someth again  he rais up and blink his eye around and say mar sid youll say is a fool but if i didnt bliev i see most a million dog er devil er somen i wisht i may die right heah in dese track  i did mos sholi  mar sid i felt umi felt um sah dey was

boot and rag and piec of bottl and wore out tin thing and all such truck and scratch around and found an old tin washpan and stop up the hole as well as we could to bake the pie in and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and start for breakfast and found a coupl of shingl nail that tom said would be handi for a prison to scrabbl his name and sorrow on the dungeon wall with and drop one of them in aunt salli apron pocket which was hang on a chair and tother we stuck in the band of uncl silass hat which was on the bureau becaus we heard the children say their pa and ma was go to the runaway nigger hous this morn and then went to breakfast and tom drop the pewter spoon in uncl silass coat pocket and aunt salli wasnt come yet so we had to wait a littl while and when she come she was hot and red and cross and couldnt hard wait for the bless and then she went to sluic out coffe with one hand and crack the handiest child head with her thimbl with the other and say ive hunt

till the weather moder  she kept a rage right along run her insurrect all by herself and everybodi els mighti meek and quiet and at last uncl sila look kind of foolish fish up that spoon out of his pocket  she stop with her mouth open and her hand up and as for me i wish i was in jeruslem or somewher but not long becaus she say it just as i expect  so you had it in your pocket all the time and like as not youv got the other thing there too  howd it get there i reeli dont know salli he say kind of apolog or you know i would tell  i was a studi over my text in act seventeen befor breakfast and i reckon i put it in there not notic mean to put my testament in and it must be so becaus my testament aint in but ill go and see and if the testament is where i had it ill know i didnt put it in and that will show that i laid the testament down and took up the spoon and oh for the land sake  give a bodi a rest  go long now the whole kit and bile of ye and dont come nigh me again till ive got back my peac of mind id a heard her if shed a said it to herself let alon speak it out and id a got up and obey her if id a been dead  as we was pass through the set room the old man he took up his hat and the shingl nail fell out on the floor and he just mere pick it up and laid it on the mantel shelf and never said noth and went out  tom see him do it and rememb about the spoon and say well it aint no use to send thing by him no more he aint reliabl then he say  but he done us a good turn with the spoon anyway without know it and so well go and do him one without him know itstop up his rat hole there was a nobl good lot of them down cellar and it took us a whole hour but we done the job tight and good and shipshap  then we heard step on the stair and blow out our light and hid and here come the old man with a candl in one hand and a bundl of stuff in tother look as absent mind as year befor last  he went a moon around first to one rat hole and then anoth till hed been to them all  then he stood about five minut pick tallow drip off of his candl and think  then he turn off slow and dreami toward the stair say well for the life of me i cant rememb when i done it  i could show her now that i warnt to blame on account of the rat  but never mindlet it go  i reckon it wouldnt do no good and so he went on a mumbl up stair and then we left  he was a mighti nice old man  and alway is tom was a good deal bother about what to do for a spoon but he said wed got to have it so he took a think  when he had cipher it out he told me how we was to do then we went and wait around the spoon basket till we see aunt salli come and then tom went to count the spoon and lay them out to one side and i slid one of them up my sleev and tom say whi aunt salli there aint but nine spoon yet she say go long to your play and dont bother me  i know better i count m myself well ive count them twice aunti and i cant make but nine she look out of all patienc but of cours she come to countanybodi would i declar to gracious ther aint but nine she say  whi what in the worldplagu take the thing ill count m again so i slip back the one i had and when she got done count she say hang the troublesom rubbag ther ten now and she look huffi and bother both  but tom say whi aunti i dont think there ten you numskul didnt you see me count m i know but well ill count m again so i smouch one and they come out nine same as the other time  well she was in a tear wayjust a trembl all over she was so mad  but she count and count till she got that addl shed start to count in the basket for a spoon sometim and so three time they come out right and three time they come out wrong  then she grab up the basket and slam it across the hous and knock the cat galley west and she said cler out and let her have some peac and if we come bother around her again betwixt that and dinner shed skin us  so we had the odd spoon and drop it in her apron pocket whilst she was a give us our sail order and jim got it all right along with her shingl nail befor noon  we was veri well satisfi with this busi and tom allow it was worth twice the troubl it took becaus he said now she couldnt ever count them spoon twice alik again to save her life and wouldnt believ shed count them right if she did and said that after shed about count her head off for the next three day he judg shed give it up and offer to kill anybodi that want her to ever count them ani more so we put the sheet back on the line that night and stole one out of her closet and kept on put it back and steal it again for a coupl of day till she didnt know how mani sheet she had ani more and she didnt care and warnt a go to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it and wouldnt count them again not to save her life she druther die first so we was all right now as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candl by the help of the calf and the rat and the mix up count and as to the candlestick it warnt no consequ it would blow over by and by but that pie was a job we had no end of troubl with that pie  we fix it up away down in the wood and cook it there and we got it done at last and veri satisfactori too but not all in one day and we had to use up three wash pan full of flour befor we got through and we got burnt pretti much all over in place and eye put out with the smoke becaus you see we didnt want noth but a crust and we couldnt prop it up right and she would alway cave in  but of cours we thought of the right way at lastwhich was to cook the ladder too in the pie  so then we laid in with jim the second night and tore up the sheet all in littl string and twist them togeth and long befor daylight we had a love rope that you could a hung a person with  we let on it took nine month to make it and in the forenoon we took it down to the wood but it wouldnt go into the pie  be made of a whole sheet that way there was rope enough for forti pie if wed a want them and plenti left over for soup or sausag or anyth you choos  we could a had a whole dinner but we didnt need it  all we need was just enough for the pie and so we throw the rest away  we didnt cook none of the pie in the wash panafraid the solder would melt but uncl sila he had a nobl brass warm pan which he thought consider of becaus it belong to one of his ancest with a long wooden handl that come over from england with william the conqueror in the mayflow or one of them earli ship and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pot and thing that was valuabl not on account of be ani account becaus they warnt but on account of them be relict you know and we snake her out privat and took her down there but she fail on the first pie becaus we didnt know how but she come up smile on the last one  we took and line her with dough and set her in the coal and load her up with rag rope and put on a dough roof and shut down the lid and put hot ember on top and stood off five foot with the long handl cool and comfort and in fifteen minut she turn out a pie that was a satisfact to look at but the person that et it would want to fetch a coupl of kag of toothpick along for if that rope ladder wouldnt cramp him down to busi i dont know noth what im talk about and lay him in enough stomach ach to last him till next time too nat didnt look when we put the witch pie in jim pan and we put the three tin plate in the bottom of the pan under the vittl and so jim got everyth all right and as soon as he was by himself he bust into the pie and hid the rope ladder insid of his straw tick and scratch some mark on a tin plate and throw it out of the window hole chapter xxxviii make them pen was a distressid tough job and so was the saw and jim allow the inscript was go to be the toughest of all  that the one which the prison has to scrabbl on the wall  but he had to have it tom said hed got to there warnt no case of a state prison not scrabbl his inscript to leav behind and his coat of arm look at ladi jane grey he say

was read them and he most broke down when he got done he couldnt no way make up his mind which one for jim to scrabbl on to the wall they was all so good but at last he allow he would let him scrabbl them all on  jim said it would take him a year to scrabbl such a lot of truck on to the log with a nail and he didnt know how to make letter besid but tom said he would block them out for him and then he wouldnt have noth to do but just follow the line  then pretti soon he say come to think the log aint a go to do they dont have log wall in a dungeon  we got to dig the inscript into a rock  well fetch a rock jim said the rock was wors than the log he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldnt ever get out  but tom said he would let me help him do it  then he took a look to see how me and jim was get along with the pen  it was most peski tedious hard work and slow and didnt give my hand no show to get well of the sore and we didnt seem to make no headway hard so tom say i know how to fix it  we got to have a rock for the coat of arm and mourn inscript and we can kill two bird with that same rock there a gaudi big grindston down at the mill and well smouch it and carv the thing on it and file out the pen and the saw on it too it warnt no slouch of an idea and it warnt no slouch of a grindston nuther but we allow wed tackl it  it warnt quit

enough to get the grindston through but jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough  then tom mark out them thing on it with the nail and set jim to work on them with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbag in the lean to for a hammer and told him to work till the rest of his candl quit on him and then he could go to bed and hide the grindston under his straw tick and sleep on

pot in the morn jim said he would jis s soon have toback in his coffe and found so much fault with it and with the work and bother of rais the mullen and jew harp the rat and pet and flatter up the snake and spider and thing on top of all the other work he had to do on pen and inscript and journal and thing which made it more troubl and worri and respons to be a prison than anyth he ever undertook that tom most lost all patienc with him and said he was just loaden down with more gaudier chanc than a prison ever had in the world to make a name for himself and yet he didnt know enough to appreci them and they was just about wast on him  so jim he was sorri and said he wouldnt behav so no more and then me and tom shove for bed chapter xxxix in the morn we went up to the villag and bought a wire rat trap and fetch it down and unstop the best rat hole and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of one and then we took it and put it in a safe place under aunt salli bed  but while we was gone for spider littl thoma franklin benjamin jefferson elexand phelp found it there and open the door of it to see if the rat would come out and they did and aunt salli she come in and when we got back she was a stand on top of the bed rais cain and the rat was do what they could to keep off the dull time for her  so she took and dust us both with the hickri and we was as much as two hour catch anoth fifteen or sixteen drat that meddlesom cub and they warnt the likeliest nuther becaus the first haul was the pick of the flock  i never see a likeli lot of rat than what that first haul was we got a splendid stock of sort spider and bug and frog and caterpillar and one thing or anoth and we like to got a hornet nest but we didnt  the famili was at home  we didnt give it right up but stay with them as long as we could becaus we allow wed tire them out or theyd got to tire us out and they done it  then we got allycumpain and rub on the place and was pretti near all right again but couldnt set down conveni  and so we went for the snake and grab a coupl of dozen garter and hous snake and put them in a bag and put it in our room and by that time it was supper time and a rattl good honest day work  and hungryoh no i reckon not  and there warnt a bless snake up there when we went backw didnt half tie the sack and they work out somehow and left  but it didnt matter much becaus they was still on the premis somewher  so we judg we could get some of them again  no there warnt no real scarciti of snake about the hous for a consider spell  youd see them drip from the rafter and place everi now and then and they gener land in your plate or down the back of your neck and most of the time where you didnt want them  well they was handsom and stripe and there warnt no harm in a million of them but that never made no differ to aunt salli she despis snake be the breed what they might and she couldnt stand them no way you could fix it and everi time one of them flop down on her it didnt make no differ what she was do she would just lay that work down and light out  i never see such a woman  and you could hear her whoop to jericho  you couldnt get her to take a holt of one of them with the tong  and if she turn over and found one in bed she would scrambl out and lift a howl that you would think the hous was afir  she disturb the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadnt ever been no snake creat  whi after everi last snake had been gone clear out of the hous for as much as a week aunt salli warnt over it yet she warnt near over it when she was set think about someth you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stock  it was veri curious  but tom said all women was just so  he said they was made that way for some reason or other we got a lick everi time one of our snake come in her way and she allow these lick warnt noth to what she would do if we ever load up the place again with them  i didnt mind the lick becaus they didnt amount to noth but i mind the troubl we had to lay in anoth lot  but we got them laid in and all the other thing and you never see a cabin as blithesom as jim was when theyd all swarm out for music and go for him  jim didnt like the spider and the spider didnt like jim and so theyd lay for him and make it mighti warm for him  and he said that between the rat and the snake and the grindston there warnt no room in bed for him skase and when there was a bodi couldnt sleep it was so live and it was alway live he said becaus they never all slept at one time but took turn about so when the snake was asleep the rat was on deck and when the rat turn in the snake come on watch so he alway had one gang under him in his way and tother gang have a circus over him and if he got up to hunt a new place the spider would take a chanc at him as he cross over he said if he ever got out this time he wouldnt ever be a prison again not for a salari well by the end of three week everyth was in pretti good shape  the shirt was sent in earli in a pie and everi time a rat bit jim he would get up and write a littl in his journal whilst the ink was fresh the pen was made the inscript and so on was all carv on the grindston the bed leg was saw in two and we had et up the sawdust and it give us a most amaz stomach ach  we reckon we was all go to die but didnt  it was the most undigest sawdust i ever see and tom said the same but as i was say wed got all the work done now at last and we was all pretti much fag out too but main jim  the old man had wrote a coupl of time to the plantat below orlean to come and get their runaway nigger but hadnt got no answer becaus there warnt no such plantat so he allow he would advertis jim in the st loui and new orlean paper and when he mention the st loui one it give me the cold shiver and i see we hadnt no time to lose so tom said now for the nonnam letter what them  i say warn to the peopl that someth is up  sometim it done one way sometim anoth  but there alway somebodi spi around that give notic to the governor of the castl  when loui xvi was go to light out of the tooleri a servant girl done it  it a veri good way and so is the nonnam letter  well use them both  and it usual for the prison mother to chang cloth with him and she stay in and he slide out in her cloth  well do that too but looki here tom what do we want to warn anybodi for that someth up  let them find it out for themselvesit their lookout yes i know but you cant depend on them  it the way theyv act from the veri startleft us to do everyth  theyr so confid and mullet head they dont take notic of noth at all  so if we dont give them notic there wont be nobodi nor noth to interfer with us and so after all our hard work and troubl this escap ll go off perfect flat wont amount to nothingwont be noth to it well as for me tom that the way id like shuck he say and look disgust  so i say but i aint go to make no complaint  ani way that suit you suit me what you go to do about the servant girl youll be her  you slide in in the middl of the night and hook that yaller girl frock whi tom that ll make troubl next morn becaus of cours she probbl haint got ani but that one i know but you dont want it but fifteen minut to carri the nonnam letter and shove it under the front door all right then ill do it but i could carri it just as handi in my own tog you wouldnt look like a servant girl then would you no but there wont be nobodi to see what i look like anyway that aint got noth to do with it  the thing for us to do is just to do our duti and not worri about whether anybodi see us do it or not haint you got no principl at all all right i aint say noth im the servant girl  whos jim mother im his mother  ill hook a gown from aunt salli well then youll have to stay in the cabin when me and jim leav not much  ill stuff jim cloth full of straw and lay it on his bed to repres his mother in disguis and jim ll take the nigger woman gown off of me and wear it and well all evad togeth  when a prison of style escap it call an evas  it alway call so when a king escap frinstanc  and the same with a king son it dont make no differ whether hes a natur one or an unnatur one so tom he wrote the nonnam letter and i smouch the yaller wench frock that night and put it on and shove it under the front door the way tom told me to  it said bewar  troubl is brew  keep a sharp lookout unknown friend next night we stuck a pictur which tom draw in blood of a skull and crossbon on the front door and next night anoth one of a coffin on the back door  i never see a famili in such a sweat  they couldnt a been wors scare if the place had a been full of ghost lay for them behind everyth and under the bed and shiver through the air  if a door bang aunt salli she jump and said ouch if anyth fell she jump and said ouch if you happen to touch her when she warnt notic she done the same she couldnt face noway and be satisfi becaus she allow there was someth behind her everi timeso she was alway a whirl around sudden and say ouch and befor shed got two third around shed whirl back again and say it

and out through the hole swift but softjim first me next and tom last which was accord to tom order  now we was in the lean to and heard tramp close by outsid  so we crept to the door and tom stop us there and put his eye to the crack but couldnt make out noth it was so dark and whisper and said he would listen for the step to get further and when he nudg us jim must glide out first and him last  so he set his ear to the crack and listen and listen and listen and the step a scrape around out there all the time and at last he nudg us and we slid out and stoop down not breath and not make the least nois and slip stealthi toward the fenc in injun file and got to it all right and me and jim over it but tom britch catch fast on a splinter on the top rail and then he hear the step come so he had to pull loos which snap the splinter and made a nois and as he drop in our track and start somebodi sing out whos that  answer or ill shoot but we didnt answer we just unfurl our heel and shove  then there was a rush and a bang bang bang and the bullet fair whizz around us we heard them sing out here they are  theyv broke for the river  after em boy and turn loos the dog so here they come full tilt  we could hear them becaus they wore boot and yell but we didnt wear no boot and didnt yell  we was in the path to the mill and when they got pretti close on to us we dodg into the bush and let them go by and then drop in behind them  theyd had all the dog shut up so they wouldnt scare off the robber but by this time somebodi had let them loos and here they come make powwow enough for a million but they was our dog so we stop in our track till they catch up and when they see it warnt nobodi but us and no excit to offer them they onli just said howdi and tore right ahead toward the shout and clatter and then we up steam again and whizz along after them till we was near to the mill and then struck up through the bush to where my cano was tie and hop in and pull for dear life toward the middl of the river but didnt make no more nois than we was obleeg to then we struck out easi and comfort for the island where my raft was and we could hear them yell and bark at each other all up and down the bank till we was so far away the sound got dim and die out  and when we step on to the raft i say now old jim your a free man again and i bet you wont ever be a slave no more en a mighti good job it wuz too huck  it uz plan beauti en it uz done beauti en dey aint nobodi kin git up a plan dat mo mix up en splendid den what dat one wuz we was all glad as we could be but tom was the gladdest of all becaus he had a bullet in the calf of his leg when me and jim heard that we didnt feel so brash as what we did befor it was hurt him consider and bleed so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke shirt for to bandag him but he say gimm the rag i can do it myself  dont stop now dont fool around here and the evas boom along so handsom man the sweep and set her loos  boy we done it elegantde we did  i wish wed a had the handl of loui xvi there wouldnt a been no son of saint loui ascend to heaven wrote down in his biographi no sir wed a whoop him over the border

loos himself but we wouldnt let him  then he give us a piec of his mind but it didnt do no good so when he see me get the cano readi he say well then if your bound to go ill tell you the way to do when you get to the villag  shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast and make him swear to be silent as the grave and put a purs full of gold in his hand and then take and lead him all around the back alley and everywher in the dark and then fetch him here in the cano in a roundabout way amongst the island and search him and take his chalk away from him and dont give it back to him till you get him back to the villag or els he will chalk this raft so he can find it again it the way they all do so i said i would and left and jim was to hide in the wood when he see the doctor come till he was gone again chapter xli the doctor was an old man a veri nice kind look old man when i got him up  i told him me and my brother was over on spanish island hunt yesterday afternoon and camp on a piec of a raft we found and about midnight he must a kick his gun in his dream for it went off and shot him in the leg and we want him to go over there and fix it and not say noth about it nor let anybodi know becaus we want to come home this even and surpris the folk who is your folk he say the phelps down yonder oh he say  and after a minut he say howd you say he got shot he had a dream i say and it shot him singular dream he say so he lit up his lantern and got his saddl bag and we start  but when he see the cano he didnt like the look of hersaid she was big enough for one but didnt look pretti safe for two  i say oh you neednt be afeard sir she carri the three of us easi enough what three whi me and sid andandand the gun that what i mean oh he say but he put his foot on the gunnel and rock her and shook his head and said he reckon hed look around for a bigger one  but they was all lock and chain so he took my cano and said for me to wait till he come back or i could hunt around further or mayb i better go down home and get them readi for the surpris if i want to  but i said i didnt so i told him just how to find the raft and then he start i struck an idea pretti soon  i say to myself sposn he cant fix that leg just in three shake of a sheep tail as the say is sposn it take him three or four day  what are we go to dolay around there till he let the cat out of the bag  no sir i know what ill do  ill wait and when he come back if he say hes got to go ani more ill get down there too if i swim and well take and tie him and keep him and shove out down the river and when tom done with him well give him what it worth or all we got and then let him get ashor so then i crept into a lumber pile to get some sleep and next time i wake up the sun was away up over my head  i shot out and went for the doctor hous but they told me hed gone away in the night some time or other and warnt back yet  well think i that look power bad for tom and ill dig out for the island

we thought we heard them on the water so we got a cano and took out after them and cross over but couldnt find noth of them so we cruis along up shore till we got kind of tire and beat out and tie up the cano and went to sleep and never wake up till about an hour ago then we paddl over here to hear the news and sid at the post offic to see what he can hear and im a branch out to get someth to eat

faculti no more  it look foolish enough now in the daytim but i say to myself there my two poor boy asleep way up stair in that lonesom room and i declar to good i was that uneasi t i crep up there and lock em in  i did  and anybodi would becaus you know when you get scare that way and it keep run on and get wors and wors all the time and your wit get to addl and you get to do all sort o wild thing and by and by you think to yourself sposn i was a boy and was away up there and the door aint lock and you she stop look kind of wonder and then she turn her head around slow and when her eye lit on mei got up and took a walk say i to myself i can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morn if i go out to one side and studi over it a littl  so i done it  but i dasnt go fur or shed a sent for me  and when it was late in the day the peopl all went and then i come in and told her the nois and shoot wake up me and sid and the door was lock and we want to see the fun so we went down the lightn rod and both of us got hurt a littl and we didnt never want to tri that no more  and then i went on and told her all what i told uncl sila befor and then she said shed forgiv us and mayb it was all right enough anyway and about what a bodi might expect of boy for all boy was a pretti harum scarum lot as fur as she could see and so as long as no harm hadnt come of it she judg she better put in her time be grate we was aliv and well and she had us still stead of fret over what was past and done  so then she kiss me and pat me on the head and drop into a kind of a brown studi and pretti soon jump up and say whi lawsamerci it most night and sid not come yet  what has becom of that boy i see my chanc so i skip up and say ill run right up to town and get him i say no you wont she say  youll stay right wher you are one enough to be lost at a time  if he aint here to supper your uncl ll go well he warnt there to supper so right after supper uncl went he come back about ten a littl bit uneasi hadnt run across tom track aunt salli was a good deal uneasi but uncl sila he said there warnt no occas to beboy will be boy he said and youll see this one turn up in the morn all sound and right  so she had to be satisfi  but she said shed set up for him a while anyway and keep a light burn so he could see it and then when i went up to bed she come up with me and fetch her candl and tuck me in and mother me so good i felt mean and like i couldnt look her in the face and she set down on the bed and talk with me a long time and said what a splendid boy sid was and didnt seem to want to ever stop talk about him and kept ask me everi now and then if i reckon he could a got lost or hurt or mayb drownd and might be lay at this minut somewher suffer or dead and she not by him to help him and so the tear would drip down silent and i would tell her that sid was all right and would be home in the morn sure and she would squeez my hand or mayb kiss me and tell me to say it again and keep on say it becaus it done her good and she was in so much troubl  and when she was go away she look down in my eye so steadi and gentl and say the door aint go to be lock tom and there the window and the rod but youll be good wont you  and you wont go  for my sake law know i want to go bad enough to see about tom and was all intend to go but after that i wouldnt a went not for kingdom but she was on my mind and tom was on my mind so i slept veri restless and twice i went down the rod away in the night and slip around front and see her set there by her candl in the window with her eye toward the road and the tear in them and i wish i could do someth for her but i couldnt onli to swear that i wouldnt never do noth to griev her ani more  and the third time i wake up at dawn and slid down and she was there yet and her candl was most out and her old gray head was rest on her hand and she was asleep chapter xlii the old man was uptown again befor breakfast but couldnt get no track of tom and both of them set at the tabl think and not say noth and look mourn and their coffe get cold and not eat anyth and by and by the old man say did i give you the letter what letter the one i got yesterday out of the post offic no you didnt give me no letter well i must a forgot it so he rummag his pocket and then went off somewher where he had laid it down and fetch it and give it to her  she say whi it from st petersburgit from sis i allow anoth walk would do me good but i couldnt stir  but befor she could break it open she drop it and runfor she see someth and so did i it was tom sawyer on a mattress and that old doctor and jim in her calico dress with his hand tie behind him and a lot of peopl  i hid the letter behind the first thing that come handi and rush  she flung herself at tom cri and say oh hes dead hes dead i know hes dead and tom he turn his head a littl and mutter someth or other which show he warnt in his right mind then she flung up her hand and say hes aliv thank god  and that enough and she snatch a kiss of him and flew for the hous to get the bed readi and scatter order right and left at the nigger and everybodi els as fast as her tongu could go everi jump of the way i follow the men to see what they was go to do with jim and the old doctor and uncl sila follow after tom into the hous  the men was veri huffi and some of them want to hang jim for an exampl to all the other nigger around there so they wouldnt be tri to run away like jim done and make such a raft of troubl and keep a whole famili scare most to death for day and night  but the other said dont do it it wouldnt answer at all he aint our nigger and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him sure  so that cool them down a littl becaus the peopl that alway the most anxious for to hang a nigger that haint done just right is alway the veri one that aint the most anxious to pay for him when theyv got their satisfact out of him they cuss jim considerbl though and give him a cuff or two side the head onc in a while but jim never said noth and he never let on to know me and they took him to the same cabin and put his own cloth on him and chain him again and not to no bed leg this time but to a big stapl drove into the bottom log and chain his hand too and both leg and said he warnt to have noth but bread and water to eat after this till his owner come or he was sold at auction becaus he didnt come in a certain length of time and fill up our hole and said a coupl of farmer with gun must stand watch around about the cabin everi night and a bulldog tie to the door in the daytim and about this time they was through with the job and was taper off with a kind of generl good bye cuss and then the old doctor come and take a look and say dont be no rougher on him than your obleeg to becaus he aint a bad nigger  when i got to where i found the boy i see i couldnt cut the bullet out without some help and he warnt in no condit for me to leav to go and get help and he got a littl wors and a littl wors and after a long time he went out of his head and wouldnt let me come a nigh him ani more and said if i chalk his raft hed kill me and no end of wild foolish like that and i see i couldnt do anyth at all with him so i say i got to have help somehow and the minut i say it out crawl this nigger from somewher and say hell help and he done it too and done it veri well  of cours i judg he must be a runaway nigger and there i was and there i had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night  it was a fix i tell you i had a coupl of patient with the chill and of cours id of like to run up to town and see them but i dasnt becaus the nigger might get away and then id be to blame and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail  so there i had to stick plumb until daylight this morn and i never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithful and yet he was risk his freedom to do it and was all tire out too and i see plain enough hed been work main hard late  i like the nigger for that i tell you gentlemen a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollarsand kind treatment too  i had everyth i need and the boy was do as well there as he would a done at homebett mayb becaus it was so quiet but there i was with both of m on my hand and there i had to stick till about dawn this morn then some men in a skiff come by and as good luck would have it the nigger was set by the pallet with his head prop on his knee sound asleep so i motion them in quiet and they slip up on him and grab him and tie him befor he know what he was about and we never had no troubl and the boy be in a kind of a flighti sleep too we muffl the oar and hitch the raft on and tow her over veri nice and quiet and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start  he aint no bad nigger gentlemen that what i think about him somebodi say well it sound veri good doctor im obleeg to say then the other soften up a littl too and i was mighti thank to that old doctor for do jim that good turn and i was glad it was accord to my judgment of him too becaus i thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time i see him  then they all agre that jim had act veri well and was deserv to have some notic took of it and reward  so everi one of them promis right out and hearti that they wouldnt cuss him no more then they come out and lock him up  i hope they was go to say he could have one or two of the chain took off becaus they was rotten heavi or could have meat and green with his bread and water but they didnt think of it and i reckon it warnt best for me to mix in but i judg id get the doctor yarn to aunt salli somehow or other as soon as id got through the breaker that was lay just ahead of meexplan i mean of how i forgot to mention about sid be shot when i was tell how him and me put in that drat night paddl around hunt the runaway nigger but i had plenti time  aunt salli she stuck to the sick room all day and all night and everi time i see uncl sila moon around i dodg him next morn i heard tom was a good deal better and they said aunt salli was gone to get a nap  so i slip to the sick room and if i found him awak i reckon we could put up a yarn for the famili that would wash but he was sleep and sleep veri peac too and pale not fire face the way he was when he come  so i set down and laid for him to wake  in about half an hour aunt salli come glide in and there i was up a stump again  she motion me to be still and set down by me and begun to whisper and said we could all be joy now becaus all the symptom was first rate and hed been sleep like that for ever so long and look better and peaceful all the time and ten to one hed wake up in his right mind so we set there watch and by and by he stir a bit and open his eye veri natur and take a look and say hellowhi im at home  how that  where the raft it all right i say and jim the same i say but couldnt say it pretti brash  but he never notic but say good  splendid   now were all right and safe did you tell aunti i was go to say yes but she chip in and say  about what sid whi about the way the whole thing was done what whole thing whi the whole thing  there aint but one how we set the runaway nigger freem and tom good land  set the runwhat is the child talk about  dear dear out of his head again no i aint out of my head i know all what im talk about  we did set him freem and tom  we laid out to do it and we done it  and we done it eleg too  hed got a start and she never check him up just set and stare and stare and let him clip along and i see it warnt no use for me to put in  whi aunti it cost us a power of workweek of ithour and hour everi night whilst you was all

if she warnt stand right there just insid the door look as sweet and content as an angel half full of pie i wish i may never aunt salli jump for her and most hug the head off of her and cri over her

that would be a pretti howdi do come out from under that bed huck finn so i done it  but not feel brash aunt salli she was one of the mix upest look person i ever seeexcept one and that was uncl sila when he come in and they told it all to him  it kind of made him drunk as you may say and he didnt know noth at all the rest of the day and preach a prayer meet sermon that night that gave him a rattl ruput becaus the oldest man in the world couldnt a understood it  so tom aunt polli she told all about who i was and what and i had to up and tell how i was in such a tight place that when mrs phelp took me for tom sawyersh chip in and say oh go on and call me aunt salli im use to it now and taint no need to changethat when aunt salli took me for tom sawyer i had to stand itther warnt no other way and i know he wouldnt mind becaus it would be nut for him be a mysteri and hed make an adventur out of it and be perfect satisfi  and so it turn out and he let on to be sid and made thing as soft as he could for me and his aunt polli she said tom was right about old miss watson set jim free in her will and so sure enough tom sawyer had gone and took all that troubl and bother to set a free nigger free and i couldnt ever understand befor until that minut and that talk how he could help a bodi set a nigger free with his bring up well aunt polli she said that when aunt salli wrote to her that tom and sid had come all right and safe she say to herself look at that now  i might have expect it let him go off that way without anybodi to watch him  so now i got to go and traps all the way down the river eleven hundr mile and find out what that creetur up to this time as long as i couldnt seem to get ani answer out of you about it whi i never heard noth from you say aunt salli well i wonder  whi i wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by sid be here well i never got em sis aunt polli she turn around slow and sever and say you tom well what he say kind of pettish dont you what me you impud thinghand out them letter what letter them letter  i be bound if i have to take a holt of you ill theyr in the trunk  there now  and theyr just the same as they was when i got them out of the offic  i haint look into them i haint touch them  but i know theyd make troubl and i thought if you warnt in no hurri id well you do need skin there aint no mistak about it  and i wrote anoth one to tell you i was come and i spose he no it come yesterday i haint read it yet but it all right ive got that one i want to offer to bet two dollar she hadnt but i reckon mayb it was just as safe to not to  so i never said noth chapter the last the first time i catch tom privat i ask him what was his idea time of the evasionwhat it was hed plan to do if the evas work all right and he manag to set a nigger free that was alreadi free befor and he said what he had plan in his head from the start if we got jim out all safe was for us to run him down the river on the raft and have adventur plumb to the mouth of the river and then tell him about his be free and take him back up home on a steamboat in style and pay him for his lost time and write word ahead and get out all the nigger around and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight process and a brass band and then he would be a hero and so would we  but i reckon it was about as well the way it was we had jim out of the chain in no time and when aunt polli and uncl sila and aunt salli found out how good he help the doctor nurs tom they made a heap of fuss over him and fix him up prime and give him all he want to eat and a good time and noth to do  and we had him up to the sick room and had a high talk and tom give jim forti dollar for be prison for us so patient and do it up so good and jim was pleas most
