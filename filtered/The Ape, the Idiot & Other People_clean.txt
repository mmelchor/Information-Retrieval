valley crept slowli under the beat heat of a juli sun the dust roll in cloud over the gaudi wagon of the menageri the outer door of the cage had been open to give access of air to the pant anim but with the air came the dust and the dust annoy romulus great never befor had he long for freedom so intens ever sinc he could rememb he had been in a cage like this it had been so all through his childhood and youth there was no trace in his memori of day when he of a time had been free not the faintest recollect exist of the time when he might have swung in the branch of equatori forest to him life was a desol and a despair and the poignanc of it all was sharpen by the cloud of dust which roll through the grate door romulus thereupon sought mean of escap nimbl deft sharp sight he found a weak place in his prison work it open and leap forth upon the highway a free anthropoid ape none of the sleepi weari driver notic his escap and a proper sens of caution caus him to seek secur under a way side shrub until the process had safe pass then the whole world lay befor him his freedom was larg and sweet but for a while perplex an almost instinct leap to catch the trapez bar that had hung in his cage brought his hand in contact with onli unresist air this confus and somewhat frighten him the world seem much broader and brighter sinc the black bar of his prison no longer stripe his vision and then to his amaz in place of the dingi cover of his cage appear a vast and aw expans of blue heaven the tremend depth and distanc of which terrifi him the scamper of a ground squirrel seek it burrow soon caught his notic and he watch the littl anim with great curios then he ran to the burrow and hurt his feet on the sharp wheat stubbl this made him more cautious not find the squirrel he look about and discov two owl sit on a littl mound not far away their solemn gaze fasten upon him inspir him with awe but his curios would not permit him to forego a closer view he cautious crept toward them then he stop sat down and made grotesqu face at them this had no effect he scratch his head and thought then he made a feint as though he would pounc upon them and they flew romulus gaze at them with the greatest amaz for never befor had he seen anyth skim through the air but the world was so wide and freedom so larg that sure everyth free ought to fli so romulus sprang into the air and made motion with his arm like to those the owl had made with their wing and the first grievous disappoint which his freedom brought came when he found himself sprawl on the field his alert mind sought other exercis some distanc away stood a hous and at the front gate was a man and romulus knew man to be the meanest and most cruel of all live thing and the conscienceless taskmast of weaker creatur so romulus avoid the hous and struck out across the field present he came upon a veri larg thing which awe him it was a live oak and the bird were sing in the foliag but his persist curios put a curb upon his fear and he crept closer and closer the kind aspect of the tree the sweet of the shade which it cast the cool depth of it foliag the gentl sway of the bough in the soft north windal invit him to approach this he did until he arriv at the gnarl old bole and then he leap into the branch and was fill with delight the littl bird took flight romulus sat upon a limb and then stretch himself at full length upon it and enjoy the peac and comfort of the moment but he was an ape and had to be employ and so he ran out upon the smaller branch and shook them after the manner of his parent befor him these delight all exploit romulus drop to the ground and began to explor the world again but the world was wide and it loneli oppress him present he saw a dog and made quick for him the dog see the strang creatur approach sought to frighten it by bark but romulus had seen similar anim befor and had heard similar sound he could not be frighten by them he went bold toward the dog by long leap on all four the dog terrifi by the strang look creatur ran away yelp and left romulus with freedom and the world again on went romulus over the field cross a road now and then and keep clear of all live thing that he found present he came to a high picket fenc surround a great inclosur in which sat a larg hous in a grove of eucalyptus tree romulus was thirsti and the play of a fountain among the tree tempt him sore he might have found courag to ventur within had he not at that moment discov a human be not ten feet away on the other side of the fenc romulus sprang back with a cri of terror and then stop and in a crouch attitud readi to fli for his life and freedom gaze at the enemi of all creation but the look he receiv in return was so kind and withal so peculiar and so unlik ani that he had ever seen befor that his instinct to fli yield to his curios to discov romulus did not know that the great hous in the grove was an idiot asylum nor that the lad with the strang but kind express was one of the inmat he knew onli that kind was there the look which he saw was not the hard and cruel one of the menageri keeper nor the empti idl curious one of the spectat countenanc by their presenc and support with their money the infam and exclus human practic of captur wild anim and keep them all their live in the tortur of captiv so deepli interest was romulus in what he saw that he forgot his fear and cock his head on one side and made a queer grimac and his motion and attitud were so comic that mose the idiot grin at him through the picket but the grin was not the onli manifest of pleasur that mose gave a peculiar vermicular movement begin at his feet and end at his head was the precursor of a slow vacant guffaw that express the most intens delight of which he was capabl mose never befor had seen so queer a creatur as this littl brown man all cover with hair he never befor had seen even a monkey that common joy of ordinari childhood and remot from resembl to human kind than was romulus mose was nineteen but although his voic was childlik no longer and his face was cover with unsight short hair and he was larg and strong run most to leg and arm he was simpl and innoc his cloth were much too small and a thick growth of wild hair top his poll otherwis innoc of cover thus gaze these two strang be at each other held by sympathi and curios neither had the power of speech and henc neither could lie to the other was it instinct which made romulus believ that of all the biped devil which infest the face of the earth there was one of so gentl spirit that it could love him and was it by instinct that romulus ignor as he was of the larger way of the world discov that his own mind was the firmer and clever of the two and feel the hitherto unimagin sweet of freedom did there come to him a knowledg that this fellow be was a prison as he himself had been and long for a tast of the open field and if romulus so had reason was it a sens of chivalri or a desir for companionship that led him to the rescu of this one weaker and more unfortun than he he went cautious to the fenc and put through his hand and touch mose the lad much pleas took the hand of the ape in his and at onc there was a good understand between them romulus teas the boy to follow him by go away a few step and look back and then go and pull his hand through the fencedo this repeatedlyuntil his intent work it way into the idiot mind the fenc was too high to be scale but now that the desir for freedom had invad his be mose crush the picket with his huge feet and emerg from his prison these two then were at larg the heaven were lift higher and the horizon was extend at a conveni ditch they slake their thirst and in an orchard they found ripe apricot but what can satisfi the hunger of an ape or an idiot the world was wide and sweet and beauti and the exquisit sens of boundless freedom work like rich old wine in unaccustom vein these all brought infinit delight to romulus and his charg as over the field they went i will not tell particular of all they did that wild mad happi afternoon while drunk and reel with freedom i might say in pass that at one place they tore open the cage of a canari bird swing in a cherri tree out of sight of the hous and at anoth they unbuckl the strap which bound a babi in a cart and might have made off with it but for fear of arrest but these thing have no relat to the climax of their adventur now hasten to accomplish when the sun had sunk lower in the yellow splendor of the west and the great nickel dome of the observatori on mount hamilton had chang from silver to copper the two revel weari and now hungri again came upon a strang and perplex place it was a great oak with it long cone shape shadow point toward the east and the cool depth of it foliag that first attract them about the tree were mound with wooden head board which wiser one would have known the mean of but how could an ape or an idiot know of a freedom so sweet and silent and unencompass and uncondit as death and how could they know that the winner of so rich a prize should be mourn should be wet with tear should be place in the ground with the strut pomp of grief know noth at all of thing like this how could they know that this shabbi buri ground upon which they had stray was so unlik that one which in clear sight some distanc away was order in walk and drive way and ornament with hedg and fountain and statu and rare plant and cost monumentsah my friend how without money may we give adequ express to grief and sure grief without evid of it exist is the idlest of indulg but there was no pomp in the shadow of the oak for the broken fenc set apart this place from the influenc of christian civil enclos grave hold onli such bone as could not rest easi in soil across which was flung the shadow of the cross romulus and mose knew noth of these thing knew noth of law prohibit disinter within two year knew noth of a strang far away peopl from asia who scorn the foreign christian soil upon which they walk despis the civil out of which they wrung money buri their dead in obedi to law which they had not the strength to resist and two year afterward dug up the bone and sent them to the old home to be inter for everlast rest in the soil made and nourish by a god of their own should either romulus or mose judg between these peopl they were in better busi than that their examin of a strang brick furnac in which print prayer were burn and of a low brick altar cover with the greas of use up taper had hard been finish when an approach cloud of dust along the broken fenc warn them to the exercis of caution romulus was the quicker to escap for a circus train make a trail of dust along the road and with swift alacr he sprang into the bough of the oak the heavi mose clamber labori after emit guffaw in prais of the superior agil of his guardian it made mose laugh again to see the littl hairi man stretch himself on a branch and sigh with the luxuri comfort of repos and he near had fallen in tri to imit the nimbl romulus but they were still and silent when the cloud of dust part at a gate gave forth into the enclosur a small cavalcad of carriag and wagon there was a grave newli dug and toward this came the processiona shallow grave for one must not lie too deep in the christian soil of the white barbarianbut it was so small a grave even romulus could have fill it and as for mose it was hard too larg for his feet for littl wang tai was dead and in this small grave were her fragil bone to rest for twenti four month under three feet of christian law interest temper the fright which romulus and mose felt when from the forward carriag came the sound of rasp obo belli less fiddl brazen tom tom and harsh cymbal play a dirg for littl wang tai play less for god protect of her tini soul than for it exempt from the tortur of devil with the other there came forth a littl woman all bent with grief and weep for littl wang tai had a mother and everi mother has a mother heart she was onli a littl yellow woman from asia with queer wide trouser for skirt and rocker sole shoe that flap against her heel her uncov black hair was firm knot and secur pin and her eye were black of color and soft of look and her face like blank in content was wet with tear and drawn with suffer and there sat upon her like a radianc from heaven the sweetest the saddest the deepest the tenderest of all human afflictionsth one and the onli one that time can never heal so they inter littl wang tai and romulus and mose saw it all and paper prayer were burn in the oven and taper were light at the altar and for the refresh of the angel that should come to bear littl wang tai soul to the farther depth of blue heaven some savori viand were spread upon the grave the grave fill the digger hid their spade behind the oven romulus watch them narrowli the littl bent woman gather her grief to her heart and bore it away and a cloud of dust widen away alongsid the broken fenc disappear in the distanc the dome of mount hamilton had chang from copper to gold the purpl canyon of the santa cruz mountain look cold against the blaze orang of the western sky the cricket set up their cheer note in the great old oak and night fell soft as a dream four hungri eye saw the viand of the grave and four greedi nostril inhal the

was a most atroci one his bodi be mutil in a shock manner but in my eye the most signific of all the mutil was the entir remov and disappear of the young princ arm the death of the young man near brought the rajah to the grave it was not therefor until i had nurs him back to health that i began a systemat inquiri into the murder i said noth of my own discoveri and conclus until after the rajah and his offic had fail and my work had been done then i submit to him a written report make a close analysi of all the circumst and close by charg the crime to neranya the rajah convinc by my proof

in the morn he inform me of his decis it was that neranya life should be spare but that both of his leg should be broken with hammer and that then i should amput the limb at the trunk append to this horribl sentenc was a provis that the maim wretch should be kept and tortur at regular interv by such mean as afterward might be devis sicken to the heart by the aw duti set out for me i nevertheless perform it with success and i care to say noth more about that part of the tragedi neranya escap death veri narrowli and was a long time in recov his wont vital dure all these week the rajah neither saw him nor made inquiri concern him but when as in duti bound i made offici report that the man had recov his strength the rajah eye brighten and he emerg with dead activ from the stupor into which he so long had been plung the rajah palac was a nobl structur but it is necessari here to describ onli the grand hall it was an immens chamber with a floor of polish inlaid stone and a lofti arch ceil a soft light stole into it through stain glass set in the roof and in high window on one side in the middl of the room was a rich fountain which threw up a tall slender column of water with smaller and shorter jet group around it across one end of the hall half way to the ceil was a balconi which communic with the upper stori of a wing and from which a flight of stone stair descend to the floor of the hall dure the hot summer this room was delight cool it was the rajah favorit loung place and when the night were hot he had his cot taken thither and there he slept this hall was chosen for neranya perman prison here was he to stay so long as he might live with never a glimps of the shine world or the glorious heaven to one of his nervous discont natur such confin was wors than death at the rajah order there was construct for him a small pen of open iron work circular and about four feet in diamet elev on four slender iron post ten feet abov the floor and place between the balconi and the fountain such was neranya prison the pen was about four feet in depth and the pen top was left open for the conveni of the servant whose duti it should be to care for him these precaut for his safe confin were taken at my suggest for although the man was now depriv of all four of his limb i still fear that he might develop some extraordinari unheard of power for mischief it was provid that the attend should reach his cage by mean of a movabl ladder all these arrang have been made and neranya hoist into his cage the rajah emerg upon the balconi to see him for the first time sinc the last amput neranya had been lie pant and helpless on the floor of his cage but when his quick ear caught the sound of the rajah footfal he squirm about until he had brought the back of his head against the rail elev his eye abov his chest and enabl him to peer through the open work of the cage thus the two dead enemi face each other the rajah stern face pale at sight of the hideous shapeless thing which met his gaze but he soon recov and the old hard cruel sinist look return neranya black hair and beard had grown long and they ad to the natur feroc of his aspect his eye blaze upon the rajah with a terribl light his lip part and he gasp for breath his face was ashen with rage and despair and his thin distend nostril quiver the rajah fold his arm and gaze down from the balconi upon the fright wreck that he had made oh the dread patho of that pictur the inhuman of it the deep and dismal tragedi of it who might look into the wild despair heart of the prison and see and understand the fright turmoil there the surg choke passion unbridl but impot feroc frantic thirst for a vengeanc that should be deeper than hell neranya gaze his shapeless bodi heav his eye aflam and then in a strong clear voic which rang throughout the great hall with rapid speech he hurl at the rajah the most insult defianc the most aw curs he curs the womb that had conceiv him the food that should nourish him the wealth that had brought him power curs him in the name of buddha and all the wise men curs by the sun the moon and the star by the contin mountain ocean and river by all thing live curs his head his heart his entrail curs in a whirlwind of unmention word heap unimagin insult and contum upon him call him a knave a beast a fool a liar an infam and unspeak coward the rajah heard it all calm without the movement of a muscl without the slightest chang of counten and when the poor wretch had exhaust his strength and fallen helpless and silent to the floor the rajah with a grim cold smile turn and strode away the day pass the rajah not deter by neranya curs often heap upon him spent even more time than former in the great hall and slept there often at night and final neranya weari of curs and defi him and fell into a sullen silenc the man was a studi for me and i observ everi chang in his fleet mood general his condit was that of miser despair which he attempt brave to conceal even the boon of suicid had been deni him for when he would wriggl into an erect posit the rail of his pen was a foot abov his head so that he could not clamber over and break his skull on the stone floor beneath and when he had tri to starv himself the attend forc food down his throat so that he abandon such attempt at time his eye would blaze and his breath would come in gasp for imaginari vengeanc was work within him but steadili he becam quieter and more tractabl and was pleasant and respons when i would convers with him whatev might have been the tortur which the rajah had decid on none as yet had been order and although neranya knew that they were in contempl he never refer to them or complain of his lot the aw climax of this situat was reach one night and even after this laps of year i cannot approach it descript without a shudder it was a hot night and the rajah had gone to sleep in the great hall lie on a high cot place on the main floor just underneath the edg of the balconi i had been unabl to sleep in my own apart and so i had stolen into the great hall through the heavili curtain entranc at the end farthest from the balconi as i enter i heard a peculiar soft sound abov the patter of the fountain neranya cage was part conceal from my view by the spray water but i suspect that the unusu sound came from him steal a littl to one side and crouch against the dark hang of the wall i could see him in the faint light which dim illumin the hall and then i discov that my surmis was correctneranya was quiet at work curious to learn more and know that onli mischief could have been inspir him i sank into a thick robe on the floor and watch him to my great astonish neranya was tear off with his teeth the bag which serv as his outer garment he did it cautious cast sharp glanc frequent at the rajah who sleep sound on his cot below breath heavili after start a strip with his teeth neranya by the same mean would attach it to the rail of his cage and then wriggl away much after the manner of a caterpillar crawl and this would caus the strip to be torn out the full length of his garment he repeat this oper with incred patienc and skill until his entir garment had been torn into strip two or three of these he tie end to end with his teeth lip and tongu tighten the knot by place one end of the strip under his bodi and draw the other taut with his teeth in this way he made a line sever feet long one end of which he made fast to the rail with his mouth it then began to dawn upon me that he was go to make an insan attemptimposs of achiev without hand feet arm or legsto escap from his cage for what purpos the rajah was asleep in the hallah i caught my breath oh the desper insan thirst for reveng which could have unhing so clear and firm a mind even though he should accomplish the imposs feat of climb over the rail of his cage that he might fall to the floor below for how could he slide down the rope he would be in all probabl kill or stun and even if he should escap these danger it would be imposs for him to clamber upon the cot without rous the rajah and imposs even though the rajah were dead amaz at the man dare and convinc that his suffer and brood had destroy his reason nevertheless i watch him with breathless interest with other strip tie togeth he made a short swing across one side of his cage he caught the long line in his teeth at a point not far from the rail then wriggl with great effort to an upright posit his back brace against the rail he put his chin over the swing and work toward one end he tighten the grasp of his chin on the swing and with tremend exert work the lower end of his spine against the rail he began gradual to ascend the side of his cage the labor was so great that he was compel to paus at interv and his breath was hard and pain and even while thus rest he was in a posit of terribl strain and his push against the swing caus it to press hard against his windpip and near strangl him after amaz effort he had elev the lower end of his bodi until it protrud abov the rail the top of which was now across the lower end of his abdomen gradual he work his bodi over go backward until there was suffici excess of weight on the outer side of the rail and then with a quick lurch he rais his head and shoulder and swung into a horizont posit on top of the rail of cours he would have fallen to the floor below had it not been for the line which he held in his teeth with so great niceti had he estim the distanc between his mouth and the point where the rope was fasten to the rail that the line tighten and check him just as he reach the horizont posit on the rail if one had told me beforehand that such a feat as i had just seen this man accomplish was possibl i should have thought him a fool neranya was now balanc on his stomach across the top of the rail and he eas his posit by bend his spine and hang down on either side as much as possibl have rest thus for some minut he began cautious to slide off backward slowli pay out the line through his teeth find almost a fatal difficulti in pass the knot now it is quit possibl that the line would have escap altogeth from his teeth later when he would slight relax his hold to let it slip had it not been for a veri ingeni plan to which he had resort this consist in his have made a turn of the line around his neck befor he attack the swing thus secur a threefold control of the lineon by his teeth anoth by friction against his neck and a third by his abil to compress it between his cheek and shoulder it was quit evid now that the minutest detail of a most elabor plan had been care work out by him befor begin the task and that possibl week of difficult theoret studi had been consum in the mental prepar as i observ him i was remind of certain hitherto unaccount thing which he had been do for some week pastgo through certain hitherto inexplic motion undoubt for the purpos of train his muscl for the immeasur arduous labor which he was now perform a stupend and seem imposs part of his task had been accomplish could he reach the floor in safeti gradual he work himself backward over the rail in immin danger of fall but his nerv never waver and i could see a wonder light in his eye with someth of a lurch his bodi fell against the outer side of the rail to which he was hang by his chin the line still held firm in his teeth slowli he slip his chin from the rail and then hung suspend by the line in his teeth by almost impercept degre with infinit caution he descend the line and final his unwieldi bodi roll upon the floor safe and unhurt what miracl would this superhuman monster next accomplish i was quick and strong and was readi and abl to intercept ani danger act but not until danger appear would i interfer with this extraordinari scene i must confess to astonish upon have observ that neranya instead of proceed direct toward the sleep rajah took quit anoth direct then it was onli escap after all that the wretch contempl and not the murder of the rajah but how could he escap the onli possibl way to reach the outer air without great risk was by ascend the stair to the balconi and leav by the corridor which open upon it and thus fall into the hand of some british soldier quarter thereabout who might conceiv the idea of hide him but sure it was imposs for neranya to ascend that long flight of stair nevertheless he made direct for them his method of progress this he lay upon his back with the lower end of his bodi toward the stair then bow his spine upward thus draw his head and shoulder a littl forward straighten and then push the lower end of his bodi forward a space equal to that through which he had drawn his head repeat this again and again each time while bend his spine prevent his head from slip by press it against the floor his progress was labori and slow but sensibl and final he arriv at the foot of the stair it was manifest that his insan purpos was to ascend them the desir for freedom must have been strong within him wriggl to an upright posit against the newel post he look up at the great height which he had to climb and sigh but there was no dim of the light in his eye how could he accomplish the imposs task his solut of the problem was veri simpl though dare and peril as all the rest while lean against the newel post he let himself fall diagon upon the bottom step where he lay part hang over but safe on his side turn upon his back he wriggl forward along the step to the rail and rais himself to an upright posit against it as he had against the newel post fell as befor and land on the second step in this manner with inconceiv labor he accomplish the ascent of the entir flight of stair it be appar to me that the rajah was not the object of neranya movement the anxieti which i had felt on that account was now entir dissip the thing which alreadi he had accomplish were entir beyond the nimblest imagin the sympathi which i had alway felt for the wretch man was now great quicken and as infinitesim small as i knew his chanc for escap to be i nevertheless hope that he would succeed ani assist from me howev was out of the question and it never should be known that i had wit the escap neranya was now upon the balconi and i could dim see him wriggl along toward the door which led out upon the balconi final he stop and wriggl to an upright posit against the rail which had wide open between the balust his back was toward me but he slowli turn and face me and the hall at that great distanc i could not distinguish his featur but the slow with which he had work even befor he had fulli accomplish the ascent of the stair was evid all too eloqu of his extrem exhaust noth but a most desper resolut could have sustain him thus far but he had drawn upon the last remnant of his strength he look around the hall with a sweep glanc and then down upon the rajah who was sleep immedi beneath him over twenti feet below he look long and earnest sink lower and lower and lower upon the rail sudden to my inconceiv astonish and dismay he toppl through and shot downward from his lofti height i held my breath expect to see him crush upon the stone floor beneath but instead of that he fell full upon the rajah breast drive him through the cot to the floor i sprang forward with a loud cri for help and was instant at the scene of the catastroph with indescrib horror i saw that neranya teeth were buri in the rajah throat i tore the wretch away but the blood was pour from the rajah arteri his chest was crush in and he was gasp in the agoni of death peopl came run in terrifi i turn to neranya he lay upon his back his face hideous smear with blood murder and not escap had been his intent from the begin and he had employ the onli method by which there was ever a possibl of accomplish it i knelt besid him and saw that he too was die his back had been broken by the fall he smile sweet into my face and a triumphant look of accomplish reveng sat upon his face even in death the perman stiletto i had sent in all hast for dr rowel but as yet he had not arriv and the strain was terribl there lay my young friend upon his bed in the hotel and i believ that he was die onli the jewel handl of the knife was visibl at his breast the blade was wholli sheath in his bodi pull it out old fellow beg the suffer through white drawn lip his gasp voic be hard less distress than the unearth look in his eye no arnold said i as i held his hand and gentl stroke his forehead it may have been instinct it may have been a certain knowledg of anatomi that made me

two men enter the room there was someth of nerv and assur in the young surgeon that struck my attent his manner though quiet was bold and straightforward and his movement sure and quick this young man had alreadi distinguish himself in the perform of some difficult hospit laparotomi and he was at that sanguin age when ambit look through the spectacl of experi dr raoul entrefort was the new comer name he was a creol small and dark and he had travel and studi in europ speak freeli gasp arnold after dr entrefort had made an examin what think you doctor ask entrefort of the older man i think was the repli that the knife blade has penetr the ascend aorta about two inch abov the heart so long as the blade remain in the wound the escap of blood is compar small though certain were the blade withdrawn the heart would almost instant empti itself through the aortal wound meanwhil entrefort was deft cut away the white shirt and the undershirt and soon had the breast expos he examin the gem stud hilt with the keenest interest you are proceed on the assumpt doctor he said that this weapon is a knife certain answer dr rowel smile what els can it be it is a knife faint interpos arnold did you see the blade entrefort ask him quick i didfor a moment entrefort shot a quick look at dr rowel and whisper then it is not suicid dr rowel look puzzl and said noth i must disagre with you gentlemen quiet remark entrefort this is not a knife he examin the handl veri narrowli not onli was the blade entir conceal from view within arnold bodi but the blow had been so strong deliv that the skin was depress by the guard the fact that it is not a knife present a veri curious seri of fact and conting pursu entrefort with amaz cool some of which are so far as i am inform entir novel in the histori of surgeri a quizzic express faint amus and manifest interest was upon dr rowel face what is the weapon doctor he ask a stiletto arnold start dr rowel appear confus i must confess he said my ignor of the differ among these penetr weapon whether dirk dagger stiletto poniard or bowi knive with the except of the stiletto explain entrefort all the weapon you mention have one or two edg so that in penetr they cut their way a stiletto is round is ordinarili about half an inch or less in diamet at the guard and taper to a sharp point it penetr sole by push the tissu asid in all direct you will understand the import of that point dr rowel nod more deepli interest than ever how do you know it is a stiletto dr entrefort i ask the cut of these stone is the work of italian lapidari he said and they were set in genoa notic too the guard it is much broader and shorter than the guard of an edg weapon in fact it is near round this weapon is about four hundr year old and would be cheap at twenti thousand florin observ also the darken color of your friend breast in the immedi vicin of the guard this indic that the tissu have been bruis by the crowd of the blade if i may use the term what has all this to do with me ask the die man perhap a great deal perhap noth it bring a singl ray of hope into your desper condit arnold eye sparkl and he caught his breath a tremor pass all through him and i felt it in the hand i was hold life was sweet to him then after allsweet to this wild dare devil who had just face death with such calm dr rowel though show no sign of jealousi could not conceal a look of incredul with your permiss said entrefort address arnold i will do what i can to save your life you may said the poor boy but i shall have to hurt you well perhap veri much well and even if i succeed the chanc is one in a thousand you will never be a sound man and a constant and terribl danger will alway be present well entrefort wrote a note and sent it away in hast by a bell boy meanwhil he resum your life is in immin danger from shock and the end may come in a few minut or hour from that caus attend without delay to whatev matter may requir settl and dr rowel glanc at that gentleman will give you someth to brace you up i speak frank for i see that you are a man of extraordinari nerv am i right be perfect candid said arnold dr rowel evid bewild by his cyclon young associ wrote a prescript which i sent by a boy to be fill with unwis zeal i ask entrefort is there not danger of lockjaw no he repli there is not a suffici extens injuri to peripher nerv to induc traumat tetanus i subsid dr rowel medicin came and i administ a dose the physician and the surgeon then retir the poor suffer straighten up his busi when it was done he ask me what is that crazi frenchman go to do to me i have no idea be patient in less than an hour they return bring with them a keen eye tall young man who had a number of tool wrap in an apron evid he was unus to such scene for he becam death pale upon see the ghast spectacl on my bed with stare eye and open mouth he began to retreat toward the door stammer ii cant do it nonsens hippolyt dont be a babi whi man it is a case of life and death butlook at his eye he is die arnold smile i am not dead though he gasp ii beg your pardon said hippolyt dr entrefort gave the nervous man a drink of brandi and then said no more nonsens my boy it must be done gentlemen allow me to introduc mr hippolyt one of the most origin ingeni and skil machinist in the countri hippolyt be modest blush as he bow in order to conceal his confus he unrol his apron on the tabl with consider nois of rattl tool i have to make some prepar befor you may begin hippolyt and i want you to observ me that you may becom use not onli to the sight of fresh blood but also what is more tri the odor of it hippolyt shiver entrefort open a case of surgic instrument now doctor the chloroform he said to dr rowel i will not take it prompt interpos the suffer i want to know when i die veri well said entrefort but you have littl nerv now to spare we may tri it without chloroform howev it will be better if you can do without tri your best to lie still while i cut what are you go to do ask arnold save your life if possibl how tell me all about it must you know yes veri well then the point of the stiletto has pass entir through the aorta which is the great vessel rise out of the heart and carri the aerat blood to the arteri if i should withdraw the weapon the blood would rush from the two hole in the aorta and you would soon be dead if the weapon had been a knife the part tissu would have yield and the blood would have been forc out on either side of the blade and would have caus death as it is not a drop of blood has escap from the aorta into the thorac caviti all that is left for us to do then is to allow the stiletto to remain perman in the aorta mani difficulti at onc present themselv and i do not wonder at dr rowel look of surpris and incredul that gentleman smile and shook his head it is a desper chanc continu entrefort and is a novel case in surgeri but it is the onli chanc the fact that the weapon is a stiletto is the import pointa stupid weapon but a bless to us now if the assassin had known more she would have use upon his employ of the noun assassin and the feminin pronoun she both arnold and i start violent and i cri out to the man to stop let him proceed said arnold who by a remark effort had calm himself not if the subject is pain entrefort said it is not protest arnold whi do you think the blow was struck by a woman becaus first no man capabl of be an assassin would use so gaudi and valuabl a weapon second no man would be so stupid as to carri so antiqu and inadequ a thing as a stiletto when that most murder and satisfactori of all penetr and cut weapon the bowi knife is avail she was a strong woman too for it requir a good hand to drive a stiletto to the guard even though it miss the sternum by a hair breadth and slip between the rib for the muscl here are hard and the intercost space narrow she was not onli a strong woman but a desper one also that will do said arnold he beckon me to bend closer you must watch this man he is too sharp he is danger then resum entrefort i shall tell you what i intend to do there will undoubt be inflamm of the aorta which if it persist will caus a fatal aneur by a break down of the aortal wall but we hope with the help of your youth and health to check it anoth serious difficulti is this with everi inhal the entir thorax or boni structur of the chest consider expand the aorta remain stationari you will see therefor that as your aorta and your breast are now held in rigid relat to each other by the stiletto the chest with everi inhal pull the aorta forward out of place about half an inch i am certain that it is do this becaus there is no indic of an escap of arteri blood into the thorac caviti in other word the mouth of the two aortal wound have seiz upon the blade with a firm hold and thus prevent it from slip in and out this is a veri fortun occurr but one which will caus pain for some time the aorta you may understand be made by the stiletto to move with the breath pull the heart backward and forward with everi breath you take but that organ though now undoubt much surpris will accustom itself to it new condit what i fear most howev is the format of a clot around the blade you see the presenc of the blade in the aorta has alreadi reduc the blood carri capac of that vessel a clot therefor need not be veri larg to stop up the aorta and of cours if that should occur death would ensu but the clot if one form may be dislodg and driven forward in which event it may lodg in ani one of the numer branch from the aorta and produc result more or less serious possibl fatal if for instanc it should choke either the right or the left carotid there would ensu atrophi of one side of the brain and consequ paralysi of half the entir bodi but it is possibl that in time there would come about a secondari circul from the other side of the brain and thus restor a healthi condit or the clot which in pass alway from larger arteri to smaller must unavoid find one not suffici larg to carri it and must lodg somewher may either necessit amput of one of the four limb or lodg itself so deep within the bodi that it cannot be reach with

that would let out the blood and caus death i am uncertain whether the hold is now maintain by the pressur of the tissu or the adhes qualiti of the serum which was set free by the punctur i am convinc though that in either event the hold is easili broken and that it may give way at ani moment for it is under sever kind of strain everi time the heart contract and crowd the blood into the aorta the latter expand a littl and then contract when the pressur is remov ani unusu exercis or excit produc stronger and quicker heart beat and increas the strain on the adhes of the aorta to the weapon a

of his figur without a singl chang in the pitch or modul of his voic never hurri but speak with the slow and dreari monotoni with which he had begun he neverthelesspart by reason of these evid of his incred self controlmad a formid pictur as he proceed when i told him that sir he said hed take me to the ladder and see if he couldnt make me chang my mind yes sir he said hed take me to the ladder here there was a long paus and i a human be with flesh on my bone and the heart of a man in my bodi the other warden hadnt tri to break my spirit on the ladder he did break it though he broke it clear to the bottom of the man insid of me but he did it with a human word and not with the dungeon and the ladder i didnt believ the warden when he said he would take me to the ladder i couldnt imagin myself aliv and put through at the ladder and i couldnt imagin ani human be who could find the heart to put me through if i had believ him i would have strangl him then and there and got my bodi full

of his point finger the steadi gleam of his eye or the slow monotoni of his speech i had never wit ani scene so dramat as this and yet all was absolut simpl and unintent i had been thrill by the greatest actor as with matchless skill they gave rein to their genius in tragic situat but how inconceiv tawdri and cheap such pictur seem in comparison with this the claptrap of the music the light the pose the wri face the gasp lung stagger roll eyeshow flimsi and colorless how mock and grotesqu they all appear besid this simpl uncouth but genuin express of immeasur agoni the stenograph held his pencil pois abov the paper and wrote no more and then the whip came down across my back the someth insid of me twist hard and then broke wide open and went pour all through me like melt iron it was a hard fight to keep my head clear but i did it and then i said to the warden this youv struck me with a whip in cold blood youv tie me up hand and foot to whip me like a dog well whip me then till you fill your belli with it you are a coward you are lower and meaner and cowardli than the lowest and meanest dog that ever yelp when his master kick him you were born a coward coward will lie and steal and you are the same as a thief and liar no hound would own you for a friend whip me hard and long you coward whip me i say see how good a coward feel when he tie up a man and whip him like a dog whip me till the last breath quit my bodi if you leav me aliv i will kill you for this his face got white he ask me if i meant that and i said yes befor god i do then he took the whip in both

besid me feel my puls the prison had finish he look around vagu as though he want to go and you have been in the dungeon ever sinc yes sir but i dont mind that how long twenti three month on bread and water yes but that was all i want have you reflect that so long as you harbor a determin to kill the warden you may be kept in the dungeon you cant live much longer there and if you die there you will never find the chanc you want if you say you will not kill the warden he may return you to the cell but that would be a lie sir i will get a chanc to kill him if i go to the cell i would rather die in the dungeon than be a liar and sneak if you send me to the cell i will kill him but i will kill him without that i will kill him sir and he know it without conceal but open deliber and implac thus in

after all it would be far sweeter reveng to let her live bear through life a brand of infami that would be much better she would lose her high posit and the respect of her friend the newspap would publish her shame to the world point her out by name as the deprav woman who had betray her husband and driven him to murder and suicid they would have her portrait in their column her name and crime would be hawk upon the street by loud cri news boy sermon denounc her would be preach in all the church her shame would be discuss everywherein home shop hotel and bar room in mani citi not onli that but she would be strip of all the properti which she had enjoy so much she would be turn adrift upon the street for no one would help her none have a kind word for her none give her even the respect which money might command be thus turn out upon the world all friendless and alon and be natur deprav she would seek the protect of fast and shadi men thus start and soon take to drink as such women alway do down she would plung into a reckless and shameless career sink lower and lower lose her beauti becom coars loud and vulgar then arriv at that stage when her beauti no longer could be a sourc

as low final one night brought shriek with delirium tremen to the polic station bundl out to the hospit strap firm to an iron bed and then die with foul oath on her lipssuch a life would be infinit wors than death such reveng immeasur vaster than that of the pistol then it was final decid that she must live and suffer as to the frienda to stockton the betray the sneak the coward he should die like a dog that decis could not be reconsid he should not be grant the privileg of a duel for not onli was he wholli undeserv of such consider but by such mean his life might be spare undoubt she love him perhap he love her he live and the husband kill in a duel their satisfact would be doubledhav wreck and humili him and driven him to despair they then kill him after that they could enjoy each

foul stain on his name these thing be settl the wretch man reread the will as the woman was to live she must be mention in the document he tore up the will and wrote anoth in which he bequeath her one dollar set forth her shame as the reason for so small a bequest then he wrote out a separ statement of the whole affair seal it address it to the coron and place it in his pocket it would be found there after awhil well whi this trembl in everi member this unaccount nausea this unconquer feel of horror and repugn as the draft of the pictur was contempl did instinct aris and dumbl plead for merci what merci had been shown that merci could be expect none whatev there was not onli reveng to be satisfi but justic also still it was horribl admit that she deserv it all deserv even more she was a woman no act of her could depriv her of her natur claim upon the stronger sex as a woman she had inalien right which even she could not forfeit which men may not withhold and then where could be the benefit of ad physic suffer to mental one sure would weaken the forc of the other the lower she should fall and the deeper her degrad the smaller would becom the effici of her mental agoni and yet mental suffer was the kind which it was desir should fall upon her it would be well therefor to leav her some moneya consider amount of moneyin order that hold herself abov the want which in her case would lead to degrad and a blunt of the sensibl she might suffer all the more keen in order that the memori of her shame might be forev poignant forev a caus for the sharpest regret this would be better in other way her shame publish she could never associ with those fine charact who had been her friend her lover dead and his memori disgrac he could not be present to consol her for societi she would have onli those whom her fortun would attract and they were not of a kind to satisfi such a woman as she she would alway be within sight of the old life and it pleasur but just beyond the palesuffici near to see and long for but too far to reach and forev kept back by the cold glanc of contempt and disdain from the high circl in which she had been rear therefor it were better to leav her the bulk of his fortun so he tore up the second will and wrote a third in which while name her as his princip legate he incorpor the stori of her shame he felt better now than at ani other time sinc his discoveri he walk about the room look out the window then fell into his chair again how strang alik in mani respect are all anim includ man he thought there are qualiti and passion common to them allhat fear anger reveng love fond for offspr in what is man superior to the other manifest in self control a sens of justic the attribut of merci the qualiti of chariti the power to forgiv the

approach more close to the lower order to the degre that the passion common to all have masteri over him doe he lack the finer qualiti which distinguish his speci the desir to kill when hurt anger or threaten is the stronger the lower we descend in the scale of the ordersth lower we descend even among the member of the same order the least develop men are the most brutal reveng is the malic of anger it is strang that his thought should have taken such a turn and then the fundament instinct which guard the perpetu of the speci is common to all and it manifest are control by a univers law whose simpl variat do not impair it integr love and matingthes are the broad line upon which the perpetu of the speci start what possibl abstract are there in them is not their charact concret and visibl whatev fine sentiment are evolv we know their sourc and comprehend their function there is no mysteri here what is this jealousi which all anim may have it is an instinct resent by one of a mate pair of someth which interfer with a pleasant establish system the basi of which is perpetu of the speci higher mankind has the abil to dissect it analyz it understand it and guard against it harm oper herein lie distinguish qualiti of superior if when his jealousi is rous he is unabl to act ani differ from the lion the hors or the dog then in that regard he is not superior to them man be an eater of meat is a savag anim like the dog the tiger the panther the lion his passion are strong as are their but he has qualiti which enabl him to hold them in check if an anim have a strong

left for man the noblest of the anim the other are content to kill the seduc what thank there is for escap from an act so recent contempl which would have place it perpetr below the level of the most savag of the brute in what of all that was now propos to be done was there ani qualiti to distinguish the act from those of the most savag brute except a more elabor detail the work of superior malic and feroc is it a wonder that randolph shudder when he thought of it the broadest characterist of all anim includ man is selfish in man it reach it highest form and becom vaniti pride and a ridicul sens of self import but man alon is conscious of it exist charact and purpos he alon encourag it ration develop and suppress the most evil of it abus the anim which would fight or kill from jealousi is move by a selfish motiv onli it proceed to satisfi it anger or gratifi it reveng without ani regard to the ethic without ani thought of it oblig to natur without the slightest wish to inquir

and then advanc in the light of wisdom if not he is no better in this regard than the anim which cannot so reason and understand this manner of think was bring the unhappi man closer to himself then have face the proposit that he had been consid his own case all along he found the situat to be somewhat like this he had a certain understand which should oper to remov him from influenc which with men of inferior concept would be more power not be a brute he should rise abov impuls which a brute is constrain by it natur to obey so much was clear then what should he do he ponder this long and serious was it possibl to wipe out the past with exposur humili shame and blood he had been proud of her he had love her he had been veri veri happi with her she had been his inspir a part of his hope

did nobler work with the ocean and the cypress send the one upon a riotous cours and rend the other with groan i arriv upon a cliff just beyond a pebbl beach and with bare head and my waistcoat open stood face the ocean and the storm it was not a cold night though a winter storm was at larg but it was a night of blind agoni and struggl in which a mad wind lash the sea and a madden sea assail the shore while a fli rain and a drench spray dim the sombr color of the scene it was a night for the sea to talk in it travail and yield up some of it mysteri i left the cliff and went a littl distanc to the neighborhood of a chines fish station where there was a sand beach and here after throw off my coat and waistcoat i went down to have a closer touch with my treacher friend the surf sprang at me and the wave retreat gentl beckon me to further ventur which i made with a knowledg of my ground but with a love of this sweet danger also a strong breaker lift me from my foot but i outwit it and pursu it in retreat there came anoth afterward and it was arm for tower abov me it came down upon me with a bludgeon which fell heavili upon me i seiz it but there my command upon my power ceas and the wave return bore me out a blind a vagu sens of suffoc an uncertain effort of instinct to regain my hold upon the ground a flight through the air a soft fall upon the sandit was thus that i was save and i still held in my hand the weapon with which my old friend had dealt me the blow it was a bottl afterward in my room at monterey i broke it and found within it a write of uncommon interest after week of studi and deciph for age and imperfect execut made the task serious and the result uncertain i put togeth such fragment of it as had the semblanc of coher and i found that the sea in it travail had yield up one of it strangest mysteri no hope of a profit answer to this earnest cri for help prompt it public it is brought forth rather to show a novel and fear form of human suffer and also to give knowledg possibl to some who if they be yet aliv would rather know the worst than noth the follow is what my labor has accomplish i am amasa d keat an unhappi wretch who with mani other

we expect noth but death i will hasten to the materi part of my narrat with the relat onli of so much of the begin as may serv for our identif on the 14th of octob 1852 we sail from boston in the brig hopewel captain campbel bound for the island of the south pacif ocean we carri a cargo of general merchandis with the purpos of trade with the nativ but we desir also to find some suitabl island which we might take possess of in the name of the unit state and settl upon for our perman home with this end in view we had form a compani and bought the brig so that it might remain our properti and be use as a mean of communic between us and the civil world these fact and mani other are so familiar to our friend in boston that i deem it wholli unnecessari to set them forth in fuller detail the name of all our passeng and crew stand upon record in boston and are not need to be written here for ampler identif no ill fortun assail us until we arriv in the neighborhood of the falkland island cape horn wore it ugliest aspect for the brig was a slow sailer and the antarct summer was well gone befor we had encount bad weatheran unusu thing captain campbel assur us from that time forward we had a seri of misfortun which end final after two or three month in a fear gale which not onli cost some of the crew their live but dismast our vessel the storm continu and the brig be wholli at the merci of the wind and the sea we saw that she must founder we therefor took to the boat with what provis and other necessari thing we could stow away with no land in sight and in the midst of a boil sea which appear everi moment to be on the eve of swamp us we bent to our oar and head for the northwest it is hard necessari to say that we had lost our reckon but after a manner we made out that we were near in longitud 13630 west and about upon the tropic of capricorn this would have made our situat about a hundr and seventi mile from a number of small island lie to the eastward of the one hundr and fortieth meridian the prospect was discourag as there was hard a sound person in the boat to pull an oar so bad had the weather use us and besid that the ship instrument had been lost and our provis were bad damag nevertheless we made some headway the poor abandon brig seem conscious of our desert behav in a veri singular fashion urg doubtless by the wind she pursu us with pathet strugglesnow beam on again stern foremost and still again plung forward with her nose under the water her pitch and lurch were strain her heavili and with her hold full of water she evid could live but a few minut longer meanwhil it was no small matter for us to keep clear of her for whether we would pull to this side or that she follow us and sometim we were in danger there came an end howev for the brig now heavili water log rose majest on a great wave and came down side on into the trough she made a brave struggl to right herself but in anoth moment she went over upon her beam settl steadi herself a moment and then sank straight down like a mass of lead this brought upon us a peculiar sens of desol for so far as we knew and captain campbel had sail these sea befor there was hard a chanc of our gain land aliv much to our surpris we had not row more than twenti knot when it be about midnight a fire was sight off our port bowthat is to say due west this gave us so great courag that we row heartili toward it and at three in the morn to our unspeak happi we drag our boat upon a beauti sand beach so exhaust were we that with small loss of time we made ourselv comfort and soon were sound asleep upon firm ground the next sun had done more than half it work befor ani of us were awak except some bird of live plumag there was not a live thing in sight but no sooner had we begun to stir about than a number of fine brown men approach us simultan from differ direct a belt was around their waist and from it hung a short garment made of bark woven into a coars fabric and also hang from the belt was a heavi sword of metal undoubt the men were savag but there was a digniti in their manner which set them wholli apart from the known inhabit of these south sea island our captain who understood mani of the languag and dialect of the sub tropic island found himself at fault in attempt verbal intercours with these visitor but it was not long befor we found them exceed apt in understand sign they show much commiser for us and with manifest of friendship invit us to follow them and test their hospit this we were not slow in do the islandw were made to know on the waywa a journey of ten hour long and seven wide and our eye gave us proof of it wonder fecund of soil for there were great banana plantat and other of curious kind of grain the narrow of the road convinc us that there were no wagon or beast of burden but there were mani evid of a civil which for these part was of extraordinari develop such for instanc as fine cultiv field and good hous of stone with such evid of an aesthet tast as found express in the domest cultiv of mani of the beauti flower which grew upon the island these matter i mention with some particular in order that the island may be recogn by the rescuer for whom we are eager pray the town to which we were led is a place of singular beauti while there is no order arrang of street the hous be scatter about confus there is a larg sens of comfort and room and a fine charact of neat the build are all of rough stone and are not divid into apart the window and door are hung with mat give testimoni of an absenc of thiev a littl to one side upon a knoll is the hous of the king or chief it is much like the other except that it is larger a chamber in front serv as an execut room where the king dispos of the busi of his rulership into this audienc room we were led and present the king himself appear he was dress with more barbar profus than his subject about his neck and in his ear were mani fine piec of jewelri of gold and silver evid the work of european artisan but worn with a complet disregard of their origin purpos the king a larg strong and handsom man receiv us with a kind smile if ever a human face show kind of heart it was his he had us to understand at onc that we were most welcom that he sympath with us in our distress and that all our want should be attend to until mean should be found for restor us to our countri or send us whithersoev els we might desir to go it was not at all like he said for he spoke german a littl that ani vessel from the outsid world would ever visit the island as it appear to be unknown to navig and it was a law upon the island that the inhabit of no other island should approach at certain time of the moon howev he sent a boat to an island mani leagu away to bear some rare product of his peopl in exchang for other commod and should we so desir we might be taken one at a time in the boat and thus eventu be put in the way of pass vessel with what appear to be an embarrass hesit he inform us that he was compel to impos a certain mild restraint upon uson which he hurri to add would in no way interfer with our comfort or pleasur this was that we be kept apart from his peopl as they were simpl and happi and he fear that associ with us would bring discont among them their present condit had come about sole through the polici of complet isol which had been follow in the past we receiv this communic with a delight which we took no pain to conceal and the king seem touch by our express of gratitud so in a littl while we were establish as a coloni about three mile from the town the quick hand of the nativ have made for us out of pole mat and thatch a suffici number of hous for our comfort and the king place at our dispos a larg acreag for our use if we should desir to help ourselv with farm for which purpos an intellig nativ was sent to instruct us it was on the 10th day of may 1853 that we went upon the island and the 14th when we went into coloni i cannot paus to give ani further descript of this beauti island and our delight surround but must hasten away to a relat of the terribl thing which present befel us we had been upon the island about a month when the king who had been to visit us twice sent a messeng to say that a boat would leav on the morrow and that if ani one of us wish to go he could be taken the messeng said that the king best judgment was that the sick one ought to go first as in the event of serious ill it would be better that they should die at home we overlook this singular and savag way of state the case for our sens of gratitud to the king was so great that the express of a slight wish from him was as bind upon us as law henc from our number we select john foley a carpent of boston as the hardship of the voyag had develop in him a quick consumpt and he had no famili or relat in the coloni as mani other of us had the poor fellow was overcom with gratitud and he left us the happiest man i ever saw i must now mention a veri singular thing which upon the departur of foley was given a conspicu place in our attent we were in a roomi valley which was near surround by perpendicular wall of great height and from no access point was the sea visibl on sever occas some of the younger men had sought to leav the valley for the shore but at each attempt the nativ guard set over us had sudden appear at the few pass which natur had left in the wall and kind but firm had turn our young men back say that it was the king wish we should not leav the valley the older head among us discourag these attempt to escap hold them to be breach of faith and hospit but the knowledg of be absolut prison weigh upon us nevertheless and becam more and more irksom when therefor our companion was taken away an organ movement was made among the young men to gain an elev posit command a view of the sea in order to observ the direct taken by foley boat the plan was to divid into bodi and move simultan in forc upon all the point of egress and overcom without ani resort to danger violenc the two or three guard who had been seen at those point when our men arriv at these place they encount the small number it was customari to see and were push their way through when sudden there appear a strong bodi of nativ who drew their heavi sword and assum so threaten an attitud that our men lost no time in retreat a report of this occurr was made to the coloni each of the parti of young men have had an exact similar experi while there appear to be no good ground for the feel of uneasi which spread throughout the coloni a sens of oppress came over the stronger one and of fear over the weaker and a council have been held it was decid to ask an explan of the king other thing of some interest had happen among them a surreptiti acquir of consider knowledg of the island languag by me for this reason i was chosen as ambassador to the king my mission was a failur as the king though gracious inform me that this plan was necessari in secur complet isol from his peopl and he instruct me to tell my peopl that ani member of our coloni found beyond the line would be punish with death in addit to this the king seem hurt that we should have question the proprieti of his action said that thenceforward he himself would make the select of our peopl for deport the man evid superior of charact impress me with no littl effect and the sincer with which he regard us as belong to a race inferior to his in mental and moral strength confound me and place me at a disadvantag when i took the news to the coloni a mood border upon hopeless came upon our peopl the one of hastier temper suggest a revolt and a seizur of the island but this was so insan an idea that it was put away at onc not long afterward the king sent for absalom maywood one of our young men unmarri but with a mother among us maywood at first veri low with scurvi on the brig had drift into other ailment and was now an invalid and much wast i will not dwell upon the pathet part between him and his age mother nor upon the deeper gloom that fell upon the coloni what was becom of these men none might know whither they were taken and none could guess their after fate behind our effort to be cheer and industri there were heavi heart and possibl thought and fear that dare not seek express the third man was takenagain a sick onethi time a consumpt farmer name jackson and some time afterward a fourth an elder woman with a cancer she was mrs lyon former a millin in south boston then the patienc and hope which had sustain us gave way and we were in a condit close upon despair the cooler one among the men assembl quiet apart and debat what to do our captain a man quiet and brave still the leader in our council and alway advis patienc and obedi presid at this meet there was one dread thought upon everi mind but no man had the courag to bring it forth but after there had been some discuss without ani profit captain campbel made this speech my friend it doe not becom us longer to seek to conceal the thought which all of us have and which sooner or later must be spoken it is a matter of common knowledg that upon mani of the island of these sea there exist the horribl practic of cannib not a word was spoken for a long time and all were glad that it had come out at last not one man look at his neighbor or dare rais his glanc from the ground and there was a weight upon the heart of all nevertheless resum the captain it is extrem difficult to believ that this evil is upon us for you must have notic that onli the lean and sick one have been taken and sure this cannot mean cannib some had not thought of this and they look up quick with brighter face whereupon captain campbel proceed you must have observ howev that all of the sick and weak have gone and this bring a new situat upon us i have an idea which i will not give express to now and my desir in call you togeth was to determin it correct or falsiti for this purpos some man of dare and agil must risk his life near everi man present made offer of his servic but the captain shook his head and beg them all to remain quiet it is necessari he ad that this man understand the languag and i fear there is not one among you each man taken aback look at his neighbor and then all at me as i step forward the captain regard me grate and said let there now be a bind secreci among us for the other of the coloni must not know now and perhap never if our fear find a ground in truth there is all the greater reason for keep these matter secret among ourselv is that well understood then mr keat the plan is this when the next one of us is taken you are by strategi but in no event by violenc to escap from this imprison and discov the fate of that one and make report to us a week afterward these thing occur now with greater frequenc lemuel arthur a young man of twenti two was taken away about one oclock in the afternoon my whole plan have been studi out i array myself in the style of the nativ stain my skin with ochr blacken my eyebrow and hair with a mixtur of soot and tallow and without difficulti slip by the guard and found myself at larg and free upon the island i gain a high point and saw no sign of a boat make readi to put off with arthur when dark had come i descend to the villag i kept upon the outskirt and remain as much as possibl in shadow i dare not talk with ani one but i could listen and present i learn someth that made my heart stand still it has been so long sinc we had one said a nativ to his fellow yes and this one will be delici they say he is young and fat whi we have not touch ani sinc the four men and their woman with the jewelri came upon the island from a wreck true but this one will not go around among so mani of usmani must go without what of that those not suppli now will have all the keener relish when their turn come all that are left now are good and fat as the king has taken away all the lean and sick one he would not allow the peopl to touch them although some of them beg veri hard so to make sure they were place in the kiln so heavi a sick fell upon me when i heard this that i was near upon a betray of my presenc and certain i lost some of the talk which these men were have present i realiz that noth indic a horribl fate for my friend had been said my own fear were suffici to give a fright color to their languag when i look about me again they were gone and so with much caution i move to anoth part of the town keep alway in shadow at a certain place i heard anoth convers as follow doe he know what they will do with him no but he fear someth he doe not understand the languag he tri to get away this afternoon to go to the sea shore where he thought the boat was wait and when they made an effort to keep him quiet he becam veri angri what did they do then they took him to the king who was so kind that the young man becam quiet our king is so gentl and they alway believ what he tell themwhereupon the fellow broke into a hearti laugh and do the other suspect noth there is doubt about that kololu the farmer has report that they appear uneasi and disturb and hold secret meet what do you think they would do if they should discov everyth revolt i think for they appear to be fighter but they have no arm and we are more than a hundr to one that is true and so no live would be lost on either side after the revolt they would mere be kept in closer confin and no harm would come in the end they could be taken one at a time as is the present intent they might refus to eat suffici and henc becom lean that would come about sure but it would last onli for a time for you have notic that even our own peopl when condemn though they lose flesh at first invari becom reconcil to their end and at last becom fatter than ever the word of this man who was evid a functionari of the king inspir me with so great a horror that i could bear to hear no more so i move away consid whether i should return to the coloni and report what i had heard alreadi or remain to see this ghast tragedi to the end as there was noth to be gain by return at onc i decid to stay for through the horror of it all might come some suggest of a mean of deliver i soon becam awar by the make of all the peopl toward a certain quarter that someth of unusu import was afoot so as best i could i work my way around to the point of converg which was in the neighborhood of the king hous and there i saw an extraordinari prepar under way a larg bonfir was burn in an open place stand around it in a circl have a generous radius were hundr of the strang half savag of the island kept at their proper distanc by an arm patrol in a clear space at one side on higher ground was an elev seat which i surmis was reserv for the king manifest a matter of some moment was to be attend to have like a ceremoni charact the most curious featur of all this affair was the activ of a number of worker engag in drag larg hot stone from the fire and arrang them in the form of an oblong mound this mound had one peculiar featur a hollow space about six feet long and two feet wide was left within it and the men under the instruct of a leader were fashion it to a depth approach two feet all the stone be veri hot and difficult to handl even with the aid of barrow while they were still at work the great repress excit under which the peopl labor found an excus for express in the arriv of the king who trick out in unusu fineri walk solemn ahead of his attend to his elev seat then he gave an order which from my distanc i could not hear i push a littl closer under the safeti which the occas lent and overheard this convers how mani will get some of it onli forti i hear you know the women are not allow to have it yes the lead men will be suppli it make them strong and wise the next one will be given to sixti of the men who carri sword and the next after that to more of the swordsmen and so on until they all have had some and then the common peopl will be taken in like rotat but given a smaller allow at this junctur a strang process move from the king hous it was led by two priest chant dole behind them walk four men arm with curious implementsflail no doubt then came four warrior and behind them firm bound and complet nake walk my young friend arthur after him came six warrior arthur white skin show in strong contrast to that of the brown men around him his face was veri pale and his eye stare wide swept a quick glanc around for a stray hope the group stop in front of the king the nativ face and made an obeis and await further order befor all this had been done a man in front of me said to anoth those hot stone will cool i fear there is no danger they will keep their heat a long time if they were too hot they would burn it true they are much too hot now but it will be some time befor they will be need will they use the sword first as they did with those who had the jewelri no the best part then was spill this is a new idea of the king the flail will do just as well and will make it veri tender besid our king is a wise man by this time young arthur the king have given his order was surround by the arm men and between him and them were the four who carri flail his hand had been bound to a strong post sunk in the ground the king rais his hand as a signal and the four men brought down their flail with moder forc upon arthur nake bodi these implement were heavi and evid care was taken not to break the skin when the poor fellow felt the blow he shrank and quiver but utter no sound they fell again what was i do all this time what was i think i do not know but when the second blow had been deliv and arthur had cri out in his agoni i sprang through the encircl line of savag dash into the midst of the group surround the prison snatch a sword from a warrior leap upon the king and split his head in twain turn cut arthur bond caught him by the hand and fled at full speed with him into the dark never had been a surpris more completeth peopl had seen one of their own number as they suppos free the prison and murder their king soon there came a howl and some start in pursuit butther was the bodi of the king and the stone were hot and wait there was no longer author our pursuer fell off one by one and the other thus discourag gave up the chase we ran to the shore found a boat and put out to sea we are freew two but to what purpos we have no idea of the direct of the land we are without food we dare not return to our friend for onli in the desper hope of our find land can there be the least encourag for their rescu we have row all night it is now well into the follow afternoon we have had noth to eat or drink and we are begin to suffer we both are nake and the sun seem will burn us up i therefor make this record with materi which i had been prudent to provid for such an emerg and i shall now give it to the sea with such earnest prayer for it

a dog this give a wide rang for accid with but one opportun in a lifetim in the cerebrum the intellect and the affect in the cerebellum the sens and the motor forc in the medulla oblongata control of the diaphragm in these two latter lie all the essenti of simpl exist the cerebrum is mere an adorn that is to say reason and the affect are almost pure ornament i have alreadi prove it my dog with it cerebrum remov was idiot but it retain it physic sens to a certain degre while thus rumin he made care prepar he move the couch replac the oper tabl under the skylight select a number of surgic instrument prepar certain drug mixtur and arrang water towel and all the accessori of a tedious surgic oper sudden he burst into laughter poor fool he exclaim paid me five thousand dollar to kill him didnt have the courag to snuff his own candl singular singular the queer freak these madmen have you thought you were die poor idiot allow me to inform you sir that you are as much aliv at this moment as ever you were in your life but it will be all the same to you you shall never be more conscious than you are now and for all practic purpos so far as they concern you you are dead henceforth though you shall live by the way how should you feel without a head ha ha ha but that a sorri joke he lift the unconsci form from the loung and laid it upon the oper tabl about three year afterward the follow convers was held between a captain of polic and a detect she may be insan suggest the captain i think she is and yet you credit her stori i do singular not at all i myself have learn someth what much in one sens littl in anoth you have heard those queer stori of her husband well they are all nonsensicalprob with one except he is general a harmless old fellow but peculiar he has perform some wonder surgic oper the peopl in his neighborhood are ignor and they fear him and wish to be rid of him henc they tell a great mani lie about him and they come to believ their own stori the one import thing that i have learn is that he is almost insan enthusiast on the subject of surgeryespeci experiment surgeri and with an enthusiast there is hard such a thing as a scrupl it is this that give me confid in the woman stori you say she appear to be frighten doubli sofirst she fear that her husband would learn of her betray of him second the discoveri itself had terrifi her but her report of this discoveri is veri vagu argu the captain he conceal everyth from her she is mere guess in party in other partno she heard the sound distinct though she did not see clear horror close her eye what she think she saw is i admit preposter but she undoubt saw someth extrem fright there are mani peculiar littl circumst he has eaten with her but few time dure the last three year and near alway carri his food to his privat room she say that he either consum an enorm quantiti throw much away or is feed someth that eat prodigi he explain this to her by say that he has anim with which he experi this is not true again he alway keep the door to these room care lock and not onli that but he has had the door doubl and otherwis strengthen and has heavili bar a window that look from one of the room upon a dead wall a few feet distant what doe it mean ask the captain a prison for anim perhap certain not whi becaus in the first place cage would have been better in the second place the secur that he has provid is infinit greater than that requir for the confin of ordinari anim all this is easili explain he has a violent lunat under treatment i had thought of that but such is not the fact how do you know by reason thus he has alway refus to treat case of lunaci he confin himself to surgeri the wall are not pad for the woman has heard sharp blow upon them no human strength howev morbid could possibl requir such resist strength as has been provid he would not be like to conceal a lunat confin from the woman no lunat could consum all the food that he provid so extrem violent mania as these precaut indic could not continu three year if there is a lunat in the case it is veri probabl that there should have been communic with some one outsid concern the patient and there has been none the woman has listen at the keyhol and has heard no human voic within and last we have heard the woman vagu descript of what she saw you have destroy everi possibl theori said the captain deepli interest and have suggest noth new unfortun i cannot but the truth may be veri simpl after all the old surgeon is so peculiar that i am prepar to discov someth remark have you suspicion i have of what a crime the woman suspect it and betray it certain becaus it is so horribl that her human revolt so terribl that her whole natur demand of her that she hand over the crimin to the law so fright that she is in mortal terror so aw that it has shaken her mind what do you propos to do ask the captain secur evid i may need help you shall have all the men you requir go ahead but be care you are on danger ground you would be a mere playth in the hand of that man two day afterward the detect again sought the captain i have a queer document he said exhibit torn fragment of paper on which there was write the woman stole it and brought it to me she snatch a hand out of a book get onli a part of each of a few leav these fragment which the men arrang as best they could were the detect explain torn by the surgeon wife from the first volum of a number of manuscript book which her husband had written on one subjectth veri one that was the caus of her excit about the time that he began a certain experi three year ago continu the detect he remov everyth from the suit of two room contain his studi and his oper room in one of the bookcas that he remov to a room across the passag was a drawer which he kept lock but which he open from time to time as is quit common with such piec of furnitur the lock of the drawer is a veri poor one and so the woman while make a thorough search yesterday found a key on her bunch that fit this lock she open the drawer drew out the bottom book of a pile so that it mutil would more like escap discoveri saw that it might contain a clew and tore out a hand of the leav she had bare replac the book lock the drawer and made her escap when her husband appear he hard ever allow her to be out of his sight when she is in that part of the hous the fragment read as follow the motori nerv i had hard dare to hope for such a result although induct reason had convinc me of it possibl my onli doubt have been on the score of my lack of skill their oper has been onli slight impair and even this would not have been the case had the oper been perform in infanc befor the intellect had sought and obtain recognit as an essenti part of the whole therefor i state as a prove fact that the cell of the motori nerv have inher forc suffici to the purpos of those nerv but hard so with the sensori nerv these latter are in fact an offshoot of the former evolv from them by natur though not essenti heterogen and to a certain extent are depend on the evolut and expans of a contemporan tendenc that develop into mental or mental function both of these latter tendenc these evolv are mere refin of the motori system and not independ entiti that is to say they are the blossom of a plant that propag from it root the motori system is the first nor am i surpris that such prodigi muscular energi is develop it promis yet to surpass the wildest dream of human strength i account for it thus the power of assimil had reach their full develop they had form the habit of do a certain amount of work they sent their product to all part of the system as a result of my oper the consumpt of these product was reduc fulli one half that is to say about one half of the demand for them was withdrawn but forc of habit requir the product to proceed this product was strength vital energi thus doubl the usual quantiti of this strength this energi was store in the remain develop a tendenc that did surpris me natur no longer suffer the distract of extran interfer and at the same time be cut in two as it were with refer to this case did not fulli adjust herself to the new situat as doe a magnet which when divid at the point of equilibrium renew itself in it two fragment by invest each with opposit pole but on the contrari be sever from law that theretofor had control her and possess still that mysteri tendenc to develop into someth more potenti and complex she blind have lost her lantern push her demand for materi that would secur this develop and as blind use it when it was given her henc this marvel vorac this insati hunger this wonder raven and henc also there be noth but the physic part to receiv this vast store of energi this strength that is becom almost hour herculean almost daili appal it is becom a serious narrow escap to day by some mean while i was absent it unscrew the stopper of the silver feed pipe which i have alreadi herein term the artifici mouth and in one of it curious antic allow all the chyle to escap from it stomach through the tube it hunger then becam intensei may say furious i place my hand upon it to push it into a chair when feel my touch it caught me clasp me around the neck and would have crush me to death instant had i not slip from it power grasp thus i alway had to be on my guard i have provid the screw stopper with a spring catch and usual docil when not hungri slow and heavi in it movement which are of cours pure unconsci ani appar excit in movement be due to local irregular in the blood suppli of the cerebellum which if i did not have it enclos in a silver case that is immov i should expos and the captain look at the detect with a puzzl air i dont understand it at all said he nor i agre the detect what do you propos to do make a raid do you want a man three the strongest men in your district whi the surgeon is old and weak nevertheless i want three strong men and for that matter prudenc realli advis me to take twenti at one oclock the next morn a cautious scratch sound might have been heard in the ceil of the surgeon oper room short afterward the skylight sash was care rais and laid asid a man peer into the open noth could be heard that is singular thought the detect he cautious lower himself to the floor by a rope and then stood for some moment listen intent there was a dead silenc he shot the slide of a dark lantern and rapid swept the room with the light it was bare with the except of a strong iron stapl and ring screw to the floor in the centr of the room with a heavi chain attach the detect then turn his attent to the outer room it was perfect bare he was deepli perplex return to the inner room he call soft to the men to descend while they were thus occupi he re enter the outer room and examin the door a glanc suffic it was kept close by a spring attach and was lock with a strong spring lock that could be drawn from the insid the bird has just flown muse the detect a singular accid the discoveri and proper use of this thumb bolt might not have happen onc in fifti year if my theori is correct by this time the men were behind him he noiseless drew the spring bolt open the door and look out into the hall he heard a peculiar sound it was as though a gigant lobster was flounder and scrambl in some distant part of the old hous accompani this sound was a loud whistl breath and frequent rasp gasp these sound were heard by still anoth personth surgeon wife for they origin veri near her room which were a consider distanc from her husband she had been sleep

he heard the hiss sound and the clumsi flounder of a bulki live object in the direct of his wife apart it evid was advanc toward him a turn in the corridor shut out the view he turn up the light which reveal a ghast pallor in his face wife he call there was no respons he hurri advanc the four men follow quiet he turn the angl of the corridor and ran so rapid that by the time the offic had come in sight of him again he was twenti step away he ran past a huge shapeless object sprawl crawl and flounder along and arriv at the bodi of his wife he gave one horrifi glanc at her face and stagger away then a furi seiz him clutch the knife firm and hold the lamp aloft he sprang toward the ungain object in the corridor it was then that the offic still advanc cautious saw a littl more clear though still indistinct the object of the surgeon furi and the caus of the look of unutter anguish in his face the hideous sight caus them to paus they saw what appear to be a man yet evid was not a man huge

never gave it in his blind furi he lost his caution and was caught in an iron grasp the struggl threw the lamp some feet toward the offic and it fell to the floor shatter to piec simultan with the crash the oil took fire and the corridor was fill with flame the offic could not approach befor them was the spread blaze and secur behind it were two form struggl in a fear embrac they heard cri and gasp and saw the gleam of a knife the wood in the hous was old and dri it took fire at onc and the flame spread with great rapid the four offic turn and fled bare escap with their live in an hour noth remain of the mysteri old hous and it inmat but a blacken ruin an origin reveng on a certain day i receiv a letter from a privat soldier name gratmar attach to the garrison of san francisco i had known him but slight the acquaint have come about through his interest in some stori which i had publish and which he had a way of call psycholog studi he was a dreami romant fine grain lad proud as a tiger lili and sensit as a blue bell what mad capric led him to join the armi i never knew but i did know that there he was wretch out of place and i foresaw that his rude and repel environ would make of him in time a desert or a suicid or a murder the letter at first seem a wild outpour of despair for it inform me that befor it should reach me it author would be dead by his own hand but when i had read farther i understood it spirit and realiz how coolli form a scheme it disclos and how terribl it purport was intend to be the worst of the content was the inform that a certain offic whom he name had driven him to the deed and that he was commit suicid for the sole purpos of gain therebi the power to reveng himself upon his enemi i learn afterward that the offic had receiv a similar letter this was so puzzl that i sat down to reflect upon the young man peculiar he had alway seem somewhat uncanni and had i prove more sympathet he doubtless would have gone farther and told me of certain problem which he profess to have solv concern the life beyond this one thing that he had said came back vivid if i could onli overcom that pure gross and anim love of life that make us all shun death i would kill myself for i know how far more power i could be in spirit than in flesh the manner of the suicid was startl and that was what might have been expect from this odd charact evid scorn the flummeri of funer he had gone into a littl canyon near the militari reserv and blown himself into a million fragment with dynamit so that all of him that was ever found was some minut particl of flesh and bone i kept the letter a secret for i desir to observ the offic without rous his suspicion of my purpos it would be an admir test of a dead man power and deliber intent to haunt the live for so i interpret the letter the offic thus to be punish was an oldish man short apoplect overbear and irasc general he was kind to most of the men in a way but he was gross and mean and that explain suffici his harsh treatment of young gratmar whom he could not understand and his effort to break that flighti young man spirit not veri long after the suicid certain modif in the offic conduct becam appar to my watch oversight his choler though none the less sporad develop a qualiti which had some of the characterist of senil and yet he was still in his prime and pass for a sound man he was a bachelor and had live alway alon but present he began to shirk solitud at night and court it in daylight his brother offic chaf him and thereupon he would laugh in rather a forc and silli fashion quit differ from the ordinari way with him and would sometim on these occas blush so violent that his face would becom almost purpl his soldier alert and stern relax surpris at some time and at other were exagger into unnecessari acerb his conduct in this regard suggest that of a drunken man who know that he is drunk and who now and then make a brave effort to appear sober all these thing and more indic some mental strain or some dread apprehens or perhap someth wors than either were observ part by me and part by an intellig offic whose watch upon the man had been secur by me to be more particular the afflict man was observ often to start sudden and in alarm look quick round and make some unintellig monosyllab answer seem to an inaud question that no visibl person had ask he acquir the reput too of have taken late to nightmar for in the middl of the night he would shriek in the most dread fashion alarm his roommat prodigi after these attack he would sit up in bed his ruddi face devoid of color his eye glassi and shine his breath broken with gasp and his bodi wet with a cold perspir knowledg of these develop and transform spread throughout the garrison but the few most women who dare to express sympathi or suggest a tonic encount so violent rebuff that they bless heaven for escap aliv from his word volley even the garrison surgeon who had a kind manner and the command general who was construct on dignifi and impress line receiv littl thank for their solicitud clear the doughti old offic who had fought like a bulldog in two war and a hundr battl was suffer deepli from some undiscover maladi the next extraordinari thing which he did was to visit one even not so clandestin as to escap my watch a spirit mediumextraordinari becaus he alway had scof at the idea of spirit communic i saw him as he was leav the medium room his face was purpl his eye were bulg and terrifi and he totter in his walk a policeman see his distress advanc to assist him whereupon the soldier hoars beg call a hack into it he fell and ask to be driven to his quarter i hastili ascend to the medium room and found her lie unconsci on the floor soon with my aid she recal her wit but her conscious state was even more alarm than the other at first she regard me with terror and cri it is horribl for you to hound him so i assur her that i was hound no one oh i thought you were the spiri meanioh but it was stand exact where you are she exclaim i suppos so i agre but you can see that i am not the young man spirit howev i am familiar with this whole case madam and if i can be of ani servic in the matter i should be glad if you would inform me i am awar that our friend is persecut by a spirit which visit him frequent and i am posit that through you it has inform him that the end is not far away and that our elder friend death will assum some terribl form is there anyth that i can do to avert the tragedi the woman stare at me in a horrifi silenc how did you know these thing she gasp that is immateri when will the tragedi occur can i prevent it yes yes she exclaim it will happen this veri night but no earth power can prevent it she came close to me and look at me with an express of the most acut terror merci god what will becom of me he is to be murder you understandmurd in cold blood by a spiritand he know it and i know it if he is spare long enough he will tell them at the garrison and they will all think that i had someth to do with it oh this is terribl terribl and yet i dare not say a word in advancenobodi there would believ in what the spirit say and they will think that i had a hand in the murder the woman agoni was piti be assur that he will say noth about it i said and if you keep your tongu from wag you need fear noth with this and a few other hurri word of comfort i sooth her and hasten away for i had interest work on hand it is not often that one may be in at such a murder as that i ran to a liveri stabl secur a swift hors mount him and spur furious for the reserv the hack with it generous start had gone far on it way but my hors was nimbl and his leg felt the prick of my eager a few mile of this furious pursuit brought me within sight of the hack just as it was cross a dark ravin near the reserv as i came nearer i imagin that the hack sway somewhat and that a flee shadow escap from it into the tree bank further wall of the ravin i certain was not in error with regard to the sway for it had rous the dull notic of the driver i saw him turn with an air of alarm in his action and then pull up with a heavi swing upon the rein at this moment i dash up and halt anyth the matter i ask i dont know he answer get down i felt the carriag sway and i see that the door wide open guess my load thought hed sober up enough to get out and walk without troubl me or his pocket book meanwhil i too had alight then struck a match and by it light we discov through the open door the load huddl confus on the floor of the hack face upward his chin compress upon his breast by his lean against the further door and look altogeth vulgar misshapen and miser unlik a soldier he neither move nor spoke when we call we hastili clamber within and lift him upon the seat but his head roll about with an aw loos and freedom and anoth match disclos a ghast dead face and wide eye that stare horribl at noth you would better drive the bodi to headquart i said instead of follow i canter back to town hous my hors and went straightway to bed and this will prove to be the first inform that i was the mysteri man on a hors whom the coron could never find about a year afterward i receiv the follow letter which is observ to be in fair english from stockholm sweden dear sirfor some year i have been read your remark psycholog studi with great interest and i take the liberti to suggest a theme for your abl pen i have just found in a librari here a newspap date about a year ago in which is an account of the mysteri death of a militari offic in a hack then follow the particular as i have alreadi detail them and the veri theme of post mortem reveng which i have adopt in this set out of fact some person may regard the coincid between my correspond suggest and my privat and exclus knowledg as be a veri remark thing but there are like even more wonder thing in the world and at none of them do i longer marvel more extraordinari still is his suggest that in the dynamit explos a dog or a quarter of beef might as well have been employ as a suicid mind man that in short the man may not have kill himself at all but might have employ a presumpt of such an occurr to render more effect a physic persecut end in murder by the live man who had pose as a spirit the letter even suggest an arrang with a spirit medium and i regard that also as a queer thing the declar purpos of this letter was to suggest materi for anoth of my psycholog studi but i submit that the whole affair is of too grave a charact for treatment in the leviti of fiction and if the fact and coincid should prove less puzzl to other than to me a praiseworthi servic might be done to human by the present of whatev solut a better understand than mine might evolv

littl barkentin of light tonnag but wonder sail qualiti is rememb in everi port between sitka and callao all sort of strang stori are told of her exploit but these most were manufactur by superstiti and high imagin sailor who common demonstr the natur affin exist between idl and lie it has been said not onli that she engag in smuggl piraci and blackbird which is kidnap gilbert island and sell them to the coffe planter of central america but that she maintain special relat with satan found on the power of mysteri charm which her skipper was suppos to have procur from some mysteri sourc and was known to employ on occas beyond the inform which his manifest and clearanc paper divulg noth of his suppos shadi oper could be learn either from him or his crew for his sailor like him were a strang silent lotal sharp keen eye young fellow who never drank and who kept to themselv when in port an uncommon circumst was that there were never ani vacanc in the crew except one that happen as the result of freeman last visit to rabaya and it came about in the follow remark manner freeman like most other men who follow the sea was superstiti and he ascrib his fair luck to the charm which he secret procur from rabaya it is now known that he visit the mystic whenev he came to the port of san francisco and there are some to day who believ that rabaya had an interest in the suppos buccan enterpris of the blue crane among the most intellig and activ of the blue crane crew was a malay known to his mate as the fli devil this had come to him by reason of his extraordinari agil no monkey could have been more activ than he in the rig he could make fli leap with astonish eas he could not have been more than twenti five year old but he had the shrivel appear of an old man and was small and lean his face was smooth shave and wrinkl his eye deep set and intens black and brilliant his mouth was his most forbid featur it was larg and the thin lip were drawn tight over larg and protrud teeth it aspect be prognath and menac although quiet and not given to laughter at time he would smile and then the express of his face was such as to give even freeman a sensat of impend danger it was never clear known what was the real mission of the blue crane when she sail the last time from san francisco some suppos that she intend to loot a sunken vessel of her treasur other that the enterpris was one of simpl piraci involv the kill of the crew and the scuttl of the ship in mid ocean other that a certain larg consign of opium for which the custom author were on the lookout was like about to be smuggl into some port of puget sound in ani event the busi ahead must have been import for it is now known that in order to ensur it success freeman bought an uncommon expens and potent charm from rabaya when freeman went to buy this charm he fail to notic that the fli devil was slyli follow him neither he nor the half blind charm seller observ the malay slip into rabaya den and wit the matter that there went forward the intrud must have heard someth that stir everi evil instinct in him rabaya whom i could hard be persuad to believ under oath year afterward told me that the charm which he sold to freeman was one of extraordinari virtu for mani generat it had been in the famili of one of india proudest rajah and until it was stolen the arm of england could not prevail over that part of the far east if born by a person of lofti charact as he solemn inform me he believ freeman to be it would never fail to bring the highest good fortun for although the amulet was laden with evil power as well as good a worthi person could resist the evil and employ onli the good contrariwis the amulet in the hand of an evil person would be a most potent and danger engin of harm it was a small and veri old trinket made of copper and repres a serpent twine grotesqu about a human heart through the heart a dagger was thrust and the loop for hold the suspend string was form by one of the coil of the snake the charm had a wonder histori which must be reserv for a futur stori the sum of it be that as it had been as often in the hand of bad men as of good it had wrought as mani calam as bless it was perfect safe and usefulso rabaya sober told mein the hand of such a man as freeman now as no one know the sound and breadth of his own wicked the fli devil who rabaya explain must have overheard the convers attend it transfer to freeman reflect onli that if he could secur possess of the charm his fortun would be made as he could not procur it by other mean he must steal it moreov he must have seen the pricef thousand dollar in goldwhich freeman paid for the trinket and that alon was suffici to move the malay cupid at all event it is known that he set himself to steal the charm and desert from the barkentin from this point on to the catastroph my inform is somewhat hazi i cannot say for instanc just how the theft was commit but it is certain that freeman was not awar of it until a consider time had pass what did concern him particular was the absenc of the malay when the barkentin was weigh anchor and give a line for a tow out to sea the malay was a valuabl sailor to replac him adequ was clear so imposs a task that freeman decid after a profitless and delay search of hour to leav port without him or anoth in his place it was with a heavi heart somewhat lighten by a confid assumpt that the amulet was safe in his possess that freeman head down the channel for the golden gate meanwhil the fli devil was have strang adventur in a hastili arrang disguis the princip featur of which was a gentleman street dress in which he might pass careless scrutini as a thrifti japanes awkward tri to adapt himself to the custom of his environ he emerg from a water front lodg hous of the

saw not onli a great part of the citi but also near the whole of the bay of san francisco and the shore town and mountain lie beyond his first particular attent was given to the blue crane upon which he look near straight down as she roll gentl at her moor at the foot of lombard street two mile to the west he saw the tree which conceal the soldier barrack and the command general resid on the high promontori known as black point and these invit him to seek conceal in their shadow until the advent of night would enabl him to work his way down the peninsula of san francisco to the distant blue mountain of san mateo surmis that freeman would make a search for him and that it would be confin to the dock and their near vicin he imagin that it would not be a difficult matter to escap after get his bear the malay was in the act of descend the hill by it northern flank when he observ a stranger lean against the parapet crown the hill the man seem to be watch him not reflect that his somewhat singular appear might have account for the scrutini his suspicion were rous he fear albeit wrong that he was follow for the stranger had come up soon after him assum an air of indiffer he stroll about until he was veri near the stranger and then with the swift and feroc of a tiger he sprang and slip a knife blade between the man rib the stranger sank with a groan and the malay fled down the hill it was a curious circumst that the man fell in front of one of the open which neglect had permit the rain to wash underneath the parapet he flounder as some die men will and these movement caus him to

an air the desper spirit of pervers which possess the man and which rabaya afterward explain by the possess of the amulet made reckless by a belief that the charm which he carri would preserv him from all menac led him to steal a small hand satchel that lay on the beach near a well dress woman he walk away with it and then open it and was rejoic to find that it contain some money and fine jewelri at this junctur one of the children who had observ the malay theft call the woman attent to him she start in pursuit rais a loud outcri which empti the adjac drink saloon of a pursu crowd the malay leap forward with ampl abil to outstrip all his pursuer but just as he arriv in front of a larg swim establish a bullet from a policeman pistol brought him to his knee the crowd quick press around him the crimin stagger to his feet made a fierc dash at a man who stood in his way and sank a good knife into his bodi then he bound away fled swift past a narrow beach where swim club have their hous and disappear in the ruin of a larg old build that lay at the foot of a sandi bluff on the water edg he was trail a short distanc within the ruin by a thin stream of blood which he left and there he was lost it was suppos that he had escap to the old woollen mill on black point as in all other case where a mob pursu a flee crimin the search was wild and disord so that if the malay had left ani trail beyond the ruin it would have been obliter by trampl feet onli one policeman was in the crowd but other summon by telephon were rapid approach from all direct unintellig and contradictori rumor bewild the polic for a time but they form a long picket line cover an arc which stretch from north beach to the new gas work far beyond black point it was about this time that captain freeman cast off and start out to sea the summit of black point is crown with the tall eucalyptus tree which the fli devil had seen from telegraph hill a high fenc which enclos the general hous extend along the bluff of black point near the edg a sentri pace in front of the gate to the ground keep out all who had not provid themselv with a pass the sentri had seen the crowd gather toward the east and in the distanc he notic the brass button of the polic glisten in the western sunlight he wonder what could be afoot while he was thus engag he observ a small dark wiri man emerg upon the bluff from the direct of the woollen mill at it eastern base the stranger made straight for the gate you cant go in there said the soldier unless you have a pass da wat ask the stranger a pass repeat the sentri and then see that the man was a foreign and imperfect acquaint with english he made sign to explain his remark still carri his bayonet tip rifl at shoulder arm the stranger whose sharp gleam of eye gave the soldier an odd sensat nod and smile oh said he i have he thrust his hand into his side pocket advanc meanwhil and send a swift glanc about in the next moment the soldier found himself sink to the ground with an open jugular the malay slip within the ground and disappear in the shrubberi it was near an hour afterward that the soldier bodi was discov and the crowd of polic and citizen arriv it becam known to the garrison that the desper crimin was immedi at hand the bugl sound and the soldier came tumbl out of barrack then began a search of everi corner of the post it is like that a feel of relief came to mani a stout heart when it was announc that the man had escap by water and was now be swift carri down the channel toward the golden gate by the ebb tide he was clear seen in a small boat keep such a cours as was possibl by mean of a rude board in place of oar his escap had occur thus upon enter the ground he ran along the eastern fenc behind the shrubberi to a transvers fenc separ the garden from the rear premis he leap the fenc and then found himself face to face with a larg and formid mastiff he kill the brute in a strang and bold mannerbi choke there was evid of a long and fear struggl between man and brute the appar reason for the man failur to use the knife was the first necess of choke the dog into silenc and the subsequ need of employ both hand to maintain that advantag after dispos of the dog the fli devil wound though he was perform a feat worthi of his sobriquet he leap the rear fenc at the foot of the bluff he found a boat chain to a post sunk into the sand there was no way to releas the boat except by dig up the post this the malay did with his hand for tool and then threw the post into the boat and push off with a board that he found on the beach then he swung out into the tide and it was some minut afterward that he was discov from the fort and then he was so far away and there was so much doubt of his ident that the gunner hesit for a time to fire upon him then two dramat thing occur meet the drift boat was a heavi bank of fog which was roll in through the golden gate the murder was head straight for it paddl vigor with the tide if onc the fog should enfold him he would be lost in the pacif or kill on the rock almost beyond a peradventur and yet he was head for such a fate with all the strength that he possess this was what first convinc his pursuer that he was the man whom they soughtnon other would have pursu so desper a cours at the same time a marin glass brought convict and the order was given to open fire a six pound brass cannon roar and splinter flew from the boat but it occup with tantal bravado rose and wave his hand defiant the six pounder then sent out a percuss shell and just as the frail boat was enter the fog it was blown into a thousand fragment some of the observ swore posit that they saw the malay flounder in the water a moment after the boat was destroy and befor he was engulf by the fog but this was deem incred in a short time the order of the post had been restor and the polic had taken themselv away the other dramat occurr must remain larg a matter of surmis but onli becaus the evid is so strang the great steel gun employ at the fort to announc the set of the sun thrust it black muzzl into the fog had it been fire with shot or shell it missil would have struck the hill on the opposit side of the channel but the gun was never so load blank cartridg were suffici for it function the bore of the piec was of so generous a diamet that a child or small man might have crept into it had such a feat ever been thought of or dare there are three circumst indic that the flee man escap aliv from the wreck of his boat and that he made a safe land in the fog on the treacher rock at the foot of the bluff crown by the gun the first of these was suggest by the gunner who fire the piec that day two or three hour after the destruct of the flee man boat and even that would have receiv no attent under ordinari circumst and in fact did receiv none at all until long afterward when rabaya report that he had been visit by freeman who told him of the two other strang circumst the gunner relat that when he fire the cannon that day he discov that it recoil in a most unaccount manner as though it had been load with someth in addit to a blank cartridg but he had load the gun himself and
