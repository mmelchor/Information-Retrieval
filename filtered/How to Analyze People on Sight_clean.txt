benedict is known nation have conduct lectur cours in mani of the larg eastern citi her work is base upon the practic method of modern scienc as work out in the world lead laboratori where exhaust test are appli to determin individu type talent vocat bent and possibl san francisco bulletin januari 25 1919 it not how much you know but what you can do that count human analysisth x ray modern scienc has prove that the fundament trait of everi individu are indel stamp in the shape of his bodi head face and handsan x ray by which you can read the characterist of ani person on sight the most essenti thing in the world to ani individu is to understand himself the next is to understand the other fellow for life is larg a problem of run your own car as it was built to be run plus get along with the other driver on the highway from this book you are go to learn which type of car you are and the main reason whi you have not been get the maximum of servic out of yourself also you are go to learn the make of other human car and how to get the maximum of co oper out of them this co oper is vital to happi and success we come in contact with our fellowman in all the activ of our live and what we get out of life depend to an astound degre on our relat with him reaction to environ ¶ the greatest problem face ani organ is success reaction to it environ environ speak scientif is the sum total of your experi in plain unit state this mean fit vocate social and marit into the place where you are if you dont fit you must move or chang your environ to fit you if you cant chang the environ and you wont move you will becom a failur just as tropic plant fail when transplant to the nevada desert learn from the sagebrush ¶ but there is someth that grow and keep on grow in the nevada desertth sagebrush it couldnt move away and it couldnt chang it waterless environ so it did what you and i must do if we expect to succeed it adapt itself to it environ and there it stand each littl stalwart shrub a remind of what even a plant can do when it tri move wont help much ¶ human life face the same altern that confront all other form of lifeof adapt itself to the condit under which it must live or becom extinct you have an advantag over the sagebrush in that you can move from your citi or state or countri to anoth but after all that is not much of an advantag for though you may improv your situat slight you will still find that in ani civil countri the main element of your problem are the same understand yourself and other ¶ so long as you live in a civil or thick popul communiti you will still need to understand your own natur and the natur of other peopl no matter what you desir of life other peopl aim ambit and activ constitut vital obstruct along your pathway you will never get far without the co oper confid and comradeship of other men and women primit problem ¶ it was not alway so and it recent in human histori may account for some of our blind to this great fact in primit time peopl saw each other rare and had much less to do with each other the human element was then not the chief problem their environment problem had to do with such thing as the element violent storm extrem of heat and cold dark the ever present menac of wild beast whose flesh was their food yet who would eat them first unless they were quick in brain and bodi civil chang ¶ but all that is chang man has subjug all other creatur and now walk the earth it suprem sovereign he has discov and invent and build until now we live in skyscrap talk around the world without wire and by press a button turn dark into daylight caus of failur ¶ yet with all our knowledg of the outsid world nineti nine live out of everi hundr are compar failur ¶ the reason is plain to everi scientif investig we have fail to studi ourselv in relat to the great environment problem of today the stage set has been chang but not the play the game is the same old gameyou must adjust and adapt yourself to your environ or it will destroy you master his own environ ¶ the citi of today look differ from the jungl of our ancestor and we imagin that becaus the brain of man overcam the old menac no new one have arisen to take their place we no longer fear extermin from cold we turn on the heat we are not afraid of the vast ocean which held our primit forebear in thrall but pass swift safe and luxuri over their surfac and soon we shall be breakfast in new york and dine the same even in san francisco face new enemi ¶ but in build up this stupend superstructur of modern civil man has brought into be a societi so intric and complex that he now face the new environment problem of human relationship the modern spider web ¶ today we depend for life necess almost wholli upon the activ of other the work of thousand of human hand and thousand of human brain lie back of everi meal you eat everi journey you take everi book you read everi bed in which you sleep everi telephon convers everi telegram you receiv everi garment you wear and this fellowman of our has multipli sinc that dim distant dawn into almost two billion human be with at least one billion of them after the veri thing you want and not a tenth enough to go around adapt or die ¶ who will win natur answer for you she has said with aw and inexor final that whether you are a blade of grass on the nevada desert or a man in the street of london you can win onli as you adapt yourself to your environ today our environment problem consist larg of the other fellow onli those who learn to adapt themselv to their fellow can win great or last reward extern indic intern natur ¶ to do this it is necessari to better understand our neighborsto recogn that peopl differ from each other in their like and dislik trait talent tendenc and capabl the combin of these make each individu natur it is not difficult to understand other for with each group of these trait there alway goe it correspond physic makeupth extern wherebi the intern is invari indic this is true of everi speci on the globe and of everi subdivis within each speci signific of size shape and structur ¶ all dog belong to the same speci but there is a great differ between the natur of a st bernard and that of a terrier just as there is a decid differ between the natur of differ human be but in both instanc the action reaction and habit of each can be accur anticip on sight by the shape size and structur of the two creatur differ in breed ¶ when a terrier come into the room you instinct draw away unless you want to be jump at and greet effus but you make no such movement to protect yourself from a st bernard becaus you read on sight the differ natur of these two from their extern appear ¶ you know a rose a violet a sunflow and an orchid and what perfum you are sure to find in each by the same method all are flower and all belong to the same speci just as all human be belong to the same speci but their respect size shape and structur tell you in advanc and on sight what their respect characterist are the same is true of all human be they differ in certain fundament but alway and invari in accord with their differ in size shape and structur the instinct of self preserv ¶ the reason for this is plain goad by the instinct of self preserv man like all other live thing has made heroic effort to meet the demand of his environ he has been more success than ani other creatur and is as a result the most complex organ on the earth but his most baffl complex resolv themselv into compar simpl term onc it is recogn that each intern chang brought about by his environ brought with it the correspond extern mechan without which he could not have surviv interrel of bodi and brain ¶ so today we see man a high evolv creatur who not onli act but think and feel all these thought feel and emot are interrel the bodi and the mind of man are so close bound togeth that whatev affect one affect the other an instantan chang of mind instant chang the muscl of the face a violent thought instant bring violent bodili movement movi and face muscl ¶ the move pictur industrysaid to be the third largest in the worldi base larg on this interrel this industri would becom extinct if someth were to happen to sever the connect between extern express and the intern natur of men and women tell fundament ¶ how much do extern characterist tell about a man they tell with amaz accuraci all the basic fundament princip trait of his natur the size shape and structur of a man bodi tell more import fact about his real selfwhat he think and what he doesthan the averag mother ever know about her own child learn to read ¶ if this sound imposs if the seem incongru multipl and heterogen of human qualiti have baffl you rememb that this is exact how the print in all book and newspap baffl you befor you learn to read not long ago i was read stori aloud to a three year old she want to see the pictur and when told there were none had to be shown the book what funni littl mark she cri point to the print how do you get stori out of them print look to all of us at first just mass of meaningless littl mark but after a few day at school how thing did begin to clear up it wasnt a jumbl after all there was someth to it it straighten itself out until the funni littl mark becam signific each of them had a mean and the same mean under all condit through them your whole outlook on life becam deepen and broadenedal becaus you learn the mean of twenti six littl letter and their combin read peopl ¶ learn to read men and women is a more delight process than learn to read book for everi person you see is a true stori more romant and absorb than ani ever bound in cover learn to read peopl is also a simpler process than learn to read book becaus there are fewer letter in the human alphabet though man seem to the untrain eye a mystifi mass of funni littl mark he is not now difficult to analyz onli a few feel ¶ this is becaus there are after all but a few kind of human feel some form of hunger love hate fear hope or ambit give rise to everi human emot and everi human thought thought bring action ¶ now our action follow our thought everi thought howev transitori caus muscular action which leav it trace in that part of the physic organ which is most close alli to it physiolog and psycholog interwoven ¶ look into the mirror the next time you are angri happi surpris tire or sorrow and note the chang wrought by your emot in your facial muscl constant repetit of the same kind of thought or emot final make perman chang in that part of the bodi which is physiolog relat to these mental process the evolut of the jaw ¶ the jaw is a good illustr of this allianc between the mind and the bodi it muscl and bone are so close alli to the pugnac instinct center in the brain that the slightest thought of combat caus the jaw muscl to stiffen let the thought of ani actual physic encount go through your mind and your jaw bone will automat move upward and outward after a lifetim of combat whether by fist or word the jaw set perman a littl more upward and outwarda littl more like that of the bulldog it keep to this combat mold becaus say mother natur the great effici expert if you are go to call on me constant to stiffen that jaw ill fix it so it will stay that way and save myself the troubl inherit of acquir trait ¶ thus the more combat jaw have becom perman in the man organ can be pass on to his children ¶ right here come a most interest law and one that has made possibl the scienc of human analysi law of size ¶ the larger ani part or organ the better it equip for carri out the work of that organ and the more doe it tend to express itself natur is an effici expert and doesnt give you an oversuppli of anyth without demand that you use it jaw becom smaller ¶ our ancestor develop massiv jaw as a result of constant combat as fast as civil decreas the necess for combat natur decreas the size of the averag human jaw mean of the big jaw ¶ but wherev you see a larg protrud jaw you see an individu arm and engin as kipl say for some kind of fight the larg jaw alway goe with a combat natur whether it is found on a man or a woman a child a pugilist or a minist exhibit ath irishman ¶ the larg jaw therefor is seen to be both a result and a caus of certain thing as the inherit of a fight ancestor it is the result of million of year of fight in prehistor time and like ani other over develop part or organ it has an intens urg to express itself this inher urg is what make the owner of that jaw fight at the drop of the hat and often have a chip on his shoulder natur select ¶ thus becaus everi extern characterist is the result of natur law and chiefli of natur select the vital trait of ani creatur can be read from his extern everi student of biolog anatomi anthropolog ethnolog or psycholog is familiar with these fact built to fit ¶ man organ has develop alter improv and evolv down through the slow revolv year with one instinct aimsuccess reaction to it environ everi part has been labori construct to that sole end becaus of this it function are mark as clear upon it as those of a grain elev a steamship or a piano surviv of the fittest ¶ natur has no accid she wast no materi and everyth has a purpos if you put up a good fight to live she will usual come to your rescu and give you enough of whatev is need to tide you over if you dont she say you are not fit to peopl the earth and let you go without a pang thus she weed out all but the strongand evolut march on caus of racial characterist ¶ this inher potenti for alter the organ to meet the demand of the environ is especi notic in race and is the reason for most racial differ differ in environmentclim altitud and topographi necessit most of these physic differenti which today enabl us to know at a glanc whether a man belong to the white race the yellow race or the black race the result of these differenti and modif will be told in the various chapter of this book type earlier than race ¶ the student of human analysi read the disposit and natur of everi individu with eas regardless of whether that individu be an american a frenchman a kaffir or a chinaman becaus human analysi explain those fundament trait which run through everi race color and nation accord to the extern which alway go with those trait five biolog type ¶ human analysi differ from everi other system of charact analysi in that it classifi man for the first time into five type accord to his biolog evolut ¶ it deal with man in the light of the most recent scientif discoveri it estim each individu accord to his human qualiti rather than his charact or so call moral qualiti in other word it take his measur as a human be and determin from his extern his chanc for success in the world of today these rule work ¶ everi rule in this book is base on scientif data has been prove to be accur by investig and survey of all kind of peopl in all part of the world these rule do not work mere part of the time they work all the time under all condit and appli to everi individu of everi race everi color everi countri everi communiti and everi famili through this latest human scienc you can learn to read peopl as easili as you read booksif you will take the littl time and pain to learn the rule which compos your work alphabet do what we want to do ¶ it is easi to know what an individu will do under most circumst becaus everi human be doe what he want to do in the way he prefer to do it most of the time if you doubt it tri this test bring to mind ani intim friend or even that husband or wife and note how few chang they have made in their way of do thing in twenti year prefer inborn ¶ everi human be is born with prefer and predilect which manifest themselv from earliest childhood to death these inborn tendenc are never obliter and seldom control to ani great extent and then onli by individu who have learn the power of the mind over the bodi inasmuch as this knowledg is possess by onli a few most of the peopl of the earth are blind follow the dictat of their inborn lean follow our bent ¶ in other word more than nineti nine per cent of all the peopl you know are follow their natur bent in react to all their experiencesfrom the most trivial incid to the most far reach emerg took it from grandmoth ¶ the individu is seldom conscious of these habitu act of his much less of where he got them the nearest he come is to say he got it from his father or she take it from grandmoth but where did grandmoth get it man no mysteri ¶ scienc has taken the troubl to investig and today we know not onli where grandmoth got it but what she did with it she got it along with her size shape and structurein other word from her typeand she did just what you and everybodi els doe with his type characterist she act in accord with her type just as a canari sing like a canari instead of talk like a parrot and just as a rose give off rose perfum instead of violet this law hold throughout everi speci and explain manwho like to think himself a deep mysterya it explain everi other creatur the hold of habit ¶ look around you in shop offic field or home and you will find that the quick alert impuls man is act quick alert and impuls most of the time noth less than a calam slow him down and then onli temporarili while the slow patient mild and passiv individu is act slowli patient mild and passiv in spite of all goad some overwhelm passion or crisi may speed him up momentarili but as soon as it fade he revert to his old slow habit signific of fat bone and muscl ¶ human analysi is the new scienc which show you how to recogn the slow man the quick man the stubborn man the yield man the leader the learner and all other basic kind of men on sight from the shape size and structur of their bodi certain bodili shape indic predisposit to fat lean boni muscular and nervous and this predisposit is so much a part of the warp and woof of the individu that he can not disguis it the urg given him by this inborn mechan is so strong as to be practic irresist everi experi of his life call forth some kind of reaction and invari the reaction will be similar in everi vital respect to the reaction of other peopl who have bodi of the same general size shape and structur as his own succeed at what we like ¶ no person achiev success or happi when compel to do what he natur dislik to do sinc these like and dislik stay with him to the grave one of the biggest modern problem is that of help men and women to discov and to capit their inborn trait enthusiasm and self express ¶ everi individu doe best those thing which permit him to act in accord with his natur bent this explain whi we like best those thing we do best it take real enthusiasm to make a success of ani undertak for noth less than enthusiasm can turn on a full current we struggl from the cradl to the grave for self express and everyth that push us in a direct oppos to our natur tendenc is done half heart ineffici and disgruntl these are the step that lead straight to failur yet failur can be avoid and success approxim by everi normal person if he will take the same precaut with his own machineri that he take with his automobil learn to drive your car ¶ if you were present with a car by your ancestorswhich is precis what happen to you at birthyou would not let an hour go by without find out what make or type of car it was befor a week elaps you would have taken the time labor and interest to learn how to run itnot mere ani old way but the best way for that particular make of car five make of human car ¶ there are five make or type of human car differ as definit in size shape and structur as ford differ from pierc arrow each human type differ as wide in it capac possibl and aptitud as a ford differ from a pierc arrow like the ford or pierc the extern indic these function differ with unfail accuraci furthermor just as a ford never chang into a pierc nor a pierc into a ford a human be never chang his type he may modifi it train it polish it or control it somewhat but he will never chang it can not be deceiv ¶ the student of human analysi cannot be deceiv as to the type of ani individu ani more than you can be deceiv about the make of a car one may doll up a ford to his heart contentremov the hood and top and put on custom made substitutesit is still a ford alway will be a ford and you can alway detect that it is a ford it will do valuabl necessari thing but onli those thing it was design to do and in it own particular manner nor could a pierc act like a ford are you a ford or a pierc ¶ so it is with human car mayb you have been awe by the jewel and cloth with which mani human ford disguis themselv the chanc are that you have overlook a dozen pierc this week becaus their paint was rusti perchanc you are a pierc yourself draw a ford salari becaus you dont know you are a high power machin capabl of make ten time the speed you have been make on your highway of life superfici sway us ¶ if so your mistak is onli natur the world classifi human be accord to their superfici to the world a human motorcycl can pass for a roll royc ani day if suffici camouflag with diamond curl french heel and pluck eyebrow bicycl in congress ¶ in the same manner mani a bicycl in human form get elect to congress becaus he play his machineri for all it is worth and get a hundr per cent servic out of it everi such person learn earli in life what kind of car he was and capit it natur tendenc dont judg by veneer ¶ noth is more unsaf than to attempt to judg the actual natur of peopl by their cloth hous religi faith polit affili prejudic dialect etiquett or custom these are onli the veneer laid on by upbring teacher preacher tradit and other forc of suggest and it is a veneer so thin that trifl scratch it off the real alway there ¶ but the real individu is alway there fill with the tendenc of his type bend alway toward them constant seek opportun to run as he was built to run forev strive toward self express it is this ever activ urg which caus him to revert in the manifold activ of everyday life to the method manner and peculiar common to his type this mean that unless he get into an environ a vocat and a marriag which permit of his do what he want to do he will be miser ineffici unsuccess and sometim crimin caus of crime ¶ that this is the true explan of crime has been recogn for mani year by lead thinker two prison wardensthoma tynan of colorado and thoma mott osborn of sing singeffect initi penal reform base upon it everi crime like everi person problem aris from some kind of situat wherein instinct is thwart by outsid influenc ¶ human analysi teach you to recogn on sight the predomin instinct of ani individualin brief what that individu is inclin to do under all the general situat of his life you know what the world tri to compel him to do if the discrep between these two is beyond the reach of his type he refus to do what societi demand this and this onli is back of everi human digress from indiscret to murder it is as vain to expect to erad these inborn trend and put other in their place as to make a sew machin out of an airplan or an oak out of a pine the most man can do for his neighbor is to understand and inspir him the most he can do for himself is to understand and organ his inborn capac find your own type ¶ the first problem of your happi is to find out what type you are yourselfwhich you will know after read this bookand to build your futur accord know and help other ¶ the second is to learn how to analyz other to the end that your relationship with them may be harmoni and mutual advantag take everi individu accord to the way he was born accept him as that kind of mechan and deal with him in the manner befit that mechan in this way and this onli will you be abl to impress or to help other in this way onli will you be abl to achiev real success in this way onli will you be abl to help your fellowman find the work the environ and the marriag wherein he can be happi and success the four cs ¶ to get the maximum of pleasur and knowledg out of this interest cours there are four thing to rememb as your part of the contract read concentr ¶ think of what you are read while you are read it concentr is a veri simpl thing the next c is observ care ¶ look at peopl care but not stare when analyz them dont jump at conclus we human have a great way of twist fact to fit our conclus as soon as we have made one but dont spend all your time get readi to decid and forget to decid at all like the man who was go to jump a ditch he ran so far back to get a good start each time that he never had the strength to jump when he got there get a good start by observ care then decid confid ¶ be sure you are right and then go ahead make a decis and make it with the confid that you are right if you will determin now to follow this rule it will compel you to follow the first two becaus in order to be sure you are right to be certain you are not misjudg anybodi you will read each rule concentr and observ each person care beforehand practis constant ¶ practic make perfect take this for your motto if you would becom expert in analyz peopl it is one easili follow for you come in contact with peopl everywhereat home amongst your busi associ with your friend and on the street rememb you can onli benefit from a thing as you use it a car that you never took out of the garag would be of no valu to you so get full valu out of this cours by use it at all time these rule your tool ¶ these rule are scientif they are true and they are true alway they are veri valuabl tool for the further of your progress through life an understand of peopl is the greatest weapon you can possess therefor these are the most precious tool you can own but like everi tool in the world and all knowledg in the world they must be use as they were built to be use or you will get littl servic out of them you would not expect to run a car proper without pay the closest attent to the rule for clutch brake starter and gear everyth scientif is base not on guess but law this cours in analyz peopl on sight is as scientif as the automobil it will carri you far and do it easili if you will do your part your part consist of learn the few simpl rule laid down in this book and in appli them in the everyday affair of your life fewer and truer ¶ mani thing which have been found to be true in almost everi instanc could have been includ in this cours but we prefer to make fewer statement and have those of bedrock certainti therefor this cours like all our cours consist exclus of those fact which have been found to be true in everi particular of peopl in normal health import the five extrem ¶ this book deal with pure or unmix type onli when you understand these the signific of their sever combin as seen in everyday life will be clear to you the human alphabet ¶ just as you can not understand the mean of a word until you know the letter that go into the makeup of that word you cannot analyz peopl accur until you get these five extrem type firm in your mind for they are your alphabet found in five biolog system ¶ each pure type is the result of the over develop of one of the five biolog system possess by all human beingsth nutrit circulatori muscular boni or nervous therefor everi individu exhibit to some degre the characterist of all the five type the secret of individu ¶ but his predomin trait and individualityth thing that make him the kind of man he isagre infal with whichev one of the five system predomin in him combin common in america ¶ the averag american man or woman is a combin of some two of these type with a third discern in the background to analyz peopl ¶ to understand human be familiar yourself first with the pure or unmix type and then it will be easi and fascin to spell out their combin and what they mean in the peopl all about you postpon combin ¶ until you have learn these pure type thorough it will be to your advantag to forget that there is such a thing as combin after you have these extrem type well in mind you will be readi to analyz combin the five type ¶ scienc has discov that there are five type of human be discard for a moment their technic name they may be call the fat peopl the florid peopl the muscular peopl the boni peopl and the mental peopl each vari from the other in shape size and structur and is recogniz at a glanc by his physiqu or build this is becaus his type is determin by the preponder within his bodi of one of the five great depart or biolog systemsth nutrit the circulatori the muscular the boni or the nervous at birth ¶ everi child is born with one of these system more high develop larger and better equip than the other type never disappear ¶ throughout his life this system will express itself more be more intens and constant in it function than the other and no manner of train educ environ or experi so long as he remain in normal health will alter the predomin of this system nor prevent it dictat his like dislik and most of his reaction effect of eat ¶ if you do not understand whi the overact of one bodili system should influenc a man natur see if you cant recal more than one occas when a squar meal made a decid differ in your disposit within the space of thirti minut if one good meal has the power to alter so complet our person temporarili is it then ani wonder that constant overfeed caus everybodi to love a fat man for the fat man is habitu and chronic in that beatif state which come from over eat illustr 1 aliment the enjoy chapter i the aliment type the enjoy note bear in mind at the begin of this and everi other chapter that we are describ the extrem or unmix type befor leav this book you will understand combin type and should read peopl as readili as you now read your newspap those individu in whom the aliment system is more high develop than ani other are call aliment the aliment system consist of the stomach intestin alimentari canal and everi part of the assimil apparatus physic rotund ¶ a general rotund of outlin character this type he is round in everi direct fat roll away from his elbow wrist knee and shoulder see chart 1 the fat overweight individu ¶ soft flesh thick pad over a small bone bodi distinguish the pure aliment type in men of this type the largest part of the bodi is around the girth in women it is around the hip these alway indic a larg nutrit system in good work order fat is onli surplus tissueth amount manufactur by the assimil system over and abov the need of the bodi fat is more soft and spongi than bone or muscl and lend to it wearer a softer structur and appear small hand and feet ¶ becaus his bone are small the pure aliment has small feet and small hand how mani time you have note with surpris that the two hundr pound woman had tini feet the inconveni of get around which you have notic in her is due to the fact that while she has more weight to carri she has smaller than averag feet with which to do it the pure aliment head ¶ a head compar small for the bodi is anoth characterist of the extrem aliment the neck and lower part of the head are cover with roll of fat this give the head the effect of spread outward from the crown as it goe down to the neck thus give the neck a short disproportion larg appear the round face person ¶ a full moon face with doubl or tripl chin give this man his babi face see chart 2 look

drummer funni stori ¶ you will note that the convers of fat peopl is well sprinkl with funni stori they enjoy a good joke better than ani other type for a reason which will becom more and more appar to you ¶ that salesmen are popular suppos to regal each custom with yarn till he gasp for breath and to get his signatur on the dot line while he is in that weaken condit is more or less of a myth it origin from the fact that most salesmen are fat and that fat peopl tell stori well joke at fat men expens ¶ look at fatti get a truck and other jibe greet the fat man on everi hand he know he can not proceed a block without be the butt of sever joke but he listen to them all with an amiabl surpris to other type and this good natur is so appar that even those who make sport of him are think to themselv i believ id like that man the fat man habit ¶ never hurri and never worri are the unconsci standard under mani of the reaction of this type if you will compil a list of the habit of ani fat person you will find that they are most the outgrowth of one or both of these motiv wont speed up ¶ you would have a hard time get an aliment to follow out ani protract line of action call for strenuos speed or high tension he will get as much done as the strenuous man when their mental are equaland often more the fat person keep go in a straight line with uniform and uninterrupt effort and doe not have the blow out common to more fidgeti peopl but hard fast labor is not in his line love comedi ¶ all form of mental depress are foreign to fat peopl as long as they are in normal health we have known a fat husband and wife to be eject for rent and spend the even at the movi laugh like four year old at charli chaplin or a mack sennett comedi you have sometim seen fat peopl whose financi

the worst habit of this type are those inevit to the eas love and the immatur mind indol is one of his most undesir trait and cost the aliment dear in this countri where energi push and lightn like effici are at a premium onli the fat man of brain can hope to keep up the inertia caus by his digest process is so great that it is almost insurmount the heavi lazi feel you have after a larg meal is with the fat man intermin becaus his organ is constant in the process of digest larg amount of food like warm room ¶ love of comfortespeci such thing as warm room and soft bedsi so deepli imbed in the fiber of this type that he has ever to face a fight with himself which the rest of us do not encount this sometim lead the excess corpul person to relax into lazi and slovenli an obes individu sometim surpris us howev by his ambit and immacul but such a man or woman almost alway combin decid mental tendenc with his aliment enjoy do favor ¶ the habit which endear the fat person to everyon and make

upon him far greater penalti than fall upon those who associ with him someth that can not be said of the fault of some other type like melodi ¶ simpl natur music is a favorit with fat peopl love song rollick tune and those full of melodi are most popular with them an easi to learn easi to sing song is the one a fat man choos when he name the next select they like ragtim jazz and music with a swing to it music the world over is most popular with fat race the world greatest singer and most of it famous musician have been fat or at least decid plump goe to the cabaret ¶ the fat person will wiggl his toe tap his finger swing his fork and nod his head by the hour with a rumbl jazz orchestra when the aliment is combin with some other type he will also enjoy other kind of music but the pure aliment care most for primal tune and melodi like a gir show ¶ a pretti girl show make a hit with fat women as well as with fat men drop into the pass show and note how mani fat peopl are in the audienc drop into a theater the next night where a tragedi is be enact and see how few fat one are there the one made sport of ¶ fat peopl enjoy help out the player if the opportun offer all show peopl know this when one of those trick is to be play from the foot light upon a member of the audienc the girl who doe it is alway care to select that circular gentleman down front let her tri to mix up confetti or a toy balloon with a tall skinni man and the polic would get a hurri call when we describ the boni type you will note how veri differ he is from our friend the fat man a movi fan ¶ the fat man theater would be a fit name for the movi hous of the countri not that the fat man is the onli type patron the cinema the movi cover in one even so mani differ kind of human interestsnew cartoon featur and comedythat everi type find upon the screen someth to interest him but if you will do what we have donestand at the doorway of the lead movi theater of your citi ani even and keep a record of the type that enter you will find the plump are as numer as all the other combin easi entertain ¶ the reason for this is plain to all who are acquaint with human analysi the fat man want everyth the easiest possibl way and the movi fulfil this requir more fulli than ani other theatric entertain he can drop in when he feel like it and there is no wait for the show to start for one thing this is a decid advantag to him for fat peopl do not like to depend upon themselv for entertain the babi of the race ¶ the first stage in biolog evolut was the stage in which the alimentari apparatus was develop to assimil nutriment was the first function of all life and is so still sinc it is the princip requir for self preserv be the first and most element of our five physiolog system the alimentivewhen it overtop the othersproduc a more element infantil natur the pure aliment has right been call the babi of the race this account for mani of the characterist of the extrem fat person includ the fact that it is difficult for him to amus himself he of all type like most to be amus and veri simpl toy and activ are suffici to do it love the circus ¶ a serious drama or problem play usual bore him but he seldom miss a circus the fat person express his immatur also in that he like to be pet made over and look after ¶ like the infant he demand food first almost the onli time a fat man lose his temper is when he has been depriv of his food the next demand on his list is sleep anoth characterist of the immatur give a fat man three squar a day and plenti of sleep in a comfort bed and he will walk off with the prize for good humor three hundr and sixti five day in the year next to sleep he demand warm cloth in winter and steam heat when the wintri wind blow fat peopl at the beach ¶ if it were not for the exert requir in get to and from the beach dress and undress and the momentari cold of the water mani more aliment would go to the beach in summer than do not strenuous ¶ anyth to be popular with the aliment must be easi to get easi to do easi to get away from easi to drop if he feel like it anyth requir the expenditur of great energi even though it promis pleasur when achiev is usual pass over by the fat peopl the art of get out of it ¶ let georg do it is anoth bit of slang invent by this type he seldom doe anyth he realli hate to do he is so likabl he either induc you to let him out of it or get somebodi to do it for him he just natur avoid everyth that is intens difficult or strenuous the peaceabl type ¶ if an unpleas situat of a person or social natur arisesa quarrel a misunderstand or ani kind of disagreementth fat man will tri to get himself out of it without a discuss except when they have squar face in which case they are not pure aliment extrem fat peopl do not mix up in neighborhood famili church club or polit quarrel it is too much troubl for one thing and for anoth it is oppos to his peaceabl untens natur avoid expens quarrel ¶ the fat man has his eye on person advantag and promot and he know that quarrel are expens not alon in the chanc they lose him but in nerv forc and peac of mind the fat man know instinct that peac time are the most profit time and though he is not for peac at ani price so far as the countri is concern he certain is much inclin that way where he is person concern you will be amus to notic how this peac love qualiti increas as one weight increas the more fat ani individu is the more is he inclin to get what he want without hostil the real thing ¶ the favorit good time of the aliment is one where there are plenti of refresh a dinner invit alway make a hit with him but bewar that you do not lure a fat person into your home and give him a tea with lemon wisp where he expect a full meal alway readi for food ¶ substanti viand can be serv to him ani hour of the day or night with the certainti of pleas him he love a banquet provid he is not expect to make a speech the fat man has a harder time than ani other listen to long speech the fashion of tri to mix the two most opposit extremesfood and ideasand expect them to go down was due to our misunderstand of the real natur of human be it is rapid go out as must everi fashion which fail to take the human instinct into account avoid sport ¶ no prize lure a fat man into strenuous physic exercis or violent sport although we have wit numer state nation and intern tenni polo row sprint hurdl and swim contest we have seen not one player who was fat enough to be includ in the pure aliment type the grand stand bleacher and tour car at these contest contain a generous number of fat peopl but their convers indic that they were present more from person interest in some contest than in the game itself the nearest a fat man usual come to take strenuous exercis is to drive in an open car the more eas that car the better he like it he avoid long walk as he would the plagu and catch a street car for a two block trip the person element ¶ due to his immatur the fat person give littl thought to anyth save those thing which affect him person the calm exterior unruffl counten and air of deliber he sometim wear and which have occasion pass for judici qualiti are larg the result of the fact that the aliment refus to get stir up over anyth that doe not concern him person this person element will be found to domin the activ convers and interest of the aliment for him to like a thing or buy a thing it must come pretti near be someth he can eat wear live in or otherwis person enjoy he confin himself to the concret and tangibl but most

the point head but is mere a slope of the face upward and downward from the cheek bone as a result of the unusu width of the nose section see chart 4 his well develop nose ¶ the nose section is also high and wide becaus the typic thorac has a nose that is well develop this is shown not onli by it length but by it high bridg illustr 4 typic thorac face the caus for the width and length of this

handl implement and all kind of hand instrument with littl blunder also their movement are more grace than those of other type the thorac walk ¶ the springi step must have been invent to describ the walk of the thorac no matter how hurri his walk has more grace than the walk of other type he doe not stumbl and it is seldom that a thorac step on the train of his partner gown the grace sitter ¶ the way you sit tell a great deal about your natur one of the first secret it betray is whether you are by natur grace or ungain the person who sit grace who seem to drape himself becom upon a chair and to aris from it with eas is usual a thorac their excess of energi sometim give them the appear of fidget but it is an easi grace fidget and not as disturb as that of other type keen eye and ear sens ¶ quick eye and keen ear are characterist of the thorac the million of stimulith sound sight and smell imping everi wake moment upon the human consciousnessaffect him more quick and more intens than ani other type the acut of all our sens depend to a far greater extent than we have hitherto suppos upon proper heart and lung action take long deep breath for five minut in the open air while walk rapid enough to make your heart pound and see how much keener your sens are at the end of that time the thorac is chronic in this condit becaus his heart and lung are go at top speed habitu and natur all his life suscept to heat ¶ becaus bodili temperatur vari accord to the amount of blood and the rapid of it circul this type is alway warmer than other he is extrem suscept to heat suffer keen in warm room or warm weather and wear fewer wrap in winter the major of bather at the beach in summer are larg of this type the high strung ¶ nerv as taut as a violin stringdu to his acut physic sens and his thin sensit skinplus his instantan quick make the thorac what is known as high strung the most temperament ¶ becaus he is key to high c by natur the thorac has more of that qualiti call tempera than ani other type the wag who said that tempera was most temper might have revers it and still have been right for temper is larg a matter of tempera sinc the thorac have more tempera it follow natur that they have more temper or rather that they show it often just as they show their delight qualiti often a continu perform ¶ this type conscious and unconsci is a continu perform he is show you someth of himself everi moment and if you are interest in human natur as your read of this book suggest you are go to find him a fascin subject he is express his feel with more or less abandon all the time and he is like to express as mani as a dozen differ one in as mani moment the quick temper ¶ fli off the handl and go up in the air are phrase origin inspir by our dear delight friend the thorac other type do these more or less temperament thing but they do not do them as frequent nor on as short notic as this type the human firefli ¶ a fieri natur is part and parcel of the thorac makeup but did you ever see a fieri natur man who didnt have lot of warm friend it is the grouchin whom the fire start slowli and smoulder indefinitelythat nobodi like but the man who flare up flame for a moment and is calm the next never lack for companion or devote the red hair ¶ one may belong to the thorac type whether his hair is blond or brunett or ani of the shade between but it is an interest fact that most of the red hair are larg of this type he didnt have red hair for noth is a famous phrase that has been appli to the red hair quick temper thorac for generat you will be interest to note that this high color and high chest are distinct notic in most of the red hair peopl you knowcertain proof that they approxim this type as you walk down the street tomorrow look at the peopl ahead of you and when you find a red head notic how much more red his neck is than the neck of the peopl walk besid him this flush skin almost alway accompani red hair show that most red hair peopl belong to this type the flash in the pan ¶ the red hair man temper usual expend itself instant his red hot fieri is over in a moment but for everi enemi he has two friendsfriend who like his flame even though in constant danger from it themselv wherea the aliment avoid you if he disagre with you the thorac like to tell you in a few hot word just what he think of you but the chanc are that he will be so complet over it by lunch time that he will invit you out with him desir for approb ¶ to be admir and a wee bit envi are desir dear to the heart of this type everybodi to a greater or lesser degre desir these thing but to no other type do they mean so much as to this one we know this becaus no other type in ani such number take the troubl or make the sacrific necessari to bring them about act indic desir ¶ the ego of everi individu crave approv but the major of the other type crave someth els moreth particular someth in each case depend upon the type to which the individu belong you can alway tell what ani individu want most by what he doe the man who think he want a thing or wish he want it talk about get it envi those who have it and plan to start do someth about it but the man who realli want a thing goe after it sacrific his leisur his pleasur and sometim love itselfand get it shine in public life ¶ the lime light appeal more to this type than to other becaus it goe further toward gratifi his desir for approb so while other men and women are dream of fame the thorac practis plough and plead his way to it the person adul of friend and of the multitud is the breath of life to him extrem of this type consid no self denial too great a price to pay for it mani on the stage ¶ the stage in all it form is as natur a field to the thorac as salesmanship is to the aliment the plea of fond papa and fearsom mama are usual ineffect with this type of boy or girl when he set his heart on a career befor the foot light or in the movi whether they achiev it or not will depend on other and chiefli mental trait in each individu makeup but the yearn for it in some form is alway there so the manag wait room are alway crowd with peopl of this type it is this intens of desir which has goad and inspir most stage artist on to success in their chosen field put yourself in his place ¶ to be abl to put one self in the role of anoth to feel as he feel to be so keen sensit to his situat and psycholog that one almost becom that person for the time be is the heart and soul of act the thorac has this sensit natur after long studi and acquaint you may be abl to put yourself in the place of a few friend the thorac doe this instant and automat tendenc not toil make fame ¶ those who have succeed to fame in ani given line are wont to proclaim hard work is the secret of success and to take great credit unto themselv for the labor they have expend on their own it is true of cours that all success entail hard work but the man or woman suffici gift to rise to the height get from that gift such a strong inward urg toward it express that what he doe in that direct is not work to him the long hour concentr and studi devot to it are more pleasur than pain to him he choos such activ voluntarili natur the real artist ¶ noth can right be call work which one doe out of sheer prefer work never made an actress and work never made a singer where innat talent for these art was lack natur the true maker of everi famous name bestow nineti per cent and man if he hustl can provid the other veri necessari ten but his sens of humor if not his sens of justic should be suffici to prevent his tri to rob the almighti of his due success for all ¶ everi individu who is not feebl mind can be a success at someth in this big world everi normal mind individu is abl to creat invent improv organ build or market some of the myriad of thing the world is cri for but he will succeed at onli those thing in which his physiolog and psycholog mechan perform their function easili and natur whi we work ¶ man is by inclin veri littl of a worker he is first a wantera bundl of instinct second a feelera bundl of emot last and least he is a thinker what real work he doe is done not becaus he like it but becaus it serv one of these first two bundl of instinct when the desir for leisur is stronger than the other urg leisur win but in all ambiti men and women the desir for other thing outweigh the leisur urg ambit and type ¶ now what is it that caus some to have ambit and other to lack it your ambit take the form determin by your predomin physiolog system for instanc in everi great singer the thorac has been present either as the first or second element the effect of the physic upon our talent is no more mark anywher than here for it is his unusu lung power his high chest the sound board in his nose section and his superior vocal cord that make the real foundat of everi singer fame these physiolog condit are found in extrem degre onli in person of thorac tendenc it was the great lung power of caruso that made him a great singer it was his remark heart power that brought him through an ill in februari 1921 when everi newspap in the world carri on it front page the posit statement that he could not live anoth day that he live for six month afterward was due chiefli to his remark heart the natur result from a larg heart and larg lung is one distinct differ from all othersin short the thorac natur the best dress ¶ the best dress man and the best dress woman in your town belong predomin to this type this is no accid the thorac be possess of acut eye sens are more sensit to color and line than ani other type these are the foundat of style and artist groom cloth can unmak the man ¶ be desir of the approv of other and realiz that though cloth do not make the man they can unmak him this type look to his laurel on this point becaus cloth determin the first impress we make upon stranger and becaus that impress is difficult to chang cloth are of vast import in this maze of human relationship the thorac is more sensit to the attitud of other becaus their attitud is more vital to his self express he sens from childhood the bear that cloth have for or against him in the opinion of other and how they can aid him to express his person the glass of fashion ¶ the thorac therefor often becom the glass of fashion and the mold of form his conscious of himself is so keen that even when alon he prefer those thing in dress which are at onc fine fanci and fashion some type are indiffer to cloth some ignor of cloth and some defiant in their cloth but the thorac alway has a keen sens of fit in the matter of apparel distinct in dress ¶ the distinct dresser is one who essay the extrem fashion the last moment touch he is alway a step or two ahead of the time his tie handbag handkerchief and stick pin are up to the minut such a man or woman invari has a larg thorac develop and is well repaid by the public for his pain dress the univers languag ¶ the public look more eager than we suppos to chang in style and fad it give in spite of itself instantan admir of a sort to those who follow the dictat of fashion this be one of the quickest road to adul it is often util by this type the newest in hairdress ¶ the latest thing in coiffur is alway known by the thorac woman and becaus she is more often than ani other type a beauti woman she can wear her hair in almost ani style and find it becom so when puff were the thing this type of woman not onli wore puff but the most extrem and numer puff when the stick to the face style was in vogu she bought much bandolin and essay the sleekest and shiniest head of all when the ear bun rage she chang those same paper like curl over night into verit young sofa cushion alway on dress parad ¶ with intent to keep the spotlight on himself the thorac is alway on dress parad he is vivid awar of himself he know what kind of pictur he is make he is seldom self conscious in the sens of be timid when he doe happen to be timid he suffer by reason of his greater desir for approv more acut than ani other type affect his keynot ¶ instantan reaction to stimuliwith all the reflex action result therefromconstitut the keynot of this type this make an individu who is physiolog and psycholog affect becaus life is full of all kind of stimuli act dure everi wake moment upon everi sens in the organ ani person who is high strung find himself in the midst of what might be call nerv bedlam get the most out of everyth ¶ becaus of this same high sensit makeup the thorac get more sensat out of everi incid than the rest of us do he experi more joy in the space of a lifetim but also more disappoint the human violin ¶ for the same reason that the violin vibrat to a greater number of sound than the organ the thorac is a more vibrant individu than other he is impel to an express of voic manner and action that often look like pretenc to less impuls peopl in other type it would be but to the thorac it is so natur and normal that he is often much surpris to hear that he has the reput of be affect a reput for flighti ¶ this lightn like liveli of face bodi and voic his quick repli and instantan reaction to everyth also caus him to be call flighti the quick thinker ¶ we are prone to judg everi one by ourselv peopl whose mental or physic sens are less key up less sensit call the thorac rattl brain usual such a man brain is not rattl at all it is work as all brain do in respons to the messag reach it via the telegraph wire of the five sens in the thorac these wire happen to be more taut than in the other type he get sensat from sight sound tast touch and smell much more quick than the rest of us do these messag are sent to the brain more rapid and sinc sensat is respons for much of our think this man brain think a littl more speedili than that of other type it doe not necessarili think ani better often it doe need slow down but compar to the thought power of some of the other type the thorac speed make up for much of his careless he make more mistak in judgment than other type but can right about face so quick he usual remedi them while other type are still tri to decid when to start to hold himself back is the hardest lesson for this type to learn his changeabl ¶ this tendenc to let himself go bring the thorac a great deal of unhappi and failur he plung so quick that he often fail to take into consider the various element of the situat his physic sens tell him a thing should be done and rush him headlong into action that he know are ill advis the moment he has time to think them over in turn around and right his mistak he often hear himself call changeabl and vacil his bat averag ¶ in this as in other thing we have a tendenc toward smug shortsighted and egot the man who make but one mistak a year becaus he make but two decis is wrong fifti per cent of the time yet he self satisfi consid himself superior to the thorac becaus he has caught the latter in six poor deal within six month at the rate the averag thorac act this would be about one mistak in a thousanda much better bat averag than the other man but becaus the confid of other in our stabil is of prime import to us all this type or ani one inclin to definit thorac tendenc should take pain to prevent this impress from settl into the mind of his friend should get onto the highway ¶ the greatest reason for strive toward stabil in action and more slow in decis howev is for his own futur sake the man who is constant make decis and be compel to alter them get nowher he may have the best engin and the finest car in the world but if he run first down this by path and then that he will make littl progress on the main highway should have an aim ¶ an aim a definit goal is essenti to the progress of ani individu it should be made with care and in keep with one person talent train educ environ and experi and have been made should be adher to with the determin which doe not permit littl thing to interfer with it elimin non essenti ¶ the big problem of individu success is the problem of elimin non essentialsof hew to the line let the chip fall where they may most of the thing that steal your time strength money and energi are noth but chip if you pay too much attent to them you will never hew out anyth worth while no vain regret ¶ if you are a thorac dont regret the fact that you are not a one decis a year man but tri to make fewer and better decis your quick if call into counsel will enabl you to see from what instinct your mistak habitu aris and the direct in which most of them have point and you will see this with so much greater dispatch than the averag person that you will lose littl time you should begin today to analyz your most common error in judgment that you may guard against their recurr alway slight thrill ¶ even when appar compos the thorac is alway a wee bit thrill everyth he see hear touch tast or smell give him such keen sensat that he live momentarili in some kind of adventur he languish in an unchang environ and find monotoni almost unbear light and shadow ¶ never two minut the same fit describ this type he pass rapid from one vivid sensat to anoth and express each one so complet that he is soon readi for the next he has fewer complex than ani other type becaus he doe not inhibit as much the uncork bottl ¶ the lid is alway off of the thorac this be the case he suffer littl from mental congest though he sometim pay a high price for his self express everybodi is interest ¶ most of us are much more interest than the world suspect but the world is not made up of mind reader we keep our most interest thought and the most interest side of ourselv hidden away even your dearest friend are seldom given a peep into the actual you and this despit the fact that we all recogn this as a defici in other we bottl up ourselv and defi the world cork screwsal save the thorac he allow his associ to see much of what is pass in his mind all the time becaus we are all interest in the real individu and not in mask this type usual is much sought after not secret ¶ the thorac doe not by prefer cover up he doe not by prefer secret he doe not except when necessari keep his plan and way dark he is like to tell not onli his famili but his newest acquaint just what he is plan to do and how he expect to do it the natur secret person who vagu refer to a certain parti when he has occas to speak of anoth is the exact opposit of this type his human interest ¶ we are all interest in the littl come and go of our friend upon this fact everi magazin and newspap build it human interest stori we may be indiffer to what the presid of the unit state is do about intern relat but what he had for breakfast is mighti interest few peopl read inaugur address signific though they often are to the world and to the reader himself but if the presid would write ten volum on just how i spend my sunday it would be a best seller natur confidenti ¶ person experi person secret and person prefer are subject we are all interest in these are the veri thing with which the thorac regal his friend and about which he is more frank and outspoken than ani other type he make mani friend by his obvious open and his capac for see the interest detail which other overlook charm conversationalist ¶ color vivid word and phrase come easili to the tongu of this type for he see the unusu the fascin in everyth sinc ani one can make a thing interest to other if he is realli interest in it himself the thorac make other see and feel what he describ he is therefor known as the most charm conversationalist beauti voic ¶ the most beauti voic belong to peopl who are larg of this type this is due as we have said befor to physiolog caus the high chest sensit vocal cord capaci sound board in the nose and roof of the mouth all tend to give the voic of the thorac mani nuanc and accent never found in other type his pleas voic plus the vivid of his express and his lack of retic in give the intim and interest detail are other trait which help to make the thorac a live companion the lure of spontan ¶ the most belov peopl in the world are the spontan we lead such drab live ourselv and keep back so much we like to see a littl niagara of human emot occasion the thorac feel everyth keen life experi make vivid record on the sensit plate of his mind he put them on the victrola that is himself and proceed to run them off for your entertain sometim a bubbler ¶ a constant stream of talk must have been first said in describ this type for while other are care guard their real feel and thought the thorac goe merrili on reliev himself of his more sedat and somber type call the thorac bubbler or spouter just for this reason the incess talker ¶ that person talk get on my nerv is a remark often made by one of the staid stiff type concern the seldom silent extrem florid individu so natur is this to the thorac that he is entir unconsci of the wear effect he has on other peopl a sens of humor ¶ see the funni side of everyth is a capac which come more natur to this type than to other this is due to the psycholog fact that noth is truli humor save what is slight out of plumb real humor lie in detect and describ that intang quirk no type has the sensit essenti to this in ani such degre as the thorac individu of other type sometim possess a keen sens of humor this trait is not confin to the thorac but it is a signific fact that almost everi humorist of note has had this type as the first or second element in his makeup the human firework ¶ he is a skyrocket or she is a firefli are phrase often use to describ that vivaci individu whose adept at reparte put the rest of the crowd in the background these peopl are alway larg or pure thorac they never belong predomin to the fourth type the next time you find such a person note how his eye flash how his color come and goe and the mani indescrib gradat of voic which make him the center of thing he is alway shoot spark said a man recent in describ a florid high chest friend never dull compani ¶ his line may not interest you but the thorac himself is usual interest he is an actual curios to the quiet inexpress peopl who never can fathom how he manag to talk so frank and so fast such a person is seldom dull he is everyth from a condiment to a cocktail and has the same effect on the averag group of more or less drab person live in the height and depth ¶ glad one moment and sad the next is the way the ticker would read if it could make a record of the inner feel of the averag thorac these feel often come and go without his have the least notion of what caus them ordinarili these unaccount mood are due to sensat reach his subconsci mind of which no cogniz is taken by his conscious process call intuit ¶ this abil to get thing to respond quick with his physic reaction while devot his mental one to someth els has obtain for this type the reput of possess more intuit than other sourc of hunch ¶ that there is no such thing as intuit in the old sens of get a hunch from the outsid is now agre by psychologist the thing we have call intuit they maintain is not due to irregular or supernatur caus but to our own normal natur mental process the impress that he get this knowledg or suspicion from the outsid is due the scientist say to the fact that his think has proceed at such lightn like speed that he was unabl to watch the wheel go round the onli thing of which he is conscious is the final result or sum at the bottom of the column call his hunch he is not awar of the addit and subtract which his mind went through to get it for him easili excit ¶ off like a shot is a term often appli to the thorac he is the most easili excit of all type but also the most easili calm he recov from everi mood more quick and more complet than other type under the influenc of emot he often doe thing for which he is sorri immedi afterward on the spur of the moment ¶ this type usual doe a thing quick or not at all he is a gun that is alway cock so he hit a great mani thing in the cours of a lifetim and lead the most excit exist of ani type be abl to get thrill out of the most commonplac event becaus of see element in it which other overlook he find in everyday life more novelti than other ever see the adventur ¶ romanc and adventur alway interest this type he live for thrill and novel reaction and usual spare no pain or money to get them a veri slangi but veri express term use frequent by these peopl is i got a real kick out of that this crave for adventur suspens and zest often lure this type into specul gambl and various game of chanc the danger in fli deep sea dive auto race and similar field has a strong appeal for this typeso strong that practic everi man or woman who follow these profess is of this type tire of same ¶ the thorac soon tire of the same suit the same gown the same hous the same town and even the same girl he wring the utmost out of each experi so quick and so complet that he is forev on the lookout for new world to conquer past experi are to him as so mani lemon out of which he has taken all the juic he anticip those of the futur as so mani more to be util in the same way like respons peopl ¶ we all like answer we want to be assur that what we have said or done has regist the thorac is alway say or do someth and cant understand whi other peopl are so unrespons he is as respons as a radio wire everyth hit the mark with him and he let you know it so natur he enjoy the same from other and consid those less express than himself stiff formal or dull the kind of person the thorac like best is one suffici like himself to nod and smile and show that he fulli understand but who will not interrupt his stream of talk peopl he dislik ¶ the stolid indiffer or cold are peopl the thorac come veri near dislik their evid self complac and immobl are thing he doe not understand at all and with which he has littl patienc such peopl seem to him to be cold unfeel almost dead so he steer clear of them it was sure a thorac who first call these peopl stick but the reason for their act like stick will be appar in anoth chapter his pet avers ¶ wherea the aliment avoid peopl he doe not care for the thorac is inclin to betray his avers he occasion delight to put peopl he dislik at a disadvantag by his wit or satir the stoni individu who walk through life like an ionian pillar is a complet mysteri to the thorac and the pillar return the compliment we do not like anyth we do not understand and we seldom understand anyth that differ decid from ourselv thus we distrust and dislik foreign and to a greater or lesser extent other famili peopl from other section of the countri etc the eastern and western have a natur distrust of each other and the civil war is not the onli reason for the incompat of southern and northern so it is with individu those who differ too wide in type never understand each other they have too littl of the chief thing that build friendshipsemot in common the forgiv man ¶ if you have onc been a real friend of a thorac and a quarrel come between you he may be ever so bitter and bite in the moment of his anger but in most case he will forgiv you eventu realli forget disagr ¶ it is not as easi for other type to forgiv they often refrain from attempt a reconcili but the thorac forgiv is not onli spontan but genuin the aliment bear no grudg becaus it is too much troubl the thorac find it hard to maintain a grudg becaus he get over it just as he get over everyth els his anger ooz away or he wake up some fine morn and find like the boy recov from the chickenpox that he simpli hasnt it ani more diseas he is most suscept to ¶ acut diseas are the one chiefli affect this type everyth in his organ tend to sudden and not to same just as he is inclin to get into and out of psycholog experi quick so he is inclin to sudden ill and to sudden recuper a thorac seldom has ani kind of chronic ailment if he acquir a superabund of avoirdupoi he is in danger of apoplexi the combin of extrem thorac and extrem aliment tendenc is the caus of this diseas like fanci food ¶ varieti and novelti in food are much enjoy by this type the aliment like lot of rich food but he is not so desir of varieti or freak dish but the thorac special in them you can not mention ani kind of strang new dish whose investig wont appeal to some one in the crowd and that person is alway somewhat thorac it give him anoth promis of new foreign dish of all kind depend for their introduct into this countri almost entir upon these florid patron accord to the statement of restauranteur this type say i will tri anyth onc mani cours dinner if the food is good are especi popular with them the trim at dinner ¶ out of the ordinari surround in which to dine are alway welcom to this type the hang pictur and furnitur mean much to him most peopl like music at meal but to the thorac it is almost indispens he is so aliv in everi nerv so key up and has such intens capac for enjoy of mani thing simultan that he demand more than other type an attent waiter who minist to everi movement and anticip everi wish is also a favorit with the thorac when out for dinner sensit to his surround ¶ color surround are more necessari to the thorac than to other type the ever chang fashion in hous decor are welcom innov to him he soon grow tire of a thing regardless of how much he like it to begin with take notic amongst your friend and you will see that the girl who chang the furnitur all around everi few week is invari of this type it make me feel that i have chang my locat and take the place of a trip explain one girl not long ago want someth differ ¶ the exact color of hang wall paper interior decor and accessori are matter of vital import to this type wherea the aliment demand comfort the thorac ask for someth differ someth that catch and hold the eyethat make an instantan impress upon the onlook and give him one more thing by which to rememb the person of the one who live there this type consid his room and home as a part of himself and take the pain with them which he bestow upon his cloth when he is rich ¶ wealth to the thorac mean unlimit opportun for achiev the unusu in everyth his tast are more extravag than those of other type uncommon work of art are usual found in the home of this type the most extraordinari thing from the most extraordinari place are especi prefer with him he carri out his desir for attent here as in everyth els and what he buy will serv that end direct or indirect fashion and flare ¶ flare apt describ the qualiti which the pure thorac desir in all that touch him and his person it must have verv and go and distinct it must be the latest and the thing he is the last type of all to submit to wear last year suit sing last year song or drive in a last year model like dash ¶ the thorac want everyth he wear drive live in or own to get across to make an impress the fat man love comfort abov all els but the florid man love distinct he doe not demand such easi to wear garment as the fat man on the contrari he will undergo extrem discomfort if it give him a distinct appear he want his hous to be eleg the ground differ the view unusu has color sens ¶ wherea the fat man when furnish a home devot his attent to soft bed steam heat and plenti of cushion divan the thorac think of the chandeli the unusu chair the pretti front doorstep the landscap garden and the color scheme when he is in moder circumst ¶ when onli well to do this type will be found to have carri out furnish and decor with the tast worthi of much larger purs when mere well to do he wear the veri best cloth he can possibl afford and often a good deal better this type doe not purpos to be outwit by life he tri alway to put up a good show when he is poor ¶ the thorac is seldom poor he has so much person ginger and go of the sort that is requir in the world of today that he usual has a good posit he may not like the posit but in spite of the fact that he find it harder to toler disagre thing than ani other type he will endur it for he know that the reward he is after can not be had by the down and outer the natur and normal vaniti of the thorac stand him in hand here more than in almost ani other place in life the world entertain by them ¶ behind everi row of foot light you will find more peopl of this type than ani other the aliment manag the world but the thorac entertain it he compris more of the dancer actor operat star and general entertain than ani other two type combin in everyth save acrobat and oratori he hold the platform laurel as alreadi point out his adapt spontan and love of approv are respons for this his fastidi habit ¶ the thorac is the most fastidi of all the type his thin skin and sensit nerv make him more conscious of rough and slovenli than other the result is that he is what is call more particular about his person than are other type the fat man often wear an old pair of shoe long past their use but the florid man think more of the impress he creat than of his own person comfort and will wear the shiniest of patent leather on the hottest day if they are the best match for his suit like all music ¶ everi kind of music is enjoy by the pure thorac becaus he experi so mani mood entertain he prefer ¶ social affair of an exclus order where he wear his best bib and tucker and everybodi els doe the same are amongst the favorit divers of this type he make a favor impress under such condit and is well awar of it other reason for this prefer are his brilliant convers power his charm and his enjoy of other peopl and their view point the thorac is also exceed fond of danc enjoy vaudevill ¶ the averag thorac enjoy vaudevill folli revu etc becaus they are full of quick chang of program he enjoy as doe everi type certain kind of movi but he constitut no such percentag of the movi go audienc as some other type read ¶ book and stori that are romant adventur and differ are the favorit of this type detect stori are often in high favor with him also physic asset ¶ the physic advantag of this type are his quick energybas on his wonder breath systemand the rich rapid flow blood produc by his wonder heart system he is note for his abil to get his second wind and has remark capac for rise to sudden physic emerg physic liabil ¶ a tendenc to over excit and the consequ run down of his batteri is a physic pitfal often fatal to this type favorit sport ¶ hurdl sprint tenni and all sport requir short intens spurt of energi are the one in which this type excel social asset ¶ charm and respons are the chief social asset of the thorac inasmuch as these are the most valuabl of all social trait he has a better natur start in human relationship than ani other type social liabil ¶ quick temper his inflamm natur and appear of vaniti are his greatest social liabil they stand between him and success mani time he must learn to control them if he desir to reap the full benefit of his remark asset emot asset ¶ instantan sympathi and the lack of poison inhibit are the outstand emot asset of this type emot liabil ¶ impati mercuri emot and the expenditur of too much of his electr in everi littl experi are the tendenc most to be guard against busi asset ¶ that he is a good mixer and has the magnet to interest and attract other are his most valuabl busi trait busi liabil ¶ an appear of flighti and his tendenc to hop from one subject to anoth stand in the way of the thorac promot mani time domest strength ¶ the abil to entertain and pleas his own famili and to give of himself to them as freeli as he give himself to the world at larg is one of the most lovabl thorac trait domest weak ¶ the tempera and temper of this type constitut a real domest problem for those who live with them but they are so forgiv themselv that it is almost imposs to hold anyth against them should aim at ¶ the thorac should aim at make fewer decis at finish what he start and of wast less energi in unnecessari word and motion should avoid ¶ all situat condit and peopl who slip the belt off the will who tend to cut life up into bit by dissip or pleasur seek should be avoid by this type becaus they aggrav his own weak in that direct strong point ¶ person ambit adapt and quick physic energi are the strongest point of the thorac weakest point ¶ too great excit irrespons and supersensit are the weakest point of this type how to deal with this type social ¶ give him esthet surround encourag him to talk and respond to what he say these are the certain method for win him in social intercours how to deal with this type in busi ¶ get his name on the dot line now or dont expect it if he is an employe let him come into direct contact with peopl give his person a chanc to get busi for you dont forget to prais him when deserv and dont pin him down to routin this type succeed best in profess where his person charm can be capit and doe not belong in ani strict commerci busi rememb the chief distinguish mark of the thorac in the order of their import are flush complexion high chest and long waist ani person who has these is larg of the thorac type no matter what other type may be includ in his makeup chapter iii the muscular type the worker peopl in whom the muscular system is proportion larger and more high develop than ani of their other system are muscular this system consist of the muscl of the organ the lean meat type ¶ the muscl system of the human bodi is simpli a co ordin organ arrang of layer of lean meat of which everi individu has a complet set an individu muscl may be small flabbi defici in strength or so thin as to be almost impercept but they are alway thereelementari in the infant full grown in the adult and remnant in the age but they are so smooth fit togeth so close knit and usual so well cover that we seldom realiz their complex or import in the pure muscular type his muscl are firm and larg such muscl can not be disguis but seem to stand out all over him helpless without them ¶ without them we would be helpless mass of fat and bone we could not blink an eye nor lift a finger yet we are so accustom to them that we rare think of them and seldom give them credit for what they do without their wonder work to adjust the eye we could not see without their power the heart would ceas to beat we can not smile sob speak nor sing without use them we would have no pianist violinist dancer aviat inventor or worker of ani kind without them everyth we put togetherfrom hook and eye to skyscrapersi plan by our brain but depend for it materi upon the muscl of the human bodi how to know him ¶ look at ani individu and you will note one of these three condit that his bone seem to be cover just by skin and sinew which mean that he belong to the fourth type or thick pad with fat in which case he is larg of the first type or well upholst with firm meat in the latter case he is larg muscular no matter what other type may be present in his makeup in a short time you will be abl to tell at a glanc whether the pad on an individu is most fat or most muscl becaus fat is alway round and soft while muscl is firm and definit physic solid ¶ a general solid of structur as distinguish from the soft of the aliment and the resili of the thorac character the muscular see chart 5 poke your finger into a fat man hand and though it make a dent that dent puff back quick do the same to the muscular and you will find a firm and tough of fiber that resist but stay there longer onc the dent is made not so malleabl ¶ this littl illustr is typic of the differ between these two natur throughout their entireti just as the fat man face give to your touch he will give in to you more easili than ani other type but he will go back to the same place sooner and more smooth when your pressur is remov illustr 5 muscular the worker the muscular doe not mold so easili is less suggest is less tractabl than the aliment or thorac but is less like to revert afterward built on the squar ¶ on the squar is a figur express usual appli to a moral tendenc in this sens it is as often possess by one type as anoth but in a pure liter sens the muscular is actual built on the squar his whole figur is a combin of squar the aliment is built upon the circl the thorac on the kite shape but the pure muscular alway tend toward a squar of outlin we repeat he is no more squar moral than ani other type so do not make the mistak of attribut ani more of this virtu to him than to other ¶ each type has it own weak and point of strength as differenti from other type and these are respons for most of the moral differ between peopl no type superior moral ¶ sinc moral weak come from type weak and sinc each type possess about as mani weak as the other it follow that no type is superior moral to ani other and no type is moral inferior to ani other type and temptat ¶ moral is most a matter of how much temptat you can withstand everi individu in a civil communiti is surround by temptat of some kind most of the time he doe not want to yield to ani of them everi man and woman doe the best of which his particular type is capabl under a given circumst each individu resist mani temptat for which we fail to give him credit he yield onli to those which make such a strong appeal to his type that he lack the power of resist in other word each person yield to the temptat that prey upon his particular weak and what his weak are will depend upon his type in the grip of these temptat he may commit anyth from discourtesi to crimeaccord to the strength of the temptat plus his own lean in that direct on the other hand certain immor which appeal strong to some type have no attract whatev for other and these latter get credit for a virtuous that has cost them noth prais and punish ¶ on the other hand each one of the five human type has certain point of strength and from these get it natur moral qualiti we spend a great deal of energi give prais and blame but when we realizea we are do more and morethat the type of an individu is respons for most of his act we will give less of both to the individu and more of both to the creator type vs train ¶ the most that train can do is to brace up the weak spot in us to cultiv the strong one to teach us to avoid inim environ and to constant remind us of the penalti we pay whenev we digress child train ¶ as this great scienc of human analysi becom known the world will understand for the first time how the other half live and whi it live that way we will know whi one child just natur tell fib while his twin brother under ident train just natur tell the truth what is more to the point we will know this in their childhood and be prepar to give to each the kind of train which will weed out his worst and bring out his best short and stocki ¶ the extrem muscular type see chart 5 is below medium height though one of ani height may be larg muscular the extrem type of which we are treat in this chapter is shorter and heavier than the averag but his heavi is due to muscl instead of fat he has the appear of stand firm solid upon the ground of be stalwart and strong the squar shoulder man ¶ the muscular shoulder stand out more near at right angl than those of ani other type and are much broader in proport to his height the aliment has slope shoulder and the thorac inclin to high shoulder but the shoulder of the pure muscular are straighter and have a squar where the aliment have curv this account for the fact that most of the squar shoulder men you have known were not tall men but medium or below medium in height the wide squar shoulder do not accompani ani other pure type though natur they may be present in an individu who is a combin has proportion long arm ¶ the arm of pure muscular are longer in proport to the bodi than the arm of other type the arm of the aliment are short for his bodi but the extrem muscular arm are alway anywher from slight longer to veri much longer than his height would lead you to expect the pure muscular head ¶ a squar head is the first thing you think of when you look at a pure muscular his head has no such decid digress from the normal as the round head of the aliment or the kite shape head of the thorac it is not high for his bodi like the thorac nor small for his bodi like the aliment but is of averag proport illustr 6 typic muscular face typic muscular hand his thick neck ¶ a distinct featur of this type is his thick neck it is not fat like that of the aliment nor medium long like that of the thorac but has unusu muscular and strength this is one of the chief indic of the muscular strength a sturdi neck is one of the most signific indic of physic prowess and longev while the frail neckof which we shall speak in connect with the fifth typei alway a sign of the physic frailti which endang life the thick of his neck may sometim give you the impress that the muscular head is small but if you will look again you will see that it is normal for his bodili size his squar face ¶ look at him from direct in front you will see that the muscular face give you an impress of squar see chart 6 you will also notic that his side head cheek and jaw run up and down in such a way as to give him a right angl face his squar jaw ¶ a broad jaw is anoth characterist of this type not onli is it squar look at from the front but you are pretti sure to note that the jaw bone as they proceed downward under the ear tend to make a right angl turn at the corner instead of a round curv these dimens tend to give the whole lower part of the muscular face a box like appear it is consid becom to men but rob it femal owner of the delic point chin so much desir by women the typic muscular hand ¶ notic the hand of the peopl you meet and you will be surpris to see how differ and how interest they are their size shape and structur as seen from the back of the hand are especi signific and tell us much more about the individu natur than the palm doe perhap you have thought that a hand was just a hand but there are hand and hand each pure type has it own and no other is ever seen on the extrem of that type the hand of the muscular like all the rest of his bodi is built in a seri of squar it run out from the wrist and down in a straighter line and tend to right angl see chart 6 the squar finger of this type ¶ spatul fingersmean finger that are squar or paddl shape at the tipsar sure indic of a decid muscular tendenc he may have other type in combin but if his finger are realli squaresaw off at the end in such a way as to give them larg instead of taper endsthat person has more than averag muscular and the activ of his life will tend in the direct refer to in this chapter the manual worker ¶ muscular are the hand worker of the world they are the artisan craftsmen the constructor and builder we all tend to use most those organ or part of the bodi which are largest and most high develop the muscular hand is proportion larger than the hand of ani other type it has more muscl that one element without which good hand work is imposs so it has follow inevit that the manual work of the world is done larg by muscular their hand are also so much more power that they do not tire easili the hand of the creativ artist ¶ the artist hand and the artist hand are phrase long use but misus delic taper finger were suppos in ancient time to denot artist abil the frail curv hand was also suppos to be a sign of artist talent from the stage of old down to the movi of today the typic artist is pictur with a slight slender hand this taper finger hand denot a keen sens of artist valu a love of the esthet refin and beauti and real artist appreci but not the abil to creat the hand art ¶ befor we explain this kind understand that we are speak onli of those art which requir hand workand not of such art as sing danc or music composit which could more proper be call artist activ we are refer onli to those art which depend for their creation upon the human handsuch as paint architectur craftsmanship cartoon sculptur violin piano etc all these are creat by squar finger peopl we are too much inclin to think of the product of these art as be creat out of sheer artist sens artist tast or artist insight but a moment reflect will show that everi tangibl artist creation is the result of unusu hand work combin with gift head work without a sure strong well knit hand the idea of the greatest artist could never have materi the lack of such a hand explain whi the esthet the artist mind and the connoisseur do not creat the beauti thing they appreci head and hand partner ¶ the hand must execut what the brain plan and it must be so perfect a mechan for this that it respond to the most elus inspir of the artist it must be a fifti per cent partner els it owner will never produc real art no type has this strong sure co ordin hand machin to ani such degre as the muscular the finger end which are of the utmost signific in the creation of artist thing must be fit with well develop muscl of extrem effici or the execut will fall short of the ideal pictur in the artist mind the pure muscular type seldom make an artist for after all inspir brain work is the other import element in the creation of art and this is the fort of the fifth type a combin of the fifth type with the muscular make most hand artist a combin of the muscular and thorac make most singer everi hand artist will be found to have spatul finger handsin short muscular hand the hand of the famous craftsman pianist sculptor and painter instead of be more frail and delic is alway larger and heavier than that of the averag person such a hand is a certain indic of the muscular element in that individu makeup his power movement ¶ forc decis movement also character this type he is inclin to go at even the most trivial thing with as much forc as if the world depend on it recent we were exhibit a small pencil sharpen to a muscular friend it was so sharp that it perform it work without pressur but she took hold of it as if it were a piec of artilleri and push the pencil into it with all the forc she had when we remonstr smilinglyfor her face and hand are ultra squaresh said but i cant do anyth light i just natur put that much forc into everyth his forc walk ¶ heavi power forc stride distinguish the walk of this type if he has but ten step to go he will start off as if begin an around the world marathon you hear him come ¶ all muscular notifi peopl by their walk of their approach they are unconsci of this loud incis tread and most of them will be surpris to read it here but their friend will recogn it the chanc are that they have often spoken of it amongst themselv the loud voic ¶ the steam calliop voic belong almost alway to a muscular he doe his talk just as he doe everyth elsewith all his might it is veri difficult for the muscular to tone down this power voic his long suffer friend will testifi to this characterist his stentorian tone ¶ this loud voic is a serious social handicap to him his onli chanc of compens for it lie in it use befor juri congreg or larg audienc it might be note here that everi great orat has been larg of this type and also that his fame came not alon from the thing he said but from the stentorian tone in which he said them famous male singer ¶ caruso john mccormack and all other famous male singer had larg thorac system but in everi instanc it was combin with a larg muscular develop the solid sitter ¶ when a muscular sit down he doe it as he doe everythingwith definit and forc he doe not spill over as doe the aliment nor drape himself grace like the thorac but plank himself as though he meant busi activ his keynot ¶ becaus he is especi built for it the muscular is more activ than ani other type without muscl no organ could move itself from the spot in which it was born biolog teach us that the stomach was the first thing evolv the origin one call organ possess but one functiondigest as life progress it becam necessari to send nutriment to those part of the organ not touch by the stomach for the purpos of reach these suburb there was involv the circulatori or thorac system and this gave rise as we have seen in the previous chapter to the thorac type movement and develop ¶ as time went on movement becam necessari full develop not be possibl to ani static organ to meet this need muscl were evolv and organ life began to move it was onli a wiggl at first but that wiggl has grown till today it includ everi kind of labor globe trot and immigr the muscular is fit with the best travel equip of ani type and invari live a life whose main reaction express these thing the immigr muscular ¶ no matter what his work or play the muscular will make more move dure the cours of a day than other type he love action becaus his muscl be over equip for it keep urg him from within to do thing as a result this type make up most of the immigr of the world italian pole greek russian german and jew are larg of this type and these are the race furnish the largest number of foreign in america inert irk him ¶ shut up a muscular and you destroy him his big muscl system cri out for someth to do he becom restless nervous and ill when confin or compel to be idl the aliment love an easi time but the muscular dislik eas except when exhaust even then it is almost imposs to stop him must be do someth ¶ i cant bear to be do noth you often hear peopl say such a person alway has plenti of muscl muscular want to feel that they are not wast time they must be up and do accomplish someth if there is noth near them that need do they are sure to go and find someth the born worker ¶ work is second natur to this type he realli prefer it everyon like some kind of work when in the mood if it serv a purpos or an ideal but the muscular like work for it own sakeor rather for the activ sake work pall on the aliment and monotoni on the thorac but leisur is what pall on the muscular he may have work ten year without a vacat and he may imagin he want a long one but by the morn of the third day you will notic he has found a piec of work for himself it may be noth more than hang the screen door chop the wood or dust the furnitur but it will furnish him with some kind of activ becaus he enjoy action for it own sake and becaus work is onli appli action this type make the best worker he can be trust to work harder than ani other type requir less watch ¶ it is no accid that the three hundr men gang of foreign workmen who dig ditch tunnel and tube construct build railroad and citi work with fewer foremen and supervisor than are ordinarili requir to keep much smaller forc of other employe at their post seldom unemploy ¶ for this reason the muscular is seldom out of work he is in demand at the best current wage becaus he can be depend upon to keep at it ¶ while write this book our window overlook a public park in one of america one million popul citi hundr of unemploy men sleep there day and night have occas to pass through this park daili for sever month it has been interest to note the type predomin hard one per cent belong to the muscular type like to do thing ¶ becaus he is such a hard worker this type get a good deal of prais and glori just as the fat peopl who manag to get out of work receiv a good deal of blame yet work is almost as pleasant to the muscular as leisur is to the aliment the muscular pugnac ¶ fightersthos who realli enjoy a scrap occasionallyar invari muscular their squar jawsth sure sign of great muscularityar famous the world over and especi so in these day when war is onc more in fashion the next time you look at the front face of persh haig hindenberg or even that of your traffic policeman note the extrem muscular face and jaw combat or person fight is a matter of muscl action be well equip for it this type actual enjoy it that is whi he is often in troubl than ani other type it was no accid that the phrase big stick was the slogan of an almost pure muscular love the strenuous life ¶ the strenuous life was anoth of roosevelt pet phrase and came from the natur lean of his type the true muscular is natur strenuous becaus we are prone to advis other to do what we enjoy do ourselv it was inevit that so strenuous a man as t r should advoc wholesal univers and almost compulsori strenuos we tell other to do certain thing becaus it will do you good but the real reason usual is that we like to do it ourselv the acrobat type ¶ the next time you go to a vaudevill show get there in time for the acrobat and notic how all the particip are muscular if there are ani other type take part pleas observ that they are secondari to the acrobatsthey catch the handkerchief or otherwis act as foil for the real perform all the hard work in the act will be done by muscular you will find no better exampl of the short stocki well knit pure muscular than here you do not need to wait for anoth show to realiz how true this is recal the form and height of all the acrobat you have ever seen you will rememb that there was not one who did not fit the descript of the pure muscular given at the begin of this chapter acrobat alway muscular ¶ we onc had occas to refer to this fact in a human analysi class one member declar that just that week he had seen a veri tall unmuscular man perform in an acrobat act at the orpheum know that this was imposs we offer a larg reward to this member if he were proven right we sent to the theater and found the acrobat in question he had just finish his act and kind consent to come over he turn out to be a pure muscular as we had state the class member mistak came from the fact that the acrobat appear taller than he realli was high platform alway give this illus furthermor his partner in the act was of diminut height and the acrobat look tall and slender by contrast whi they dont do it ¶ to be an acrobat is the ambit of almost everi boy there have been few who did not dream while do those stunt in the haymow on mother broomstick of the glori that should be their when they grew up and perform in red tight for the multitud almost everi boy has this ambit becaus he pass through a stage of decid muscular develop in his earli year but onli those who were born with much larger muscl than the averag ever carri out their dream the other soon develop girth or the sit still habit to the point where a cushion seat in the first row of the parquet look much better durabl in cloth ¶ someth that will wear well is what this type ask for when he drop in to buy a suit muscular are not parsimoni nor stingi their buy the most durabl in everyth is not so much to save money as for the purpos of have someth they do not need to be afraid to handl like heavi materi ¶ this type like heavi stabl materi wherea the aliment want comfort cloth and the thorac distinct one the muscular want wearabl everyday cloth he want the materi to be of the best but he care less for color than the thorac qualiti rather than style and plain rather than pretti are his standard in dress make over father pant for johnni is a job muscular women have excel in and for which they have becom famous for this type of mother not onli see to it that father pant are of the kind of stuff that wont wear out easili but she has the squar creativ hand that enjoy construct the plain dresser ¶ simpl dressesblu serg for instancear the one the muscular woman like this type care littl about cloth as ornament he is intent on get his desir satisfi by do thing not by look them he also resent the time and troubl that fashion dress demand no matter how much money this type has he will not be inclin to extrem in dress muscular are not realli interest in cloth for cloth sake it is not that this type is unambiti he is extrem so but he is so concentr on get thing done that he is like to forget how he look while do them when a person of this type doe take great pain with his cloth it is alway for a purpos and not becaus he enjoy preen himself there is littl of the peacock in the muscular a simpl soul ¶ muscular are the most democrat of all the type the thorac is a natur aristocrat and enjoy the feel of a littl innoc superior but muscular often refus to take advantag of superior posit gain through wealth or station and are inclin to treat everybodi as an equal it is almost imposs for this type even though he may have becom or have been born a millionair to lord it over servant or subordin he is given to back democrat movement of all kind this explain whi muscular constitut the larg major in everi radic group human his hobbi ¶ be human is an ideal to which this type adher with almost religi zeal he like the commonplac thing and is never a follow after the thing though he has no prejudic against it as the fourth type has an everyday individu ¶ the muscular doe not care for show and except when essenti to the success of his aim seldom doe anyth for appear he is not an easi go companion like the aliment nor a scintil one like the thorac but an everyday sort of person when in troubl ¶ this type is not given to slide out of difficulti like the aliment nor to be temporarili submerg by them like the thorac he stand up to them and back them down when in troubl he act instead of mere think the most practic type ¶ the practicalist is often use to describ this type he is inclin to look at everyth from the standpoint of it practic and is neither stingi nor extravag he like what work ¶ will it work is the question this type put to everyth if it wont though it be the most fascin or the most divert thing in the world he will take littl interest in it this type depend most upon his own hand and head to make his fortun for him and is seldom lure into risk money on thing he has not seen the natur effici expert ¶ the shortest surest way is the one this type like he is not inclin to fussi he

he know it in the begin but bewar of rais it afterward the muscular is serious in busi not a jollier like the aliment nor a thriller like the thorac and he want you to be the same rememb the chief distinguish mark of the muscular in the order of their import are larg firm muscl a squar jaw and squar hand ani person who has these is larg of the muscular type no matter what other type may be includ in his makeup chapter iv the osseous type the stayer men and women in whom the osseous or boni framework of the bodi is more high develop than ani other system are call the osseous type this system consist of the bone of the bodi and make what we call the skeleton just as the previous system were develop dure man biolog evolut for purpos serv the need of the organismfirst a stomach sack then a freight system in the form of arteri to carri the food to remot part of the bodi and later muscl with which to move itself aboutso this boni scaffold was develop to hold the bodi upright and better enabl it to defend and assert itself illustr 7 osseous the stayer man is a creatur who in spite of his height walk erect he can so do onli by mean of the support given him by his boni framework the human bodi is like a tall buildingth muscl are like the mortar and plaster the bone are like the steel framework around which everyth els is built and without which the structur could not stand upright how to know him ¶ promin ankl wrist knuckl and elbow are sure sign that such an individu has a larg osseous or boni element in his makeup when you look at ani person you quick discern whether fat bone or muscl predomin in his construct if fat predomin he lean toward the aliment no matter what other type he may have in combin if firm well defin muscl are conspicu he is larg muscular but if his bone are proportion larg for his bodi he has much of the osseous type in his makeup the raw bone man ¶ raw bone exact describ the appear of the extrem osseous see chart 7 such a man is a contrast to other in ani group and a figur with which all of us are familiar but that his inner natur differ as wide from other as his extern appear differ from their is someth onli recent discov as we proceed through this chapter you will be interest to note how everi trait attribut to this type appli with absolut accuraci to everi extrem raw bone angular person you have ever known you will also notic how these trait have predomin in everi person whose bone were larg for his bodi though this type was the last to be classifi by scienc it is the most extrem of them all physic rigid ¶ an impress of physic rigid is given by the extrem osseous such a man or woman look stabl unchang immovablea though he could take a stand and keep to it through thick and thin so vivid do veri tall angular raw bone peopl convey this impress that they are seldom approach by beggar bark at by street vendor or told to step live his size look formid ¶ the power of his physiqu is evid to all who look at him the strength indic by his larg joint angular hand and general bulk intuit warn other to let this kind of person alon he is therefor unmolest for the most part whether he walk down the street of his home town or wander the byway of danger vicin his rugged ¶ this type also look rug he remind us of the rug rocki he appear firm fix impassivea though everyth about him was perman extern are not accident they alway correspond to the intern natur in everi form of life and it is not accident that the osseous look all of these thing he is all of them as definit as they can be express in human natur the steadi man ¶ of all human type the osseous is the most depend and reliabl the phrase that man is steadi never fli off the handl alway the same etc are invari use concern those of more than averag boni structur immov his keynot ¶ the keynot of the boni man whole naturement physic and morali immov onc he settl into a place of ani kinda town a home or even a chairh is disinclin to move he doe not settl as quick as other type but when he doe it is for a longer stay think how differ he is from other in this psycholog trait and how it coincid exact with his physiolog structur the fat man let you make temporari dent in his plan just as you make them in a piec of fat meat but the boni man is exact the opposit just as bone is difficult to twist or turn or alter in ani way it take a long time and much effortbut onc it is chang it is there for good the six footer ¶ becaus ani individu height is determin by his skeleton extrem tall is a sign of a larger than averag boni structur the extrem osseous is therefor tall but you must rememb that larg joint are more signific than height even when found in short peopl they indic a larg osseous tendenc larg bone for his bodi ¶ so bear in mind that ani person whose bone are larg for his bodi is somewhat of the osseous type regardless of whether he is short or tall and regardless of how much fat or muscl he may have the larg joint person when fat is an osseous aliment a larg joint man of muscl would be an osseous muscular the small osseous ¶ a veri short person then may be predomin osseous if his bone are proportion larg for his bodi such an individu is call a small osseous a head that is high for his bodi and inclin to be straight up and down goe with the extrem osseous type see chart 8 it doe not resembl a sphere like the aliment is not kite shape like the thorac nor squar like the muscular it is higher than ani of the other stand on a longer more angular neck and his adam appl is usual in evid the pioneer type ¶ like each of the other type the osseous is a result of a certain environ rigor remot region requir just such peopl and these final gave rise to this stoical natur the outpost of civil are respons for his evolut illustr 8 a typic osseous face b typic osseous hand pioneer with it hardship it menac cold and dearth of comfort in far countri at last produc a man who could stand them who could live through almost anyth and still domin his surround not a softi ¶ the osseous doe not give way to his feel he keep his grief sorrow ambit and most of his real opinion to himself he is the farthest from a softi of ani type if you desir to know at onc what kind of person the osseous is put the aliment and thorac type togeth and mix them thorough the osseous is the opposit of that mixtur each and everi trait he possess is one whose exact opposit you will find in one or the other of these first two type consist in type ¶ as we go on in this chapter you will see whi all kind of peopl make up the world for natur has outdon herself in the distinct between the five human type each type is made up of certain group of trait with which we have come in contact all our live but which we have never classifi and each set of trait compris a type has a consist which noth less than mother natur could have produc you will be interest to see how accur are the statement concern each type and how they are proven again and again in everi type you associ with guesswork is no longer necessari in the size up of stranger you can know them better than their mother know them if you will get these nutshel of fact clear in your mind and then appli them his high cheek bone ¶ cheek bone stand higher than the averag are alway indic either of a larg thorac or a larg osseous element if the distanc between the cheek is so wide as to make this the widest section of the face it is probabl that the person is more thorac than osseous but if his face is narrow across the cheek bone and especi if it run perpendicular down to the jaw corner from that point instead of taper the person is larg of the osseous type built on the oblong ¶ an oblong is what the osseous bring to mind his bodi outlin approxim the oblonga squar plus length he is full of right angl and sharp corner see chart 7 his face is built on the oblong see chart 8 and if you will notic the side head of the next osseous man you meet you will see that even a side view present more near the appear of the oblong than of ani other geometr figur the oblong hand ¶ the gnarl hand well describ that of the osseous the hand outlin of this type also approxim the oblong see chart 8 it run straight down instead of taper when the finger are held close togeth the hand of the osseous match his bodi head and face it is boni angular larg joint and as rigid as it look the inflex of his hand is alway appar in his handshak knotti finger ¶ knotti finger character the hand of this type their irregular appear come from the size of the joint which are larg in keep with all the joint run throughout his organ everyth in one of natur creatur match the other part agassiz the great naturalist when given the scale of a fish could reconstruct for you the complet organ of the type of fish from which it came give a tree leaf to a botanist and he will reconstruct the size shape structur and color of the tree back of it he will describ to you it nativ environ and it function what it bark blossom and branch look like and what to do to make it grow no guesswork in natur ¶ natur has no accid with her everyth is organ everyth has a purpos and everi part of a thing insid and out match the whole so the hand of the osseous and the face of the osseous match the bodi and head this is also true of everi other type the aliment has small fat dimpl hand and feet like his bodi the thorac has taper hand and feet to match his face and bodi the muscular bodi hand and feet are all squar but the osseous has a boni bodi so his hand and feet are equal boni the man of slow movement ¶ he is too slow for me you have heard some one say of anoth perhap you heard it said today review the outward appear of all the peopl you know who have this reput from those of your earliest childhood down to that person of whom it was spoken todayand you will find that everi one of them resembl the boni type we have just been describ look back and call to mind the appear of all the rapid one and you will find that in everi case they possess high color high chest or high bridg nose take anoth look for the easi go amen one and see how plump they all were the straight lace ¶ none of these thing just happen they are the result of the law of caus and effect the connect between extern and intern trait is becom clearer everi day and reveal some veri unexpect thing one that has been discov veri recent is that the straight face are the straight lace notic for yourself and you will find that everi person who is realli straight lace is a person with a straight facethat is a face with straighter up and down line than the averag think back over those you have known who come under this head and you will find no actual round face peopl amongst them no matter how sanctimoni religi or correct a person may act when his posit or the occas demand it if he has a round moon face he is not realli straight lace at heart ani one who know him well enough to know his real natur will tell you so the natur convent ¶ the born puritan the ascet and the natur convent person is on the other hand invari an individu of more sever facial outlin this person may be in an unconvent posit your straight face sever line person may be a gambler a boot legger or follow ani other line defi the convent but he is at heart a conserv after all for instanc you will alway find when you know him that he doe thing in a way that is veri convent to him that is he has decid standard rule habit and requir and he cling rigid to them in the transact of his busi regardless of how lax the busi itself may be a certain way of do thing mean as much to him at heart as it mean littl to the circular face peopl systemat and method ¶ a place for everyth and everyth in it place is a rule preach and practis by peopl of this type the osseous person doe not mislay his thing he know so well where they are that he can go straight to them in the dark such a man is care of his tool and keep his work bench or desk shipshap a woman of this type is an excel housekeep her sew basket dresser drawer and pantri shelv are all systemat arrang in appl pie order the typic new england housewif who wash on monday iron on tuesday and bake on saturday for forti year is a direct descend of the puritan most of whom belong to this boni pioneer type the stiff sitter ¶ extrem osseous peopl are inclin to be somewhat formal in their movement they make fewer motion than ani other type they do not wave their hand or arm about when talk and are almost devoid of gesticul of ani kind they sit upright instead of slump down in their chair except when tall and lanki and usual prefer straight back to rocker the osseous walk ¶ the extrem raw bone person has also a formal gait his walk like all his other movement is inclin to be deliber and somewhat mechan ¶ noth about the five type is more interest than the walk which distinguish each the aliment undul or roll along the thorac is an impuls walker and the muscular is forc in his walk but the osseous walk mechan deliber and refus to hurri or speed up the natur pois ¶ the osseous has more natur pois than ani other type he is not impression excit or arous thing do not stir him up as they do other peopl he is more self contain self control and self suffici than ani other he is not easili carri off his feet and seldom yield to impuls it is difficult to get him to do anyth on the spur of the moment he usual has his even sunday and vacat all plan in advanc and wont chang his schedul not given to nerv ¶ liter as well as figur the osseous is not a man of nerv everi fiber of his be is less suscept to outsid stimuli than that of other type in this he is the exact opposit of the thorac whose nerv as we have point out are so fine organ that he is hypersensit resist chang ¶ osseous peopl do not chang anyth from their hair dress to their mind ani often than necessari when they do it is for what they consid overpow good reason these peopl are not flighti they have their work their time and their live laid out systemat and do not allow trivial to upset them they take a longer time to deliber on a propos line of action but onc they have made a decis adher to it with much greater tenac than ani other type the constant ¶ peopl of this type are not fickl nor flirtati they love few but onc have becom enamor are not easili turn asid it is this type that remain true to one love through mani year sometim for life the implac ¶ the osseous are not prone to sudden outburst of temper but they have the unbend kind when it is arous never forgiv and never forget is a trait of these peopl as contrast with the thorac the aliment avoid those he doe not like and forget them becaus it is too much bother to hate the thorac flame up one moment and forgiv the next the muscular take it out in a fight then and there or argu with you about it but the osseous despis hate and loathesand keep on for year after everi one els has forgotten all about it the rock bound puritan type as stoni as the new england land from which it get it live is alway boni the implac father who turn his child away from home with order never to darken his door again alway has a lot of bone in his structur those who refus to be soften into forgiv by the year are alway of this type not adapt ¶ it is difficult for the osseous to fit in he is not adapt and in this is onc again the opposit of the thorac it is imposs for him to adjust himself quick to peopl or place becaus he is unyield unbend and unadjust he is call sot in his way he should not be misjudg for this inadapt howev for it is as natur to him as smooth is to the aliment and impuls to the thorac he is made that way and is no more to blame for it than you are for have brown eye instead of blue the one track man ¶ singl track mind are characterist of this type they get an idea or an attitud and it is there to stay they think the same thing for mani year and follow a few definit line of action most of their live but it is to be rememb in this connect that this type often accomplish more through his intens concentr than more versatil type while they follow mani by path in search of their goal the osseous stick to the main track the born specialist ¶ this one thing i do is a motto of the osseous they are the least versatil of ani type and do not like to jump from one kind of work to anoth they prefer to do one thing at a time do it well and finish it befor start anyth els becaus of this the osseous star in special dislik mani iron in the fire ¶ the man who like mani iron in the fire is never an osseous to have more than one problem befor him at one time make him irrit upset and exasper the most depend type ¶ the unchanging which handicap the osseous in so mani way is respons for one veri admir trait that trait is depend the osseous is reliabl he can be taken at his word more often than ani other type for he live up to it with greater care alway on time ¶ when an osseous person say i will meet you at four oclock at the corner of main and market he will arriv at main and market at four oclock he will not come straggl along nor plead interrupt nor give excus he will be on the exact spot at the exact hour in this he is again a contrast to the first two type an aliment man will roll into the of at a quarter or more like a half hour past the time smile apolog and be so naiv you forgiv and let it go at that the thorac will arriv anywher from five after four to six oclock drown you in a thrill narrat of just how it all happen and never give you a chanc to voic your anger till he has smooth it all out of you an exact man ¶ but the osseous is disdain of such tactic and you had better bewar of use them on him he is depend himself and demand it of othersa littl trait all of us have regard our own particular virtu like respons ¶ respons if it doe not entail too mani differ kind of thought and work is enjoy by the osseous he can be given a task a job a posit and he will attend to it entrust him with a commiss of ani kind from get you a certain kind of thread to discov the north pole and he will come pretti near carri it out if he undertak it finish what he start if an osseous decid to do a piec of work for you you can go ahead and forget all about it no need to advis urg watch inspir coax and cajol him to keep him at it he prefer to keep at a thing if he start it himself you may have to hurri him but you will not have to watch him in order to know he is stick to his task this type start few thing but he bring those few to a pretti success conclus the martyr of the age ¶ die for a caus has been said of mani peopl but those peopl have in everi known instanc been possess of a larger than averag boni structur ¶ the pure aliment seldom troubl his head about caus the thorac is the type that live chiefli for the pleasur of the moment and the adventur of life the muscular fight hard and work hard for various movement but it is the osseous who die for his belief it is the osseous or one who is larg of this type who languish in prison through long year refus to retract he is enabl to do this becaus the ostrac jibe and critic with which other type are final cow have littl effect upon him on the contrari opposit of ani kind whet his determin and make him keep on harder than ever take the opposit side ¶ if you want him to do a thing tell him to do the opposit is a well known rule suppos to work with certain kind of peopl you have wonder whi it sometim work and sometim didnt but it is no mysteri to the student of human analysi when it work the person you tri it on was an osseous or one larg osseous in type and when it didnt he was of some other type contrari complain a man of a boni neighbor recent contrari is his middl name i am open to convict but i would like to see the man who could convinc me is alway said by a man whose type you will be sure to recogn an against ¶ i dont know what it is but im against it is the insid mental attitud of the extrem raw bone angular man or woman they often unconsci refrain from make a decis about a thing till the other fellow make his that settl it they take the other side think back over your school day and call to mind the visag and bodili shape of the boy who was alway on the opposit side who just natur disagre who stood out against the other he was a boni lad everi time rememb the fatti with a face like a full moon did he do such thing he did not he was amen easi go good natur and didnt care how the discuss came out so long as it didnt delay the lunch hour rememb the boy or girl who had the pick of the school for compani whenev there was a parti who danc well and was so sparkl that you alway felt like a pebbl compet against a diamond when they were around that boy or girl had a high chest or high color or a high bridg noseand usual all three but the one you couldnt persuad who couldnt be won over who refus to give in who held up all the unanim vote till everybodi was disgust with him and who rather glori in the distinctionthat boy had big bone and a squar jawth proof that he was a combin of the osseous and muscular type the human balanc wheel ¶ to keep the rest of the world from run away with itself to prevent precipit chang in law custom and tradit has alway been one of the function perform for societi by the boni peopl these peopl are seldom over persuad and be abl to retain a perpendicular posit while the rest of the world is be sway this way and that they act as societi balanc wheel the osseous chang after a while but it is a long while and by the time he doe the rest of the world has march on to someth new which he oppos in it turn wear same style ten year ¶ even the cloth worn by this type tell the same stori style may come and style may go but the osseous goe on forev wear the same line and the same general fashion he wore ten year befor if you will recal the men who continu wear loos roomi suit long after the skin tight fashion came in or the women who kept to long full skirt when short one were the vogu you will note that everi one of them had larg joint or long face boni peopl find a kind of collar or hat that just suit and to that hat and that collar they will stick for twenti year disdain the fashion ¶ in everi citi neighborhood and countri crossroad there is alway somebodi who defi the style of today by wear the style of ten year ago everi such person is a boni individualnev under ani circumst a moon face round bodi one in everi case you will find that his face is longer his nose is longer or his jaw and hand are longer than the averageal osseous indic when he is rich ¶ the boni man adher to one style or to one garment is not primarili becaus he wish to save money though save money is an item that he never overlook it is due rather to his inabl to chang anyth about himself in accord with outsid influenc until a long time has elaps doesnt spend money lavish ¶ the osseous is as state at the head of this chapter a stayer and this appli to everyth he wear think say believ and to the way he carri on everi activ of his life no matter how rich he may be he will not buy one kind of car today and anoth tomorrow nor one hous this week and anoth in six week he use his money as all of us do to maintain his type habit and to give freer rein to them not to chang them to ani extent this type like same he like to get acquaint with a thing he never take up fad and is the most conserv of all type unlik the thorac he avoid extrem in everyth and dislik anyth savor of the showi or conspicu not a social star ¶ becaus he dislik display refus to yield to the new fangl fashion of polit societi and find it hard to adapt himself to peopl the man of this type is seldom a social success he is the least of a ladi man of all the type the osseous woman is even less dispos to social life than the osseous man becaus the busi and profession demand which compel men of this type to mingl with their fellow are less urgent with her like the same food ¶ the same yesterday today and forev is the kind of food prefer by this type he seldom order anyth new the tri and true thing he has eaten for twenti five year are his favorit and it is almost imposs to win him away from them i have had bread and milk for supper everi sunday night for thirti year a boni man said to us not long ago mean what he say ¶ the osseous doe not flatter and seldom prais even when he would like to the word do not come easili but when he doe give you a compliment you may know he mean it he is incis and specifica littl too much so to grace modern social intercours where so much is froth a man of few word ¶ a man of few word is alway and invari a man whose bone are larg for his bodi the fat man use up a great mani pleasant suav merri harmless word the thorac inund you with convers the muscular argu declar and state but the osseous alon is spare of his word the hoarder ¶ boni peopl are never lavish with anyth they do not wast anyth nor throw anyth away these are the peopl who save thing and store them away for year against the day when they may find some use for them when they do part with them it is alway to pass them on where they will do some one some good care of money ¶ you never saw a stingi fat man in your life imagin a two hundr pound miser neither have you ever seen a realli stingi man who was red face and high chest nor have you ever found a real muscular who was a tightwad but you have known some peopl who were pretti close with their money and everi one of them was inclin to boni when he is poor ¶ boni men are seldom broke for they are more care of expenditur than ani other type even when they receiv small salari this type of person alway has someth laid by but the extrem osseous never make a million the same caution which prevent his spend much money also prevent the plung that make big money ¶ the osseous care more for money than ani one els this is what has enabl him when combin with some other type to be so success in bankinga busi where you risk the other man money not your own the extrem osseous is never lax or extravag with his money no matter how much he has he never believ in pay ani more for a thing than is necessari take note of the men who carri purs for silver instead of let their chang lie loos in their pocket they are boni everi time fat peopl and florid peopl are the one who let their greenback fall on the floor while pay the cashier fear of the futur ¶ the raini day doesnt worri the fat peopl or the florid one but it is seldom out of the conscious of the boni men and women so they cling to their twenti dollar a week clerkship for year becaus they are afraid to tackl anyth entail risk pay his bill ¶ i had rather trust a boni man than ani other kind is what the credit expert have told us other thing be equal he is the most reliabl type in money matter and pay his bill more prompt ¶ the boni man is one who seldom approach the credit man howev he usual has enough to get the few thing he realli want and if not he wait till he has extrem boni husband give their wive smaller allow in proport to their total incom than ani other type and becaus they are systemat themselv they are more like to ask for report and item as to where it goe the fat husband and the florid husband are the one who give their wive their last cent and never ask what becom of it the repress man ¶ the osseous man or woman is alway somewhat repress unlik the thorac who uncork and bubbl like a champagn bottl he keep the lid on his feel boni peopl are alway more retic than other they invari tell less of their privat or person affair one may live across the hall from a boni man for year without know much about him he is as secret as the thorac is confid and as guard as the aliment is naiv loyal to his few friend ¶ onc your friend alway your friend can be said about the osseous often than ani other type ¶ the osseous doe not make friend easili and is not a mixer but keep his friend for mani year he take to veri few peopl but is exceed loyal to those of his choic the salt of the earth ¶ peopl of the osseous type say littl they do littl for you and they do not gushbut they are alway there when you need them and alway the same they write few letter to you when away and use few word and littl paper when they do they are like to fill everi page to write neat to wast no margin and to avoid flourish their letter seldom requir an extra stamp plan ahead foresight lay plan far into the futur and keep an eye out for breaker ahead financi and otherwis are tendenc which come natur to the osseous he doe not like to wait until the last moment to do a thing he dislik unexpected and emerg of ani kind he is alway prepar for instanc a boni person will think out everi move of a long journey befor board his train week in advanc he will have the schedul mark and put away in his coat pocketand he know just which coat he is go to wear too the longest live ¶ the osseous live longer than ani other type for two reason the first is that his lack of nerv save him from run down his batteri he seldom becom excit and doe not exhaust himself in emot orgi the second is that he habitu under eatsusu becaus he doe not care so much for food as the first three type but quit often becaus he prefer to save the money peopl he dislik ¶ the boni man doe not like peopl who tri to speed him up hurri him or make him chang his habit flashi peopl irrit him but his worst avers are the peopl who tri to dictat to him this type can not be driven the onli way to handl him is to let him think he is have his own way like the submiss ¶ amen peopl who never interfer with him yet lend themselv to his plan desir and eccentr are the favorit of this type diseas he is most suscept to ¶ no diseas can be said to strike the osseous more frequent than ani other type but moodi fearespeci financi fearlong sustain hatr and resent and lack of chang are indirect respons for those diseas which bring about the end in the major of case music he like ¶ martial classic music and ballad are favorit with the osseous old time tune and song appeal to him strong jazz which the aliment love is dislik by most boni peopl read he prefer ¶ onli a few kind of read a few favorit subject and a few favorit author are indulg in by this type he will read as long as twenti five year on one subject master it and ignor practic everyth els when he becom enamor of an author he read everyth he write read that point direct to some particular thing he is realli interest in make up mani of his book and magazin he is the kind of man who read the same newspap for half a centuri physic asset ¶ his great endur capac for withstand hardship indiffer to weather and his sane under eat habit are the chief physic asset of this type physic liabil ¶ this type has no physic characterist which can be call liabil except the tendenc to chronic diseas even in this he run true to formslow to acquir and slow to cure his favorit sport ¶ hike and golf are the favorit sport of this type becaus these demand no sudden spurt of energi he like them becaus they can be carri on with deliber and independ he doe not care for ani sport involv team work or quick respons to other player except when combin with the thorac type he especi avoid tenni favorit entertain ¶ serious play in which his favorit actor appear are the entertain prefer by this type he care least of all for vaudevill social asset ¶ the osseous has no trait which can proper be call social asset his general upright come nearest to stand him in good stead social howev social liabil ¶ stiff retic physic awkward and the inabl to pose or to prais are the chief social handicap of this type emot asset ¶ the osseous is not emot and can not be said to possess ani asset that are pure emot emot liabil ¶ the lack of emot fervor and enthusiasm prevent this type from impress other busi asset ¶ keep his word orderli and system are the chief busi asset of this type busi liabil ¶ a disinclin to mix the inabl to adapt himself to his patron and a tendenc to hold peopl too rigid to account are the busi handicap of the osseous domest strength ¶ constanc and faith are his chief domest asset domest weak ¶ tight with money a tendenc to be too exact and dictatori and to fail to show affect are the thing that frequent prevent marriag for the osseous and endang it when he doe marri should aim at ¶ the osseous should aim at be more adjust to peopl and to his environ in general he should tri to take a greater interest in other and then show it should avoid ¶ indiffer and the display of it solitud and too few interest are thing the osseous need to avoid his strong point ¶ depend honesti economi faith and his capac for finish what he start are the strongest point of this type his weakest point ¶ stubborn obstinaci slow over cautious cold and a tendenc to stingi are the weakest link in peopl of the extrem osseous type how to deal with this type social ¶ there is littl to be done with the osseous when you meet him social except to let him do what he want to do dont interfer with him if you want him to like you how to deal with this type in busi ¶ as an employe give him respons and then let him alon to do it his way then keep your hand off dont give him constant advic dont tri to drive him let him be as systemat as he like when deal with him in other busi way reli on him and let him know you admir his depend rememb the distinguish mark of the osseous in the order of their import are proportion larg bone for the bodi promin joint and a long face ani person who has these is larg of the osseous type no matter what other type may be includ in his makeup chapter v the cerebr type the thinker all those in whom the nervous system is more high develop than ani other are cerebr this system consist of the brain and nerv the name come from the cerebrum or think part of the brain medit imagin dream visual and all voluntari mental process take place in the cerebrum or brain as we shall hereinaft call it the brain is the headquart of the nervous systemit home officejust as the stomach is the home offic of the aliment system and the heart and lung the home offic of the thorac your freight system ¶ the thorac system may be compar to a great freight system with each of it tributariesfrom the main trunk arteri down to the tiniest blood vesselsstart from the heart and carri it cargo of blood to everi part of the bodi by mean of the power furnish by the lung your telegraph system ¶ but the nervous system is more like an intric telegraph system it network of nerv run from everi out point of the bodi into the great headquart of the brain carri sens messag notifi us of everyth heard seen touch tast or smell as soon as the brain receiv a messag from ani of the five sens it decid what to do about it and if action is decid on send it order back over the nerv wire to the muscl tell them what action to perform your work agent ¶ this latter factthat the muscl are the work agent of the bodyalso explain whi the muscular type is natur more activ than ani of the other sourc of your raw materi ¶ the bodi may be compar to a perfect organ transport system and factori combin the aliment system furnish the raw materi for all the system to work on stationari equip ¶ the bone of the bodi are like the telegraph pole the bridg and structur for the protect and perman of the work carri on by the other system of the bodi now pole bridg and structur are less movabl less alter than ani of the other part of a transport system and likewis the boni element in man make him less alter in everi other way than he would otherwis be a predomin of it in ani individu indic a preponder of this immov tendenc in his natur mind and matter are so insepar bound up togeth in man organ that it is imposs to say just where mind end and matter begin but this we know that even the mind of the boni person partak of the same unbend qualiti that are found in the bone of his bodi everi cell think ¶ thoma a edison as level head and unmyst a scientist as live say everi cell in us think human analysi prove to us that someth veri near this is the case for it show how the habitu mental process of everi individu are alway off the same piec of good as his bodi illustr 9 cerebr the thinker thus the fat man mind act as his bodi actseven unhurri eas and comfort the florid man mind has the same quick and resourc that distinguish all his bodili process the muscular man mind act in the same strenuous way that his bodi act while the boni man brain alway has an immov qualiti close akin to the boni of his bodi he is not necessarili a bonehead but this phrase like fathead is no accid the larg head on the small bodi ¶ as point out befor the larger ani organ or system the more will it tend to express itself so the larg head small bodi man run more to mental than to physic activ and is invari more matur in his think see chart 9 convers the aliment type get it trait from that element stage in human develop when we did littl but get and assimil food and when think was of the simplest form in those day man was more physic than mental he had a larg stomach but a small head so today we see in the pure aliment type peopl who resembl their aliment ancestor they have the same proportion larg stomach and proportion small headwith the stomach system domin their thought action and live the cerebr is the exact opposit of this he has a top heavi head proportion larg for his bodi and a proportion undevelop stomach system his small assimil system ¶ the extrem cerebr differ from other type chiefli in the fact that while his head is unusu larg compar to the bodi his aliment thorac muscular and boni system are smaller and less develop than the averag the latter fact is due to the same law which caus the aliment to have a larg bodi and a small head natur is a wonder effici engin she provid onli as much space as is requir for the function of ani particular organ give extra space onli to those depart that need it the cerebr aliment is the combin which make most of the magnat and the self made millionair such a man has all the aliment desir for the luxuri comfort and good thing of life combin with suffici brain to enabl him to make the money necessari to get them natur doesnt give the pure aliment a larg skull becaus he doesnt need it for the hous of his proportion small brain but concentr on give him a big stomach fit with all modern conveni on the other hand the head of the cerebr is larg becaus his brain is larg the skull which is pliabl and unfinish at birth grow to conform to the size and shape of the brain as the glove take on the shape of the hand insid it stomach vs brain ¶ becaus the aliment and cerebr system are farthest remov from each other evolut a larg brain and a larg stomach are a veri unusu combin such an individu would be a combin of the aliment and cerebr type and would have the aliment fat bodi with a larg highbrow head of the cerebr the possess of these two high develop but opposit kind of system place their owner constant in the predica of decid between the big meal he want and the small one he know he should have for good brain work we are so construct that brain and stomacheach of which demand an extra suppli of blood when perform it workcan not function with maximum effici simultan whi light lunch ¶ when your stomach is busi digest a big meal your brain take a vacat this littl fact is respons for million of light luncheon daili the strenuous manual worker can empti a full dinner pail and profit by it but the brain worker long ago discov that a heavi midday meal gave him a heavi brain for hour afterward clear think and a clear stomach ¶ clear think demand a clear stomach becaus an empti stomach mean that the blood reserv so necessari to vivid think are free to go to the brain without good blood cours at a fair rapid rate through the brain no man can think keen or concentr this explain whi you think of so mani import thing when your stomach is empti that never occur to you when your energi is be monopol by digest heavi dinner and heavi speech ¶ all public speaker have learn that a heavi dinner mean a heavi speech elbert hubbard rule when on his speak tour was one everi orat should follow ten dollar extra if i have to eat said fra elbertusa far cri from the day when we fed up the preacher at sunday dinner with the expect of hear a better sermon use his head ¶ just as assimil is the favorit activ of the aliment type head work is the favorit activ of the larg head cerebr he is so far remov evolut from the stomach stage that his stomach is as much a remnant with him as the brain is a rudiment with the extrem aliment the extra blood suppli which natur furnish to ani over develop part of the bodi also tend to encourag him in think just as the same condit encourag the fat man in eat forget to eat ¶ an aliment never forget dinner time but the cerebr is so much more interest in food for his brain than food for his bodi that he can go without his meal and not mind it he is like to have a book and a cracker at his mealsand then forget to eat the cracker physic sensit ¶ we are mental in proport to the sensit of our mental organ the cerebr possess the most high develop brain center of ani type and is therefor more sensit to all those stimuli which act upon the mind his whole bodi bespeak it the fine of his featur is in direct contrast to some of the other type the unusu size of his brain denot a correspond intric organ of nerv for the nerv are tini elong of the brain the intellectu sensit of ani individu can be accur estim by note the compar size of his brain and bodi his triangular head and face ¶ a triangl is the geometr figur approxim by the cerebr front face and head if he is a pure extrem cerebr a triangl is again what you are remind of when you look at his head from the side for his head stand on a small neck his forehead stand out at the top while his back head is long these bring the widest part of his head nearer the top than we find it in other type delic hand ¶ a thin delic hand denot a larger than averag cerebr element see chart 10 smooth finger ¶ what have long been known as smooth finger are typic of the cerebr these are not to be confus with the fat pudgi babyish finger of the aliment for though the latter finger are smooth around they do not present straight outlin at the side they puff out between the joint smooth finger are characterist of the extrem cerebr type they are call this becaus their outlin run straight up and down the joint of the aliment finger see chart 2 mark the narrowest place owe to the fact that the joint are not changeabl in the osseous finger see chart 8 the opposit is true the joint mark the widest spot and the space between are sunken illustr 10 a typic cerebr face b typic cerebr hand the finger of the thorac are inclin to be point like his head while the muscular finger are squar at the end and look the power they possess ¶ but the cerebr has finger unlik ani of these there is no fat to make them pudgi and no muscl to make them firm neither are there larg joint to make them knotti their outlin therefor run in almost straight line and the whole hand present a more frail aesthet appear medit his keynot ¶ think contempl reflectingal the mental process come under the head of meditationconstitut the keynot of this type the aliment live to eat the thorac to feel the muscular to act the osseous to stabil but the cerebr live to medit air castl ¶ he love to plan imagin dream day dream visual and go over and over in his mind the manifold possibl probabl and potenti of mani thing when he carri this to extremesa the person with a huge head and tini bodi is like to dohe often overlook the question of the practic of the thing he is plan he inclin to go wild cat to dream dream that are imposs of fruition thought for thought sake ¶ he will sit by the hour or by the day think out endless ultim for the sheer pleasur it give him other men blame him criticis him and ridicul him for this and for the most part he doe fail of the practic success by which the effici american measur everyth but the fact must never be forgotten that the world owe it progress to the men who could see beyond their nose who could conceiv of thing no one had ever actual seen this type more than ani other has been the innov in all form of human progress the dreamer ¶ everyth accomplish start with the dream of it is a say we all know to be true yet we go on forev give all the big prize to the doer but the man who can onli dream live in a veri hostil world his real world is his thought but whenev he step out of them into human societi he feel a stranger and he is one doesnt fit ¶ the world of today is rule by peopl who accomplish put it over deliv the good get it across are a part of our languag becaus they repres the standard of the averag american today the cerebr is as much out of place in such an environ as a fish is on dri land he know it and he show it he doesnt know what the other kind are drive at and they know so littl of what he is drive at that they have invent a special name for himth nut do isnt his line he prefer the pleasur of think over to all the put over in the world this type usual is a failur becaus he take it all out in dream without ever do the thing necessari to make his dream come true a visionari ¶ these predilect for overlook the obvious the tangibl and the necessari element in everyday exist tend to make of the cerebr what he is so often calleda visionari for instanc he will build up in his mind the most impos superstructur for an invent and confid tell you it will make million but forget to inform himself on such essenti question as will it work is it transport or is there ani demand for it ahead of his time ¶ he was born ahead of his time appli oftenest to a man of this type he has brain to see what the world need and not infrequ see how the world could get it but he is so avers to action himself that unless activ peopl take up his scheme they seldom materi what we owe to the dreamer ¶ men in whom the cerebr type predomin anticip everi step man has made in his polit social individu industri religi and econom evolut they have seen it decad and sometim centuri in advanc but they were alway ridicul at first the mutter of mors ¶ histori is replet with the stori of unappreci genius in washington d c you will have point out to you a great elm made histor by samuel mors inventor of the telegraph he could not make the success peopl of his day give him a hear but he was so wrap up in his invent that he use to sit under this tree whenev the weather permit and explain all about it to the down and outer and ani one els who would stop listen to the mutter of that poor old fool said the wise one as they hurri by on the other side of the street but today peopl come from everywher to see the famous mors elm and do homag to the great mind that invent the telegraph langley folli ¶ today we fli from contin to contin and air travel is supersed land and water transport whenev great speed is in demand a man receiv word that his child is danger ill he step into an airplan and in less than half the time it would take train or motor to carri him alight at his own door commerc industri war and the futur of whole nation are be revolution by this man made miracl yet it is but a few short year sinc s p langley was sneer at from one end of this countri to the other becaus he stoop to the folli of invent a fli machin the trivial telephon ¶ alexand graham bell invent the telephon but it was mani year befor he could induc anybodi to financ it though some of the wealthiest and therefor suppos wisest busi men of the day were ask to do so none of them would risk a dollar on it even after it had been test at the centenni exposit in philadelphia and found to work perfect it possibl were so littl realiz that for a long while no one could be found to furnish the fund necessari to place it upon the market the wizardri of wireless ¶ then after the world had becom accustom to transact million of dollar worth of busi daili over the onc despis telegraph and telephon it took out it doubt on marconi and his wireless telegraphi it imposs they said talk without wire never but now the radio needl pierc the blue from san diego to shanghai and from your steamer in mid ocean you can say good night to your love one in denver frank bacon play ¶ idea alway have to go beg at first and the greater the idea the rougher the sled the most success play ever put on in america was lightnin written by frank bacon a typic cerebr osseous it ran everi night for three year in new york citi it has made a million peopl happi and a million dollar for it sponsor but when mr bacon who also play the titl role took it to the new york produc they refus it a tri out but becaus he had faith in his dream and persist his name and his play have becom immort an ideal combin ¶ the ideal combin is a dreamer who can do or a doer who know the power of a dream think and actingalmost everi individu is do too much of one and too littl of the other the world two class ¶ the world is divid rough into these two class those who act without think and as a result are often in jail and those who think without act and as a result are often in the poorhous to be a success ¶ to be a success individu today you have got to dream and then do plan and then produc contempl and then construct think it out and then work it out if you do the latter at the expens of the former you are doom to work forev for other peopl to play some other man game if you do the former at the expens of the latter you are doom to know onli the fring of life never to be taken serious and never to achiev pitfal for dreamer ¶ if you are inclin to take your pleasur out in cerebr instead of creat if it suffic you to see a thing in your imagin whether it ever come to pass or not you are at a decid disadvantag in this hustl world and you will never be a success pitfal for the doer ¶ on the other hand if you are content to do what other men dream about and never have dream of your own you will probabl alway have a berth but will never have a million you will exist but you will never know what it is to live the hungri philosoph ¶ the extrem cerebr can sit on a park bench with an empti purs and an empti stomach and get as much pleasur out of reflect on the which of the what and the whither of the wherefor as an aliment get out of a plank steak needless to say each is an enigma to the other yet most peopl imagin that becaus both are human and both walk on their hind leg they are alik they are no more alik than a cow and a canari his frail bodi ¶ the extrem cerebr type find it difficult to do thing becaus as we have seen he is defici in muscleon of the vital element upon which activ and accomplish are base this type has littl muscl littl bone and littl fat defici in hors power ¶ he is not inact for the same reason that the aliment is his stomach process do not slow him down but his muscl are so undevelop that he has littl inward urg toward activ and littl forc back of his movement his heart and lung are small so that he also lack steam and hors power he prefer to sit rather than to move exact as the muscular prefer to be up and do rather than to sit still the man of futil movement ¶ did you ever look on while a pure cerebr man tri to move a kitchen stove ever ask the dreamer in your hous to bring down a trunk from the attic will you ever forget the almost human pervers with which that stove and that trunk resist him or how amus it look to see a grown man outwit at everi turn by an inert mass i have carri on a life long feud with inanim thing a pure cerebr friend remark to us recent i have a fight on my hand everi time i attempt to use a pair of scissor a knife and fork a hammer or a collar button his jerki walk ¶ becaus he is short the cerebr take short step becaus he lack muscl he lack a power stride as a result he has a walk that is irregular and sometim jerki when he walk slowli this jerk is not appar but when hurri it is quit notic is lost in chair ¶ the cerebr get lost in the same chair that is itself lost under the larg spread osseous and for the same reason built for the averag chair are as much too larg for the cerebr as they are too small for the big boni man so the cerebr leg dangl and his arm dont reach dislik social life ¶ though a most sympathet friend the cerebr doe not make mani friend and doe not care for mani he is too abstract to add to the gaieti of social gather for these are base on the enjoy of the concret enjoy the intellectu ¶ reader thinker writersintellectu like himselfar the kind of peopl the cerebr enjoy most anoth reason whi he has few friend is becaus these peopl be in the great minor are not easi to find ignor the ignor ¶ peopl who let other do their think for them and those who are not awar of the great thing go on in world movement are not popular with this type he sometim has a secret contempt for them and ignor them as complet as they ignor him avoid the limelight ¶ modesti and reserv almost as mark in the men as in the women character this extrem type they do thing of great moment sometimesinv someth or write someth extraordinarybut even then they tri to avoid be lioniz they prefer the shadow rather than the spotlight thus they miss mani of the good thing less braini and more aggress peopl gain but it doe no good to explain this to a cerebr he enjoy retir and is constant miss opportun becaus he refus to mix care littl for money ¶ friend mean someth to the cerebr fame sometim mean much but money mean littl in this he is the exact opposit of the osseous to whom the pecuniari advantag or disadvantag of a thing are alway signific the pure cerebr find it difficult to interest himself in his financ he seldom count his chang he will go away from his room leav everi cent he own lie on the dresserand then forget to lock the door this type of person almost never ask for a rais he is too busi dream dream to plan what he will do in his old age he prefer stay at the same job with congeni associ to find anoth even if it paid more veri often poor ¶ sinc we get onli what we go after in this world it follow that the cerebr is often poor to make money one must want money competit for it is so keen that onli those who want it bad and work with effici ever get veri much of it the cerebr take so littl interest in money that he get lost in the shuffl not until he wake up some morn with the poorhous stare him in the face doe he give it serious consider and then he doe not do much about it almost never rich ¶ histori show that few peopl of the pure cerebr type ever becam rich even the most brilliant gave so much more thought to their mission than the practic way and mean that they were usual serious handicap for the fund necessari to it materi madam curi co discover of radium said to be the greatest live woman of this type is world famous and has done human a nobl servic but her experi were alway carri on against great disadvantag becaus she had not the financi mean to purchas more than the most limit quantiti of the precious substanc about cloth ¶ cloth are almost the last thing the cerebr think about as we have seen all the other type have decid prefer as to their clothesth aliment demand comfort the thorac style the muscular durabl and the osseous samenessbut the extrem cerebr type say anyth will do so we often see him with a coat of one color trouser of anoth and a hat of anoth with no glove at all and his tie miss often absent mind ¶ we have alway said peopl were absent mind when their mind were absent from what they were do this often appli to the cerebr for he is capabl of greater concentr than other type also he is so frequent compel to do thing in which he has no interest that his mind natur wander to the thing he care about a cerebr professor whom we know sometim appear befor his harvard class in bedroom slipper a thorac would not be like to let his own brother catch him in his write better than he talk ¶ the poor talker sometim surpris us by be a good writer such a one is usual of the cerebr type he like to think out everi phase of a thing and put it into just the right word befor give it to the world so mani a cerebr who doe littl talk outsid his intim circl doe a good deal of surreptiti write it may be onli the keep of a diari jot down memoranda or write long letter to his friend but he will write someth some of the world greatest idea have come to light first in the forgotten manuscript of peopl of this type who die without show their write to ani one evid they did not consid them of suffici import or did not care as much about publish them as about put them down an inveter reader ¶ step into the refer room of your citi librari on a summer day and you will stand more chanc of find exampl of this extrem type there than in ani other spot you may have thought these extrem type are difficult to locat sinc the averag american is a combin but it is easi to find ani of them if you look in the right place in everi case you will find them in the veri place where a studi of human analysi would tell you to look for them where to look for pure type ¶ when you wish to find some pure aliment go to a restaur that is famous for it rich food when you want to see sever extrem thorac drop into ani vaudevill show and take your choic from the actor or from the audienc when you are look for pure muscular go to a box match or a prize fight and you will be surround by them when look for the osseous attend a convent of expert account banker lumbermen hardwar merchant or pioneer all these type appear in other place and in other vocat but they are certain to be present in larg number ani day in ani of the abov name place but when you are look for this interest littl extrem thinker type you must go to a librari we specifi the refer room of the librari becaus those who search for fiction newspap and magazin are not necessarili of the pure type and we specifi a day in summer rather than in winter so that you will be abl to select your subject from amongst peopl who are there in spite of the weather rather than becaus of it interest in everyth ¶ i never saw a book without want to read it said a cerebr friend to us the other day this express the interest everi person of this type has in the print page i never see a librari without wish i had time to go there and stay till i had read everyth in it the book worm ¶ so it is small wonder that such a one becom known earli in life as a book worm as a littl child he take readili to read and wont take to much els becaus we all learn quick what we like he is soon devour book for older head whi wont he run and play like other children wail mother and that boy ought to be made to join the ball team scold father but that boy continu to keep his nose in a book he can talk on almost ani subjectwhen he willand know pretti well what is go on in the world at an age when other boy are oblivi to everyth but gymnasium and girl old for his year ¶ the littl old man or littl old woman of ten is alway a cerebr child the aliment are the babi of the race and never entir grow up no matter how mani year they live but the cerebr is born old from infanc he show more matur than other children the teacher pet ¶ his studious and tractabl lead to one reward in childhood though it often cost him dear as a man he usual becom the teacher favorit and no wonder he alway has his lesson he give her littl troubl and is about all that keep mani a teacher at her poor paid post littl sens of time ¶ the extrem cerebr often has a defici sens of time he is less conscious of the passag of the hour than ani other type the muscular and the osseous often have an almost uncanni time sens but the extrem cerebr man often lack it forget to wind his watch or to consult it for hour when he doe is a familiar habit of this type we know a bride in detroit whose flat look out on a bakeri and a bookstor she told us that she use to send her cerebr hubbi across the street for the loaf of bread that was found lack just as they were readi to sit down to dinneron to wait hour and then have him come back with a book under his arm no bread and no realize of how long he had been gone inclin to be unorthodox ¶ other type tend to follow various religionsaccord to the individu upbringingbut the cerebr compos a larg percentag of the unorthodox the polit reform ¶ becaus all form of person combat are distast to him the pure cerebr doe not go out and fight for reform as often as the muscular nor die for caus as often as the osseous type but almost everi cerebr believ in extrem reform of one kind or anoth he is a compar silent but faith member of club leagu and other kind of reform organ he may never star in them he seldom care to but his mite is alway readi when subscript are taken even if he has to go without breakfast for a week to make up for it this type is usual suffici intellig to know the world need reform and suffici conscienti to want to help to do it he is not bound by tradit or custom as much as other type but doe more of his own think without the foresight and faith of the cerebr veri few reform could have start or have live to finish the social nonconformist ¶ ask ani small bodi larg head man if he believ in the doubl standard of moral anti suffrag etern punish saloon or the four hundr this littl man with the big head may not open challeng you or argu with you when you stand up for thing as they are for he is a peaceabl chapbut he inward smile or sneer at what he consid your troglodyt idea he see a day come when babi will be name for their father whether the minist offici or not when the man who now talk about the good old day of a wide open saloon on everi corner will himself be a hazi myth and when societi idler will not be consid better than peopl who earn their live the world pathfind ¶ the cerebr therefor lead the world in idea the world is manag by fat men entertain by florid men built by muscular men oppos by boni men but is improv in the final analysi by it think men these thinker have a difficult time of it they preach to deaf ear and often they die in poverti but at last poster come around to their way of think abandon the old rut and follow the trail they have blaze therefor mani great thinker who were unknown while aliv becam famous after death more often than not fame is the food of the tomb indiffer to surround ¶ a wise man it was who said let me see a man surround and i will tell you what he is the cerebr doe not realli live in his hous but in his head and for that reason doe not feel as great an urg to decor amplifi or even furnish the place in which he dwell step into the room of ani littl bodi larg head man and you will be struck by two factsthat he has fewer jimcrack and more journal lie around than the rest of your friend in the room of the aliment you will find cushion sofa and eat in that of the thorac you will find color unusu thing the muscular will have durabl solid plain thing the osseous will have fewer of everyth but what he doe have will be in order but the pure cerebr furnishingsif he is respons for themwil be an indiffer array with no two piec match furthermor everyth will be pile with newspap magazin book and clip often die young ¶ the good die young is an old say which may or may not be true but there is no doubt that the extrem cerebr type of individu often die at an earli age the reason is clear an effici but control assimil system is the first requisit for long life and the pure cerebr doe not have an effici one moreov he is prone to neglect what nutrit mechan he doe have by irregular eat by be too poor to afford wholesom food and by forget to eat at all physic asset ¶ by reason of his defici physic the cerebr can not be said to possess ani decid physic asset but two tendenc which help decid to prolong life are under eat and his refus to dissip it has been said mani time by the best known expert that more death are caus annual in america by over eat than by ani other two caus under eat is a veri necessari precaut but the cerebr carri it too far the cerebr lack a larg alimentari system is not tempt to overload his stomach or overtax his vital organ and becaus he is a high evolv type possess littl of the instinct which are at the bottom of most dissip he is not addict to late hour wine women or excit diseas he is most suscept to ¶ nervous diseas of all kind most frequent afflict this type his nervous system is supersensit it break down more easili and more complet than that of the more element type just as a high power car is more easili wreck than a truck music he like ¶ highbrow music is kept aliv most by highbrow while the other type cultiv a tast for grand opera or simul it becaus it is suppos proper the cerebr realli enjoy it in the top galleri at ani good concert you will find mani cerebr entertain he prefer ¶ the serious drama and educ lectur are other favorit entertain of the cerebr he care littl for vaudevill girl show or clap trap farc the kind of program that keep the fat man smile spread from ear to ear take the cerebr to the box offic for his money a steadi patron at the movi ¶ the cerebr goe to the movi more than ani other type save the fat man but not for the same reason the larg brain small bodi man care noth for most of the recreat with which the other type amus themselv so the theater is almost his onli divers it is oftentim the onli kind of entertain within the reach of his purs and it deal with mani differ subject in almost all of which the pure cerebr has some interest dont laugh at same thing ¶ but if you will notic next time you go to a movi it will be clear to you that the fat peopl and the larg head peopl do not laugh at the same thing the pie throw and cutey coquett that convuls the two hundr pounder fail to so much as turn up the corner of the other man mouth and the subtl thing that amus the cerebr go over the head of the pure aliment care for no sport ¶ but the fat man and the larg brain man have one trait in common neither of them care for strenuous sport the fat man dislik them becaus he is too heavi on his feet the cerebr dislik them becaus he is too heavi at the opposit extrem he expend what littl energi he has in mental activ so has none left for violent physic exert like mental game ¶ this type enjoy quiet game requir thought chess and checker are favorit with them the imperson ¶ the cerebr is the most imperson of all type while the aliment tend to measur everyth from the standpoint of what it can do for him person the cerebr tend to think more imperson and to be interest in mani thing outsid of his own affair lack pugnac ¶ primit thing of everi kind are distast to the cerebr the instinct of digest sex hunt and pugnac are but littl develop in him he is therefor a man who like harmoni avoid come to blow and goe out of his way to keep the peac such a man doe not go hunt and seldom own a gun he dislik to kill or harm ani creatur the cleverest crook ¶ the cerebr is usual a natur moral person but when lack in conscienc either through bad train or other caus he occasion turn to crime for his incom this is becaus his physic frailti make it difficult for him to do heavi work while his mental enabl him to think out way and mean of get a live without it though the clumsi crimin may belong to ani type the cleverest crooksthos who defi detect for yearsalway have a larg element of the cerebr in their makeup big brain in littl job ¶ there are two kind of work in the worldhead work and hand work mental and manual if you can star in either life guarante you a good live but if you are good at neither you are doom to depend the cerebr physic frailti unfit him for the manual and unless he is school or self educ he becom the sorriest of all human misfit he fall between the two and lead a precari exist work in the lighter indoor posit requir the least mental if you will keep your eye open you will mani time note that the littl waiter in the high class restaur or hotel has a head veri larg for his bodi such men are much better read have a far greater appreci of art and literatur and more natur refin than the porki patron they serv social asset ¶ a fine sens of the right of other and natur modesti and refin are the chief social asset of this type social liabil ¶ lack of self express too great reserv and too much abstract in convers are the thing that handicap the cerebr his small statur and timid air also add to his appear of insignific and caus him to be overlook at social affair emot asset ¶ sympathi gentl and self sacrific are other asset of this type emot liabil ¶ a tendenc to nervous excit and to a lack of balanc are the chief emot handicap of this type busi asset ¶ this type has no trait which can proper be call busi asset he dislik busi is repel by it standard and has no place in ani of it pure commerci branch busi liabil ¶ his inabl to keep his feet on the ground and his tendenc to live in the cloud and to be general impract unfit this type for busi life domest strength ¶ tender consider and ideal are the chief domest asset of the cerebr type domest weak ¶ inabl to provid for his famili incapac for make the money necessari to meet their need and his tendenc to spend the littl he doe have on imposs scheme are what wreck the domest life of mani splendid cerebr men her inabl to make one dollar do the work of two is a serious handicap to the cerebr wife or mother should aim at ¶ this man should aim at build up his bodi and practic his mental process should avoid ¶ the cerebr should avoid shallow ignor peopl specul and those situat that carri him farther away from the real world his strong point ¶ his think capac progress unselfish and high civil instinct are the strongest point of this type his weakest point ¶ impract dreami physic frailti and his tendenc to plan without do are the trait which stand in the way of his success how to deal with this type social ¶ dont expect him to be a social lion dont expect him to mingl with mani invit him when there are to be a few congeni soul and if he wander into the librari leav him alon how to deal with this type in busi ¶ dont employ this man for heavi manual labor or where there is more arm work than head work give him mental posit or none if you are deal with him as a tradesman resist the temptat to take advantag of his impract and dont treat him as if you thought money was everyth rememb the chief distinguish mark of the cerebr in the order of their import are the high forehead and a proportion larg head for the bodi ani person who has these is larg of the cerebr type no matter what other type may be includ in his makeup to understand combin determin which type predomin in a subject if there is ani doubt in your mind about this do these four thing 1st note the bodi buildwhich one of the five bodi type as shown in chart 1 3 5 7 9 doe he most resembl in do this it will aid you if you will note whether fat bone or muscl predomin in his bodili structur 2nd decid which of the five typic face his face most resembl 3rd decid which of the five typic hand his hand most resembl 4th if still undecid note his voic gestur and movement and they will leav no doubt in your mind as to which of these type come first and which second have decid which type predomin and which is second in him the signific of this combin is made clear to you by the follow law law of combin ¶ the type predomin in a person determin what he doe throughout his lifeth natur of his main activ the type which come second in develop will determin the way he doe thingsth method he will follow in do what his predomin type signifi the third element if notic mere flavor his person thus a cerebr muscular aliment doe mental thing predomin throughout his life but in a more muscular way than if he were an extrem cerebr the aliment element be third down the list will tend to make him eat and assimil more food than he otherwis would chapter vi type that should and should not marri each other i am so sorri to hear the brown are be divorc i have known georg and mari for year and they are as fine a man and woman as i ever saw but they just dont seem abl to get along togeth how mani time you have heard someth like this and the speaker got nearer the truth than he knew for the georg and mari everywher are on the whole fine men and women marri to the wrong one ¶ each one is all right in himself but mere marri to the wrong persona fact we have recogn when both georg and mari made success of their second ventur and live happili ever after human happi as we have note in the introduct to this volum is attain onli through do what the organ was built to do in an environ that is favor marriag is onli the attempt of two peopl to attain these two end individu mutual and simultan difficulti of doubl har ¶ now sinc it is almost imposs for one to achiev happi when untrammel and free is it to be wonder at that so few achiev it in doubl har for the difficulti to be surmount are doubl and the help are halv by the presenc of a run mate mere married is not mate ¶ that two can live on less than one is not truebut it is nearer the truth than that two can find ultim happi togeth easier than either can find an approxim of happi alon this is not say that ani one who is unmat can have happi as complet as that which come to the right matedfor noth els in life can compar with thatbut they must be right mate not mere marri no one who has observ or thought on this subject will deni that it is a thousand time better not to be marri at all than to be marri to the wrong person secret told by statist ¶ survey of the caus for divorc dure the past ten year in the unit state have reveal some startl factsfact which onli prove again that human analysi show us the truth about ourselv as no scienc has ever shown it to us befor one of the most illumin fact these survey have reveal is that onli those men and women can be happi togeth whose natur automat encourag each other in the do of the thing each like to do in the way each like to do them inborn inclin determin the thing everi human be prefer to do concern all the fundament activ of his life and also the manner in which he prefer to do them these inborn inclin as we have previous point out are written all over us in the unmistak languag of type when we know a man type we know what thing he prefer to do in life main experi and how he prefer to do them and we know that unless he is permit to do approxim what he want to do in approxim the way he prefer he becom unhappi and unsuccess infatu no guid ¶ these biolog bent are so deepli embed in everi individu that no amount of affect admir or respect or passion for ani other individu suffic to enabl ani one to go through long year do what he dislik and still be happi onli in the first flush of infatu can he sacrific his own prefer for those of anoth after a while passion and infatu ooz away natur see to that just as she see to their come in the first place then there return the old lean prefer tendenc and crave inher in the type of each the real revers to type ¶ under this urg of his type each revert gradual but irresist to his old habit do larg what he prefer to do in the way that are to his like when that day come the real test of their marriag begin if the distanc between them is too great they can not cross that chasm and thereaft each live a life inward remov from the other they make attempt to cross the barrier and some of these are success for a short while they talk to and fro across the void sometim but their commune becom less frequent their voic less distinct until at last each withdraw into himself there he live in the world of his own naturea complet separ from his mate as though they dwelt on differ planet we can know ¶ but how is one to know the right person you ask by recogn scienc recent discoveri to the effect that certain type can travel help happili and harmoni togeth and that certain other never can what everi individu owe to himself ¶ everi individu owe it to himself to find the right work and the right mate becaus these are fundament need of everi human be lack them life is a failur possess but one of them life is half a failur to obtain and appli the veri fullest knowledg toward the attain of these two great requisit should be the aim of everi person neglect subject ¶ despit the fact that these are the most vital problem pertain to human happi and that everi individu life depend for it glori or defeat joy or sorrow upon the right settlement of themthey are two of the most neglect divorc court ¶ our divorc court are full of splendid men and women who are there not becaus they are weak or wrong but becaus they step into natur age old instinct trap without realiz where it would lead them these men and women who pay so heavi a price for their ignor and blind are not to blame most of them have been taught that to be legal bound togeth was suffici guarante of marit bliss but experi has shown us that there are certain kind of peopl each individu can associ with in harmoni and that there are those with whom he could never be happi though a hundr minist pronounc them mate for life time will chang ¶ but the time is come when we will select our mate scientif not mere sentiment it is also come when we will know what everi child is fit to do by look at him just as we know better today than to set a shepherd dog on the trail of crimin or a bloodhound to herd sheep the great quest ¶ instead of becloud the signific and the saniti of life great quest instead of encourag everi manner of mismat as we do today we will some day arm our children with knowledg enabl them to wise choos their life work and their life mate dolli dimpl ¶ the fact that dolli has a dimpl may make your sens whirl but it is not suffici basi for marriag there are thing of vast greater import though of cours this doe not seem possibl to you at the time sammi smile ¶ and though sammi sport a smile the god might envi he may not be the right man for dolli even a smile that never come off great lubric that it undeni is is not suffici foundat for a till death do us part contract littl thing vs big thing ¶ when we hear of a divorc we assum that it was caus by the inabl of those two peopl to agre upon fundament we suppos that they found within themselv wide diverg of opinion feel or attitud regard realli worth while questionssoci religi polit or econom we are inclin to imagin that the littl thing should take care of themselv and that onli the big thing such as these should be allow to separ two live onc they have been join togeth what the record show ¶ yet the exact opposit is what happen accord to the divorc record of the unit state these record show that divorc do not aris out of differ in what we have alway call the big thing of life but out of those thing which we have alway call the littl one whi he cant chang ¶ we do not expect a husband or wife to chang his religion and take on his partner faith we imagin this is an inher thing more or less deepli imbed in him and not to be alter while we consid it onli fair and right for john to give up his favorit sport his hobbi and some of his habit for mari sake at the risk of shock the supersensit it must be admit that most individu get their religi lean from extern sourcespar teacher minist friend and especi by the accid of be born in a certain countri among a certain sect or within a certain communiti on the other hand one prefer in the matter of divers are born in him part and parcel of his veri be and remain so to the end of his life accord just as it is easier to chang the frost on a cake than to chang the insid it is easier to chang a man religion than to chang his activ divers and divorc ¶ most of the divorc grant in america dure the past ten year have been demand not on ground deal with the so call fundament but for differ regard so call unimport thing and more than seventi out of everi hundr divorc everi year in this countri are ask for on ground pertain to divers in other word more than seventi per cent of american divorc are grant becaus husband and wive can not adapt themselv to each other in the matter of how they shall spend their leisur hour peopl who can not play togeth will not work togeth long said elbert hubbard human analysi which show that each type tend automat to the do of certain thing in certain way whenev free to act prove that this is just as liter as it sound the onli time we are free to act is dure our leisur hour all other hour are mortgag to earn a livingin the accomplish of which we often have veri littl outlet for natur trend so it is onli after hour and over sunday that the mass of mankind have an opportun to express their real natur uncongeni work affect marriag ¶ the less one work permit him to do the thing he enjoy the more sure will he turn to them in the hour when this restraint is remov if such a one has a husband or wife who encourag him in the follow of his natur bent dure leisur hour that marriag stand a big chanc of be happi these two peopl may differ wide in their respect religi ideason may be a cathol the other a protest or one a shaker and the other a christian scientistbut they can build last happi togeth on the other hand two peopl who agre perfect as to religi social and polit view but who can not agre as to the disposit of their leisur hour are bound for the rock as the honeymoon fade each revert to the kind of recreat congeni to his type if his mate is avers to his divers each goe his own way the etern triangl ¶ the tragedi of the other man and the other woman is not a mysteri to him who understand human analysi it is alway the result of find some one of kindr standard and tastesthat is some one whose type is congeni the etern triangl aris again and again in human live not accident but as the inevit result of violat inexor law law of marit happi ¶ marriag should take place onli between those whose first type element are suffici similar for them to enjoy the same general divers yet whose second type element are suffici dissimilar to make each strong where the other is weak ¶ the applic of the law to each of the five type will be explain in the follow section of this chapter part one the aliment in love ¶ just as each type react differ to all the other situat in life each react differ to love the aliment as we have point out is less matur than the other type with the thorac next and so on down to the cerebr which is the most matur of all becaus the aliment has right been call the babi of the race becaus no extrem fat person ever realli grow up this type prefer those love express natur to the immatur the most affection type ¶ caress pet fondl and cuddlingthos demonstr not of wild passion but of affect such as children enjoyar most often use by aliment men and women when in love ¶ becaus they are inclin to bestow littl attent more or less promiscu they often get the reput of be flirtati when they are not such action also are often taken by the one to whom they are direct as indic more than the giver mean so bewar of take the littl pat of fat peopl too serious they mean well but have the babi habit of bestow innoc smile and caress everywher whi they are love ¶ each type has trait peculiar to itself which tend to make other fall in love with it in the aliment the outstand trait which win love is his sweet disposit the human ego is so constitut that we tend to like all interest peopl who do not offer us opposit the aliment is amen affabl agreeabl his readi smile his tendenc to promot harmoni and his general genial bring him love and keep it for him while more clever type lose it millionair marri them ¶ whi doe a brilliant busi man marri that littl fat woman who is not his equal mental the world has ask mani a time human analysi answer it as it answer so mani of the other age long queri about human eccentr ¶ the littl fat woman has a sweet dispositionon of the most sooth of human attribut the busi man has enough of brilliant peopl all day when he get home he is rather inclin to be mere the tire busi man and in that state noth is more agreeabl than a wife with a smile ¶ as for fat husband mani a wife support them in prefer to be support by anoth and less agreeabl man the prettiest type ¶ when a woman becom engag her friend all inquir what doe he do but when a man engag is announc everi one ask what doe she look like so it is small wonder that men have place pretti near the top of the list and the aliment woman is the prettiest of all type this littl fact must not be overlook when search for the caus which have prompt so mani of the world wealthiest men to marri them other men may have to content themselv with plain wive but the man of mean can pick and chooseand everi man prefer a pretti wife to a plain one feminin pretti not beauti consist of the rose bud mouth the babi eye the cute littl nose the round cheek the dimpl chin etcal more or less monopol by the aliment type the woman type ¶ the fat woman refus to worri keep the wrinkl away and as long as she doe not becom obes she remain attract her cling vine way make men call her the most woman type and even when she tip the scale at two hundr and fifti they are still for her then they say she look so mother so the fat woman goe through life more love by men than ani other type and in old age she present a pictur of calm and domest seren that is appeal to everybodi marri earliest and oftenest ¶ be in demand the aliment woman marri earlier than ani other type as a widow the same demand take her off the marriag market while younger and brainier women pine their live away in spinsterhood look back and you will recal that it was the pretti plump girl who had beaux earliest marri earliest and who even when left with sever children did not remain widow long desir trait of aliment wive ¶ next to her sweet disposit the trait which make the aliment wife most pleasant to get along with are seren optim and good cook her weak ¶ mani an aliment wife lose her husband love becaus of her too easi go habit unless control these lead to slovenli in person appear and housekeep the aliment wife and money ¶ the aliment wife usual has her share of the famili incom becaus she has the endear way that wring it out of hubbi sale peopl everywher say we like to see a fat woman come for she usual has money spend it freeli and is easi to pleas in disagr ¶ what they do with their quarrel after they are through with them determin to a great extent the ultim success of ani pair marriag aliment husband and wive buri the hatchet sooner than other type and they avoid alterc live anywher ¶ the aliment wife offer less resist to her husband plan than ani other so when he announc they are move to some other neighborhood citi or state she acquiesc with better grace than other type famili friend ¶ the respons of ad new friend to the famili rest equal upon each partner in marriag the averag husband by reason of mingl more with the world has the greater opportun but everi wife can and should consid that she owe it to herself her husband and her children to contribut her quota aliment husband and wive add their share of new acquaint to ani marriag in which they are partner the aliment wife alway enjoy have peopl in to dinner and the aliment husband enjoy bring them the warmth of hospit in aliment home bring them more friendship than come to other type fat man also marri young ¶ the fat man marri young but for a differ reason than the fat woman the fat man as you will note get a job earli in life from that time on his servic seldom go beg he make a good salari earlier than other type and is therefor sooner in a posit to marri the ladi man ¶ just as the fat woman is a man woman so the fat man is almost invari a ladi man the fat man usual know women better than ani other type and it is certain that the fat woman know men her record prove it no fat bachelor ¶ just as there are few fat old maid there are few fat bachelor you can count on the finger of one hand all the realli overweight one you ever knew the best provid ¶ becaus he make money easili through the various form of his superior busi qualif the averag fat man has plenti of money for his famili and like to spend it upon them he is the best provid of all the type fat peopl are the most lenient parent and usual over indulg their children the husband who make a habit for year of send home crate of the first strawberri melon and orang of the season is a fat one everi time desir trait of fat husband ¶ his generous provis for his famili and the fact that he is essenti a famili man are two desir trait of the aliment husband he depend more on his home than other type he marri young to have a home and he is seldom farther away from it than he has to be it is unfortun that the one type which make the best travel man is more inconvenienc by the absenc from home than ani other type would be but he has not submit silent all the world know what a hard life the travel salesman lead and how he miss the wife the kid and the good home cook weak of aliment husband ¶ the aliment husband has but one weak that materi endang his marit happi he is inclin to be too easi and extravag and not to save money mate for aliment ¶ becaus of his amen the aliment can marri almost ani type and be happi but for fullest happi those who are predomin alimentivethat is those in whom the aliment type come firstshould marri as a first choic those who are predomin muscular the muscular share the aliment ambit to get on in the world and at the same time add to the union the practic which offset the too easi go lackadais tendenc of the aliment the second choic for the predomin aliment should be the one who is predomin thorac these two type have much in common the brillianc and speed of the thorac keep the aliment look to his laurel and thus tend to prevent the careless which is so great a handicap to the predomin aliment the third choic of the predomin aliment may be one who is also predomin aliment but in that case it should be an aliment muscular or an aliment cerebr the last type the pure aliment should ever marri is the pure cerebr part two love and the thorac ¶ the thorac in love exhibit the same general trait which character him in all his other relationship the most beauti woman ¶ the thorac woman is the most beauti type of all she is not pretti like the aliment but her refin featur and beauti color give her a distinct appear the handsomest man ¶ the thorac is also the handsomest man of all he is tall high chest wide shoulder and has the masculin face result from his high bridg promin nose and high cheek bone the thorac charmer ¶ the thorac has more of that qualiti we call charm than ani other type charm is larg self express by tact method sinc this type is the most self express and the most tact it possess natur this invalu trait both men and women of this type have an elus attract someth in their person that other do not havea veri person appeal that make an immedi impress it pierc farther beneath the surfac of stranger than other type do on much longer acquaint the thorac doe not seem a stranger at all his own confid given to you almost immedi upon meet you remov the barrier the lure of the thorac ¶ there is about the thorac person a lure that other seldom have you do not attempt to describ it you say he is just differ and he is no other type has his spontan and instantan respons so while the aliment is alway like it is in a more mild easi comfort way the aliment doe not stir the blood but has a strong tender even hold on peopl the thorac on the other hand intrigu your attent impal it and hold it love at first sight ¶ the thorac fall in love at first sight much more often than other type they also caus other to fall in love with them without preliminari for they pursu the object of their affect with a fire and furi that is almost irresist ¶ hundr of person marri each year who have known each other but a few day or week in everi instanc you will find that one of them is a thoracicand usual both no other type can becom so hopeless in love on such short notic the most flirtati ¶ the thorac is a born philander he doe not mean to mislead or injur but flirtat is second natur to him this come from the fact that flirtat more than ani other human experi contain that adventur thrill element he desir overheard in transit ¶ we overheard the follow convers in the street car the other day between two young women who occupi the seat in front of us i was sorri to hurt him explain the thorac i did love him last week and i told him so but i dont love him ani more and i do love somebodi els now she realli love himlast week thorac can have a sever case of love and get just as complet over it in a week as the rest of us get over the measl the joy of life ¶ a joy in live express itself in almost everyth the thorac doe especi when he is young such peopl appear almost electr these are trait of great fascin and the thorac use them freeli upon other throughout his life alway blush ¶ his over develop circulatori system caus the thorac to blush easili and often this tendenc has long been capit by women but is not so much enjoy by men most easili hurt ¶ becaus of his supersensit the thorac feel are more easili hurt than those of other type as everi one who has ever had a florid friend or sweetheart will rememb they forgiv quick and complet but everi littl thing said look or act by the love one is translat in term of the person boni peopl especi find it difficult to understand or be toler of this trait in the thorac becaus it is the exact opposit of themselv they call the thorac thin skin and the thorac repli that the boni man has a skin like a walrus and each is right from his own viewpoint the chivalr thorac man ¶ with his keen intuit his sens of the fit of thing and his trigger like adept the thorac man easili becom an attent and chivalr companion where the boni man is often oblivi to the fine point of courtesi the thorac anticip his friend everi wish and movement pick up her handkerchief almost befor she has drop it open door instantan and special in those grace dear to the heart of woman he is like to do as much for the veri next ladi he meet just as soon as he meet her these readi courtesi cost the thorac husband as mani explan as the caress habit cost the aliment breach of promis ¶ more bona fide breach of promis suit are brought against the thorac man than ani other he think rapid speak almost as quick as he think and about what he think consequ mani an honor man has awaken some morn to find he has to pay the piper for an impuls propos made to a girl he would not walk across the street now to see mani a girl too when she is in love with love promis to marri and the next day wonder what made her do it this is the type of chameleon like girl whose vagari and sweet uncertainti form the theme of mani short stori in most of which she is pictur as the etern feminin she get much attent ¶ nevertheless mani a man prefer this creatur of a million mood to the staid and sedat girl of other type so the thorac girl seldom lack for attent she doe not have as mani intim friend as the fat girl for she is less comfort and comfort is one of the first requisit of friendship but she has a longer line of beaux danc attend upon her send her flower candi and messag the stun girl ¶ anoth reason whi the thorac girl has more attent from men is that she is the most smart gown of all the type the new the extrem the veri latest in women cloth are first seen on the thorac girl she is the type men call stun men prefer companion who appear wellwhom other men admir the thorac woman demand the same of the men she goe about with and for these two reason mani thorac marri those in whom their own type predomin the merri widow ¶ make a note of the dash widow you have knownthos who were call the merri widowsand you will recal a larg thorac element in each for this type of woman unlik the home keep aliment enjoy be a widow and remain one she usual has mani chanc to remarri but her changeabl gaieti love natur revel in the freedom sophist and distinct of widowhood the appear of endless youth given by her aliv respons person deceiv the most discern as to her age the woman of fifti who enthral the youth of twenti five is usual of the thorac type refus to grow old ¶ this woman refus to grow old just as the aliment refus to grow up she cling to her beauti as doe no other type she it is who self sacrif starv herself to retain her slender who massag and exercis and cold cream herself hour a day befor the shrine of etern youth her high color all her own is a decid asset in this direct this woman devot as much attent to her groom at sixti as the aliment doe at twenti for this reason you may ani day see two women of forti togeth one an aliment and the other a thoracicand take the plump one to be sever or mani year older than the florid one love the bright light ¶ thorac men and women care more about the bright light than other type the aliment like what he call a good timewith fun and plenti of refreshmentsbut the thorac idea of a good time usual includ a touch of high life this all come from his love of thrill and novelti and is innoc enough but it lead to misunderstand and broken home unless the thorac marri the right type of person ¶ the osseous for instanc has noth in his conscious by which to understand the desir for excit which is so strong in the thorac we have all known good wive and love mother whose marit happi was destroy becaus they could not compel themselv to lead the drab exist laid out for them by their boni stoni husband in mani case the wife who onli want a littl innoc fun was less to blame than her unbend spous whi she went insan ¶ one day sever year ago we drove up to a lone farmhous in montana just as a tragedi was enact the mother was be taken to the state asylum for the insan the seven littl children watch the strang perform unabl to understand what had happen the father a tall raw bone angular man was almost as mystifi as the children crazi he said i dont believ it say what did she have to go crazi about she hasnt seen anyth to excit her whi shes not been off this farm for twenti year the gay devil husband ¶ the same thing happen everi day between sever boni wive and their florid frolick husband she is a perfect housekeep and a good wife exclaim her friendswhi should her husband spend his even away from home these question will continu to be ask until we realiz that be a good housekeep and a good wife doe not fill the bill with a thorac man a wife who will leav the dinner dish in the kitchen sink occasion and run away with him for a lark on a moment notic is the kind that retain the love of her florid husband a husband who is will to leav his favorit magazin pipe and slipper to take her out in the even is the kind a thorac woman like she even prefer a gay devil to a sticka she call the slow one make him jealous ¶ the thorac man want his wife to look well and be pleas but no husband want his wife to be irresist attract to other men so it often happen that the thorac woman caus her husband much jealousi her youth action and distinct dress make her a magnet for all eye if he happen to be too differ in type to understand her natur and pure minded in this he often suffer keen sometim he caus her to suffer for it when they get home human analysi make us all more toler of each other it enabl us to know whi peopl act as they do and best of all that they mean well and not ill most of the time dislik the monoton ¶ the thorac you will rememb dislik monotoni everyth savor of routin samenessth dead levelwear on him three meal a day three hundr and sixti five day in a year with the same person in the same room at the same tabl is unspeak irksom to him he may love that other person with complet and constanc but he occasion demand what bernard shaw call domest chang of air my wife gone to the countri was the biggest song hit of it year becaus there were so mani florid men who understood just how that man felt ¶ the florid wife is as love as ani other but she heav a sigh of relief and invit her women friend in for a parti when john goe away on busi not easi to live with ¶ thorac husband or wive are not as easi to live with as the aliment they are too affect too suscept to sudden chang of mood they live altern on the crest of the wave and in the depth and rob the home of that seren which is essenti to harmoni impuls tendenc which made the sweetheart ador are less attract in the wife and hubbi hair trigger tempera she now call just plain temper desir trait of thorac ¶ that they are the most charm in manner the most tast in dress and the most entertain of ani type constitut the trait which make the thorac husband or wife desir and attract live beyond mean ¶ husband and wive of this type present this marit problem howev they tend to live beyond their mean the husband in such a case seldom confid the true state of his financi affair to his wife while the thorac wife bent on make the best possibl appear find it almost imposs to trim down expenditur to fit the famili purs the habit of entertain extravag and almost constant also cost the thorac household dear ¶ the desir on the part of a thorac husband or wife to move frequent from that particular hous neighborhood or citi present anoth difficulti should marri own type ¶ for the reason state abov and throughout this work the predomin thorac person should marri his own type as first choic no other can understand his impuls his second choic should be a person predomin of the aliment type the aliment is more like the thorac than ani other and in the place where they differ the aliment give in with better grace than other type the third choic may be a predomin muscular person in the latter case howev the muscular should have either thorac or aliment tendenc combin with his muscular becaus they are so differ as to be almost opposit and therefor unabl to understand each other the last person the thorac should marri is the osseous part three marriag and muscular ¶ the muscular doe not marri earli like the aliment nor hastili like the thorac his is a practic natur and his practic is express here as in everyth els back of his marriag you will often find some of the same practic reason that prompt his other activ marri between twenti five and thirti five ¶ most muscular are still unmarri at twenti five when their aliment friend have famili and when their thorac one have had a divorc or two but few muscular are unmarri at thirti five though at that age their osseous and cerebr friend are often still singl the muscular doe not marri on noth and as he doe not star in ani line of work as earli in life as the aliment or thorac he doe not have the mean to marri as earli in life as they but he is a splendid worker get someth to do and doe it fair well the aliment spend too much on food and other comfort and the thorac too much on luxuri but the muscular while not mercenari save a larger portion of his incom make sensibl marriag ¶ so at somewher around thirti the muscular is prepar to establish a home by that time he has live past the rash stage and select a mate as much like himself as possibl in order not to be thwart in his aim for get somewher in the worldaim which domin this type all his life a mate for wear qualiti ¶ this type select his mate as he select his clothesfor wear qualiti he prefer plain simpl peopl for he is plain and simpl himself they are not carri off their feet by impuls as are some of the other type they therefor choos wive and husband whose lovabl qualiti show sign of durabl the most posit lover ¶ the muscular make love almost as strenuous as he doe everyth els he doe not do it especi grace like the thorac nor caress like the aliment but intens and in dead earnest he doe not cut short the courtship like the thorac nor extend it for year like the osseous but marri as soon as the practic requir can be met the aliment is the most affection in love and the thorac the most flirtati but the muscular is the most posit the fatal handicap ¶ the muscular has more strong trait than ani other type from the marit point of view but he has one weak of such magnitud that it often counterbal them his pugnac caus him to give way frequent to violent outburst of anger in them he say bitter thing that are almost imposs to forgiv this type chief handicap in all his relat is his tendenc to fight too quick to say too much when angri and thus to make enemi in marriag this is a serious handicap which lose mani an otherwis ideal husband or wife the chanc for happi anoth muscular trait which make life difficult for his mate is his tendenc to be so generous with outsid that his famili suffer also this type of husband or wife is inclin to sacrific the social side of famili life to work and thus widen the distanc between husband and wife as the year go on desir trait ¶ work capac generos and squar are qualiti make for the success of the muscular marriag the muscular wife more often than ani other help earn the live when thing go wrong financi the muscular usual dislik flirtat and give his mate littl anxieti on this score mate for muscular ¶ the muscular has four choic in the select of a mate there is but one type he should never marri and that is the osseous the stubbor of the osseous when pit against the muscular pugnac caus constant warfar the predomin muscular person should choos a mate who is also predomin muscular no other type aid him in the practic affair of the famili futur but it is well for him when this muscular has decid cerebr tendenc second choic for the muscular is a mate predomin cerebr the muscular in this case furnish the brawn to work out the plan made by the brain of the cerebr and the combin is one that stand a good chanc of happi third choic is the thorac and fourth choic the aliment part four the osseous in love ¶ bring to mind all the men and women you have known who wait ten twenti or thirti year for the one they had given their heart to you will recal that they all had larg bone or larg joint for their bodi such peopl are alway predomin osseous the love one may marri but the boni man or woman remain faith it must be the one they want or none the riddl solv ¶ this fact account for some of the incongru match in middl or later life of old friend who seem to be unfit to each other often one of them has wait mani year for the other to consent for children to grow up or for death to clear the way one lover through life ¶ osseous men and women are so constitut that it is practic imposs for them to love mani time dure a lifetim boni peopl even when young have fewer sweetheart than other type the larg bone boy or girl is usual ill at eas in the presenc of the other sex avoid social affair and doe not attract love as earli in life as other type do they suffer keen from the near ostrac result from this but are powerless to chang it live apart from other ¶ becaus they live more or less apart from their fellow even as children and tend to withdraw into themselv the osseous see littl of the other sex learn littl about it and come to think of it as unapproach as we have seen the aliment feel at eas with the other sex the thorac charm them the muscular cultiv them when he is in earnest but the osseous avoid them if he doe not marri he becom more and more awkward in their presenc as he grow older such a person will often go a block out of his way to avoid meet a person of the opposit sex marri less often ¶ this natur lead to the unmat life which character so mani men and women of the osseous type we ask you to recal the one or two aliment bachelor and spinster you ever knew the three or four thorac and the not more than half a dozen muscular who didnt marri but it will take some time to enumer the osseous peopl you know who have never marri this type constitut a veri larg proport of the unmarri most difficult to live with ¶ when the osseous doe marri he is the most difficult of all type to live with becaus he is inclin to be immov and unbend to give and take has long been consid the secret of happi marriag and certain is one of them but this type find it almost imposs to adapt himself to his mate he want everyth in a certain way at a certain time and for a certain purpos whoever oppos him is pretti ruthless handl anoth marit liabil of this type is his disinclin and inabl to make new friend he contribut to the famili circl onli those few intim he has had for year like to domin ¶ the osseous is inclin to domin and often to domin over his mate and over his famili in general this is as true of the women as of the men as we have seen type and not sex is what caus the big distinct between peopl the hen peck husband ¶ whenev you see a hen peck husband look at his wife you will alway find that she has either larg joint larg bone or a squar jaw mani time we have heard men declar they would show such a wife how to act but unless they could chang her boni they would find it difficult to show her much of anyth the reason the husband of such a woman seldom resist is becaus he is nine time out of ten an aliment or a cerebraltyp that prefer to be boss rather than to boss the same combin is usual present when the husband domin the wife he is almost invari boni and she is either aliment or cerebr and other women say id like to show such a husband what i would do if he tri to tyrann over me as he doe over her but such a woman often prefer a husband who reliev her of the respons of decis and two such peopl sometim lead surpris happi live togeth mate for the osseous ¶ therefor the type best fit to live in harmoni with the predomin osseous is the predomin aliment second choic is the predomin cerebr for the reason state abov there is no third choic the pure osseous and pure thorac should not marri becaus they are too far remov from each other in all their tendenc ever to understand each other the one type the pure osseous should never mate with is his own noth but troubl result when two of the extrem boni type marri for each has definit view desir and preferencesand neither can give in part five love and the cerebr ¶ the cerebr type take most of his love out in dream he is as impract about his affect as about all els and often noth but hope come of it next to the osseous he marri less frequent than ani other type head and heart in the cloud ¶ the cerebr often remain singl becaus he can not come down to earth long enough to propos or if he doe he is so gentl and timid about it the girl is afraid to trust her life to him timid his curs ¶ timid cost the cerebr man most of the good thing he could otherwis get out of life he is almost afraid to fall in love afraid to speak after he doe and afraid to face the hostil world with two live on his hand women like him ¶ the averag woman like the cerebr type of man but seldom love or ador him his helpless appeal to her mother sympathi can not buffet the world ¶ but women are afraid to marri the extrem type even when the feel he prompt is more than mere protect they know he can not buffet the world for them and their offspr so even when they love him best they usual marri the fat salesman the muscular worker who alway has a good job the thorac promot who promis luxuri or the osseous man who wont take no for an answer alway leap year for him ¶ when this type of man doe marri it is often due as much to her propos as his he is especi aid in his courtship if she happen to be a quick spoken thorac a straight from the shoulder muscular or one of those determin osseous girl the much love cerebr woman ¶ the cerebr woman is more fortun in achiev marriag than the cerebr man the impract which so serious handicap him sinc the husband is suppos to support the famili is not quit so much of a handicap to her men who love her at all love her for her tender conscienti and delicaci and deem it a pleasur to work for her and she is one type of woman who usual appreci it the cerebr weak ¶ the tendenc to dream his life away instead of do tangibl thing that assist in the progress of the famili is the greatest marit handicap of the cerebr type inabl to make money result direct from this and sinc money is so import in the rear and educ of children those who can not get it are bound to face hardship and disillusion the saddest sight ¶ the most pathet sight to be seen anywher is that of the delic intellectu man who love his famili dear has the highest ideal and yet is unabl to provid for them when love fli out the window ¶ when poverti come in the door love fli out the window is a say as old as it is sad ¶ and it is as true as it is both old and sad despit the philosopherswho are all cerebr themselveslov should grow in shelter soil protect from the buffet of wind and storm without mean no man can provid this protect happi marriag as we have seen is base on the cultiv of the strong point and the submerg of the weak one of each partner poverti doe more to bring out the worst in peopl and conceal the best than anyth els in the world so although this type is high mind more idealist in his love than ani other type and has fewer of the lower instinct he make less of a success of marriag than ani other type mate for the cerebr ¶ becaus he live in his mind and not in his extern world the predomin cerebr must marri one who also is predomin cerebr the read of book attend at good play and the studi of great movement constitut the chief enjoy of this type and if he has a mate who care noth for these thing his marriag is bound to be a failur the cerebr he marri should howev be inclin to the muscular also second choic for this type is the predomin muscular and third choic is the osseous the firm of the latter is often a desir element in the combin for the cerebr doe not mind give the rein over to his osseous mate he doe not like drive anyhow the last type of all for the pure cerebr to marri is the pure aliment becaus it is farthest remov from his own type these two have veri littl in common rememb in marriag type is not a substitut for love both are essenti to ideal mate peopl contempl matrimoni are like two autoist plan a long journey togeth each drive his own car whether they can make the same speed climb the same grade on high and be well match in general depend on the type of these two car but it take love to suppli the gas the self starter and the spark plug chapter vii vocat for each type fame and failur the mass of mankind form a vast

contempl if you do not you will never succeed in this line of work thought it would do him good ¶ one incid will serv to illustr the forego test a young man ask us if he could succeed as a public speaker he had decid to becom a lectur and had spent two year studi for that work do you enjoy talk do you like to explain and expati when out with other do you furnish your share of the convers or a littl more were the question we put to him to all of the question he answer no but i thought this was just the line of work i ought to go into he explain i have alway been diffid and i thought the

to hit upon the thing for which she unquestion had no abil she said i thought it would give me a world outlook which i need compel me to learn fabric someth i think everi woman ought to know forc me to attend to detail which i have alway hate but which i must learn to master and becaus it would bring me into contact with peopl i dislik them but think i should learn to deal with them when consid a

out of everi hundr applic for a vacanc ask no question of themselv whatev and onli one of anybodi els that question is to the employ and it is onli four word what doe it pay he overlook the fact that

better than the mass of peopl are do them today and whenev they find them they pay them wellbecaus it pay them in the long run the big salari men ¶ dont be afraid that you may develop abil and then find no market for it the onli job that have to go beg are the big salari one becaus the combin of intellig and effici is not easi to find the men who are draw from 10000 to 50000 a year are not supermen they are not veri differ from anybodi els but they found a line that fit their particular talent and they went ahead cultiv those talent without ask for everyth in advanc look for chicken feed ¶ while tour through the rocki last summer we came one day to a log shack perch on the mountain side near the road in the back yard was the owner just readi to feed his chicken as he flung out the grain they came from everi direct crowd and jostl each other and frantic peck for the tini morsel he threw on the ground sever dozen flock around him but three or four stay on the outer edg readi to scamper for the big grain he threw now and then amongst the boulder up on the hillsid i do that just to see them use their head he explain peopl are just like that they rush for the littl chanc where all the competit is instead of stay out where they can see a big chanc when it come life is full of opportun for everi person who will consult his own capac and aim for the big chanc caus of misfit ¶ various influenc are respons for the misfit chief amongst which are his love parent mani father and mother with the best intent in the world urg their children to enter vocat for which they have no natur fit whatev these same parent often discourag in their children the veri talent which if permit to develop would make them success such a child has small chanc in the world if it happen that his parent are suffici well to do to hold the purs string on his train not until he has fail at the work they choos for him will such parent desist when they final allow him to take to the work he prefer they are usual surpris to see how clever he is but if he doe not succeed at it they should bear in mind that it is doubtless due to their have cheat him out of his priceless youthth year when the mind is moldabl impression and full of inspir poverti one advantag ¶ in this situat alon doe the child of poverti ridden parent have greater opportun than the child of the well to do he at least choos his own work and this is one more littl reason whi the world most success men so often come from the rank of the poor ruin by too much mother and father is a verdict we would frequent render if we knew the fact richard and dorothi ¶ one instanc in which fate took a hand was veri interest a new york widow whose husband had left his larg fortun entir to her nurs definit ambit for her son and daughter richard she had decid should becom a stock raiser and farmer on the sever thousand acr ranch they own in texa dorothi should studi art in pari but it so happen that richard and
