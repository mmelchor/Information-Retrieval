these wish pill enquir the scarecrow take the box from his jacket pocket cant we use them to escap not unless we can count seventeen by twos answer the tin woodman but our friend the woggl bug claim to be high educ so he ought easili to figur out how that can be done it isnt a question of educ return the insect it mere a question of mathemat ive seen the professor work lot of sum on the blackboard and he claim anyth could be done with xs and ys and as and such thing by mix them up with plenti of pluss and minus and equal and so forth but he never said anyth so far as 225 i can rememb about count up to the odd number of seventeen by the even number of twos stop stop cri the pumpkinhead your make my head ach and mine ad the scarecrow your mathemat seem to me veri like a bottl of mix pickl the more you fish for what you want the less chanc you have of get it i am certain that if the thing can be accomplish at all it is in a veri simpl manner yes said tip old mombi couldnt use xs and minus for she never went to school whi not start count at a half of one ask the saw hors abrupt then anyon can count up to seventeen by twos veri easili they look at each other in surpris for the saw hors was consid the most stupid of the entir parti you make me quit asham of myself said the scarecrow bow low to the saw hors nevertheless the creatur is right declar the woggl bug for twice one half is one and if you get to one it is easi to count from one up to seventeen by twos i wonder i didnt think of that myself said the pumpkinhead 226 i dont return the scarecrow your no wiser than the

paint on and there no swallow connect with it answer the scarecrow in fact he continu look from one to anoth critic i believ the boy and the woggl bug are the onli one in our parti that are abl to swallow observ the truth of this remark tip said then i will undertak to make the first wish give me one of the silver pill this the scarecrow tri to do but his pad glove were too clumsi to clutch so small an object and he held the box toward the boy while tip select one of the pill and swallow it count cri the scarecrow one half one three five seven nine eleven count tip thirteen fifteen seventeen now wish said the tin woodman anxious but just then the boy began to suffer such fear pain that he becam alarm 227 the pill has poison me he gasp oh o o o o o ouch murder fire o o h and here he roll upon the bottom of the nest in such contort that he frighten them all what can we do for you speak i beg entreat the tin woodman tear of sympathi run down his nickel cheek ii dont know answer

if you have never swallow it the pill can not have given you a pain and as your wish be grant prove you did not swallow the pill it is also plain that you suffer no pain then it was a splendid imit of a pain retort tip angrili suppos you tri the next pill yourself weve wast one wish alreadi oh no we havent protest the scarecrow here are still three pill in the box and each pill is good for a wish now your make my head ach said tip i cant understand the thing at all but i wont take anoth pill i promis you and with this remark he retir sulkili to the back of the nest well said the woggl bug it remain for me to save us in my most high magnifi and thorough educ manner for i seem to be the onli one abl and will to make a wish let me have one of the pill he swallow it without hesit and they all stood admir his courag while the insect count seventeen by twos in the same way that tip had done and for some reasonperhap becaus woggl bug have stronger stomach than boysth silver pellet caus it no pain whatev i wish the gump broken wing mend and 229 as good as new said the woggl bug in a slow impress voic all turn to look at the thing and so quick had the wish been grant that the gump lay befor them in perfect repair and as well abl to fli through the air as when it had first been brought to life on the roof of the palac line art draw 230 full page line art draw 231 the scarecrow appeal to glenda the good hooray shout the scarecrow gaili we can now leav this miser jackdaw nest whenev we pleas but it is near dark said the tin woodman and unless we wait until morn to make our flight we may get into more troubl i dont like these night trip for one never know what will happen so it was decid to wait until daylight and the adventur amus themselv in the twilight by search the jackdaw nest for treasur the woggl bug found two handsom bracelet of wrought gold which fit his slender arm veri well the scarecrow took a fanci for ring of which there were mani in the nest befor long he 232 had fit a ring to each finger of his pad glove and not be content with that display he ad one more to each thumb as he care chose those ring set with sparkl stone such as rubi amethyst and sapphir the scarecrow hand now present a most brilliant appear this nest would be a picnic for queen jinjur said he muse for as near as i can make out she and her girl conquer me mere to rob my citi of it emerald the tin woodman was content with his diamond necklac and refus to accept ani addit decor but tip secur a fine gold watch which was attach to a heavi fob and place it in his pocket with much pride he also pin sever jewel brooch to jack pumpkinhead red waistcoat and attach a lorgnett by mean of a fine chain to the neck of the saw hors it veri pretti said the creatur regard the lorgnett approv but what is it for none of them could answer that question howev so the saw hors decid it was some rare decor and becam veri fond of it that none of the parti might be slight they end by place sever larg seal ring upon the point of the gump antler although that odd 233 personag seem by no mean gratifi by the attent dark soon fell upon them and tip and the woggl bug went to sleep while the other sat down to wait patient for the day next morn they had caus to congratul themselv upon the use condit of the gump for with daylight a great flock of jackdaw approach to engag in one more battl for the possess of the nest but our adventur did not wait for the assault they tumbl into the cushion seat of the sofa as quick as possibl and tip gave the word to the gump to start at onc it rose into the air the great wing flop strong and with regular motion and in a few moment they were so far from the nest that the chatter jackdaw took possess without ani attempt at pursuit the thing flew due north go in the same direct from whenc it had come at least that was the scarecrow opinion and the other agre that the scarecrow was the best judg of direct after pass over sever citi and villag the gump carri them high abov a broad plain where hous becam more and more scatter until they 234 disappear altogeth next came the wide sandi desert separ the rest of the world from the land of oz and befor noon they saw the dome shape hous that prove they were onc more within the border of their nativ land but the hous and fenc are blue said the tin woodman and that indic we are in the land of the munchkin and therefor a long distanc from glinda the good what shall we do ask the boy turn to their guid i dont know repli the scarecrow frank if we were at the emerald citi we could then move direct southward and so reach our destin but we dare not go to the emerald citi and the gump is probabl carri us further in the wrong direct with everi flop of it wing then the woggl bug must swallow anoth pill said tip decid and wish us head in the right direct veri well return the high magnifi one im will but when the scarecrow search in his pocket for the pepper box contain the two silver wish pill

the educ high magnifi woggl bug saunter behind in a dignifi manner tip walk by the side of the sorceress for glinda had conceiv a great like for the boy of cours old mombi had no intent of be found by
