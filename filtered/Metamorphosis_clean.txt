then turn to look out the window at the dull weather drop of rain could be heard hit the pane which made him feel quit sad how about if i sleep a littl bit longer and forget all this nonsens he thought but that was someth he was unabl to do becaus he was use to sleep on his right and in his present state couldnt get into that posit howev hard he threw himself onto his right he alway roll back to where he was he must have tri it a hundr time shut his eye so that he wouldnt have to look at the flounder leg and onli stop when he began to feel a mild dull pain there that he had never felt

slight itch up on his belli push himself slowli up on his back toward the headboard so that he could lift his head better found where the itch was and saw that it was cover with lot of littl white spot which he didnt know what to make of and when he tri to feel the place with one of his leg he drew it quick back becaus as soon as he touch it he was overcom by a cold shudder he slid back into his former posit get up earli all the time he thought it make you stupid youv got to get enough sleep other travel salesmen live a life of luxuri for instanc whenev i go back to the guest hous dure the morn to copi out the contract these gentlemen are alway still sit there eat their breakfast i ought to just tri that with my boss id get kick out on the spot but who know mayb that would be the best thing for me if i didnt have my parent to think about id have given in my notic a long time ago id have gone up to the boss and told him just what i think tell him everyth i would let him know just what i feel hed fall right off his desk and it a funni sort of busi to be sit up there at your desk talk down at your subordin from up there especi when you have to go right up close becaus the boss is hard of hear well there still some hope onc ive got the money togeth to pay off my parent debt to him anoth five or six year i suppos that definit what ill do that when ill make the big chang first of all though ive got to get up my train leav at five and he look over at the alarm clock tick on the chest of drawer god in heaven he thought it was half past six and the hand were quiet move forward it was even later than half past more like quarter to seven had the alarm clock not rung he could see from the bed that it had been set for four oclock as it should have been it certain must have rung yes but was it possibl to quiet sleep through that furnitur rattl nois true he had not slept peac but probabl all the more deepli becaus of that what should he do now the next train went at seven if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collect of sampl was still not pack and he did not at all feel particular fresh and live and even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his bosss anger as the offic assist would have been there to see the five oclock train go he would have put in his report about gregor not be there a long time ago the offic assist was the bosss man spineless and with no understand what about if he report sick but that would be extrem strain and suspici as in fifteen year of servic gregor had never onc yet been ill his boss would certain come round with the doctor from the medic insur compani accus his parent of have a lazi son and accept the doctor recommend not to make ani claim as the doctor believ that no one was ever ill but that mani were workshi and what more would he have been entir wrong in this case gregor did in fact apart from excess sleepi after sleep for so long feel complet well and even felt much hungrier than usual he was still hurri think all this through unabl to decid to get out of the bed when the clock struck quarter to seven there was a cautious knock at the door near his head gregor somebodi call it was his mother it quarter to seven didnt you want to go somewher that gentl voic gregor was shock when he heard his own voic answer it could hard be recognis as the voic he had had befor as if from deep insid him there was a pain and uncontrol squeak mix in with it the word could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear leav the hearer unsur whether he had heard proper or not gregor had want to give a full answer and explain everyth but in the circumst content himself with say yes mother yes thank you im get up now the chang in gregor voic probabl could not be notic outsid through the wooden door as his mother was satisfi with this explan and shuffl away but this short convers made the other member of the famili awar that gregor against their expect was still at home and soon his father came knock at one of the side door gentl but with his fist gregor gregor he call what wrong and after a short while he call again with a warn deep in his voic gregor gregor at the other side door his sister came plaintiv gregor arent you well do you need anyth gregor answer to both side im readi now make an effort to remov all the strang from his voic by enunci veri care and put long paus between each individu word his father went back to his breakfast but his sister whisper gregor open the door i beg of you gregor howev had no thought of open the door and instead congratul himself for his cautious habit acquir from his travel of lock all door at night even when he was at home the first thing he want to do was to get up in peac without be disturb to get dress and most of all to have his breakfast onli then would he consid what to do next as he was well awar that he would not bring his thought to ani sensibl conclus by lie in bed he rememb that he had often felt a slight pain in bed perhap caus by lie awkward but that had alway turn out to be pure imagin and he wonder how his imagin would slowli resolv themselv today he did not have the slightest doubt that the chang in his voic was noth more than the first sign of a serious cold which was an occup hazard for travel salesmen it was a simpl matter to throw off the cover he onli had to blow himself up a littl and they fell off by themselv but it becam difficult after that especi as he was so except broad he would have use his arm and his hand to push himself up but instead of them he onli had all those littl leg continu move in differ direct and which he was moreov unabl to control if he want to bend one of them then that was the first one that would stretch itself out and if he final manag to do what he want with that leg all the other seem to be set free and would move about pain this is someth that cant be done in bed gregor said to himself so dont keep tri to do it the first thing he want to do was get the lower part of his bodi out of the bed but he had never seen this lower part and could not imagin what it look like it turn out to be too hard to move it went so slowli and final almost in a frenzi when he careless shove himself forward with all the forc he could gather he chose the wrong direct hit hard against the lower bedpost and learn from the burn pain he felt that the lower part of his bodi might well at present be the most sensit so then he tri to get the top part of his bodi out of the bed first care turn his head to the side this he manag quit easili and despit it breadth and it weight the bulk of his bodi eventu follow slowli in the direct of the head but when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occur to him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracl if his head were not injur so he becam afraid to carri on push himself forward the same way and he could not knock himself out now at ani price better to stay in bed than lose conscious it took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier but when he lay there sigh and was onc more watch his leg as they struggl against each other even harder than befor if that was possibl he could think of no way of bring peac and order to this chao he told himself onc more that it was not possibl for him to stay in bed and that the most sensibl thing to do would be to get free of it in whatev way he could at whatev sacrific at the same time though he did not forget to remind himself that calm consider was much better than rush to desper conclus at time like this he would direct his eye to the window and look out as clear as he could but unfortun even the other side of the narrow street was envelop in morn fog and the view had littl confid or cheer to offer him seven oclock alreadi he said to himself when the clock struck again seven oclock and there still a fog like this and he lay there quiet a while longer breath light as if he perhap expect the total still to bring thing back to their real and natur state but then he said to himself befor it strike quarter past seven ill definit have to have got proper out of bed and by then somebodi will have come round from work to ask what happen to me as well as they open up at work befor seven oclock and so he set himself to the task of swing the entir length of his bodi out of the bed all at the same time if he succeed in fall out of bed in this way and kept his head rais as he did so he could probabl avoid injur it his back seem to be quit hard and probabl noth would happen to it fall onto the carpet his main concern was for the loud nois he was bound to make and which even through all the door would probabl rais concern if not alarm but it was someth that had to be risk when gregor was alreadi stick half way out of the bed the new method was more of a game than an effort all he had to do was rock back and forth it occur to him how simpl everyth would be if somebodi came to help him two strong peopl he had his father and the maid in mind would have been more than enough they would onli have to push their arm under the dome of his back peel him away from the bed bend down with the load and then be patient and care as he swang over onto the floor where hope the littl leg would find a use should he realli call for help though even apart from the fact that all the door were lock despit all the difficulti he was in he could not suppress a smile at this thought after a while he had alreadi move so far across that it would have been hard for him to keep his balanc if he rock too hard the time was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decis veri soon then there was a ring at the door of the flat thatll be someon from work he said to himself and froze veri still although his littl leg onli becam all the more live as they danc around for a moment everyth remain quiet theyr not open the door gregor said to himself caught in some nonsens hope but then of cours the maid firm step went to the door as ever and open it gregor onli need to hear the visitor first word of greet and he knew who it was the chief clerk himself whi did gregor have to be the onli one condemn to work for a compani where they immedi becam high suspici at the slightest shortcom were all employe everi one of them lout was there not one of them who was faith and devot who would go so mad with pang of conscienc that he couldnt get out of bed if he didnt spend at least a coupl of hour in the morn on compani busi was it realli not enough to let one of the traine make enquiri assum enquiri were even necessari did the chief clerk have to come himself and did they have to show the whole innoc famili that this was so suspici that onli the chief clerk could be trust to have the wisdom to investig it and more becaus these thought had made him upset than through ani proper decis he swang himself with all his forc out of the bed there was a loud thump but it wasnt realli a loud nois his fall was soften a littl by the carpet and gregor back was also more elast than he had thought which made the sound muffl and not too notic he had not held his head care enough though and hit it as he fell annoy and in pain he turn it and rub it against the carpet someth fallen down in there said the chief clerk in the room on the left gregor tri to imagin whether someth of the sort that had happen to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too you had to conced that it was possibl but as if in gruff repli to this question the chief clerk firm footstep in his high polish boot could now be heard in the adjoin room from the room on his right gregor sister whisper to him to let him know gregor the chief clerk is here yes i know said gregor to himself but without dare to rais his voic loud enough for his sister to hear him gregor said his father now from the room to his left the chief clerk has come round and want to know whi you didnt leav on the earli train we dont know what to say to him and anyway he want to speak to you person so pleas open up this door im sure hell be good enough to forgiv the untidi of your room then the chief clerk call good morn mr samsa he isnt well said his mother to the chief clerk while his father continu to speak through the door he isnt well pleas believ me whi els would gregor have miss a train the lad onli ever think about the busi it near make me cross the way he never goe out in the even hes been in town for a week now but stay home everi even he sit with us in the kitchen and just read the paper or studi train timet his idea of relax is work with his fretsaw hes made a littl frame for instanc it onli took him two or three even youll be amaz how nice it is

he said this morn that he is but he isnt ill be there in a moment said gregor slowli and thought but without move so that he would not miss ani word of the convers well i cant think of ani other way of explain it mrs samsa said the chief clerk i hope it noth serious but on the other hand i must say that if we peopl in commerc ever becom slight unwel then fortun or unfortun as you like we simpli have to overcom it becaus of busi consider can the chief clerk come in to see you now then ask his father impati knock at the door again no said gregor in the room on his right there follow a pain silenc in the room on his left his sister began to cri so whi did his sister not go and join the other she had probabl onli just got up and had not even begun to get dress and whi was she cri was it becaus he had not got up and had not let the chief clerk in becaus he was in danger of lose his job and if that happen his boss would onc more pursu their parent with the same demand as befor there was no need to worri about thing like that yet gregor was still there and had not the slightest intent of abandon his famili for the time be he just lay there on the carpet and no one who knew the condit he was in would serious have expect him to let the chief clerk in it was onli a minor discourtesi and a suitabl excus could easili be found for it later on it was not someth for which gregor could be sack on the spot and it seem to gregor much more sensibl to leav him now in peac instead of disturb him with talk at him and cri but the other didnt know what was happen they were worri that would excus their behaviour the chief clerk now rais his voic mr samsa he call to him what is wrong you barricad yourself in your room give us no more than yes or no for an answer you are caus serious

this morn your employ did suggest a possibl reason for your failur to appear it true it had to do with the money that was recent entrust to you but i came near to give him my word of honour that that could not be the right explan but now that i see your incomprehens stubborn i no longer feel ani wish whatsoev to interced on your behalf and nor is your posit all that secur i had origin intend to say all this to you in privat but sinc you caus me to wast my time here for no good reason i dont see whi your parent should not also learn of it your turnov has been veri unsatisfactori of late i grant you that it not the time of year to do especi good busi we recognis that but there simpli is no time of year to do no busi at all mr samsa we cannot allow there to be but sir call gregor besid himself and forget all els in the excit ill open up immedi just a moment im slight unwel an attack of dizzi i havent been abl to get up im still in bed now im quit fresh again now though im just get

recommend me to him and while gregor gush out these word hard know what he was say he made his way over to the chest of drawer this was easili done probabl becaus of the practis he had alreadi had in bed where he now tri to get himself upright he realli did want to open the door realli did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk the other were be so insist and he was curious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him if they were shock then it would no longer be gregor respons and he could rest if howev they took everyth calm he would still have no reason to be upset and if he hurri he realli could be at the station for eight oclock the first few time he tri to climb up on the smooth chest of drawer he just slid down again but he final gave himself one last swing and stood there upright the lower part of his bodi was in serious pain but he no longer gave ani attent to it now he let himself fall against the back of a nearbi chair and held tight to the edg of it with his littl leg by now he had also calm down and kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was say did you understand a word of all that the chief clerk ask his parent sure hes not tri to make fool of us oh god call his mother who was alreadi in tear he could be serious ill and were make him suffer grete grete she then cri mother his sister call from the other side they communic across gregor room youll have to go for the doctor straight away gregor is ill quick get the doctor did you hear the way gregor spoke just now that was the voic of an anim said the chief clerk with a calm that was in contrast with his mother scream anna anna his father call into the kitchen through the entranc hall clap his hand get a locksmith here now and the two girl their skirt swish immedi ran out through the hall wrench open the front door of the flat as they went how had his sister manag to get dress so quick there was no sound of the door bang shut again they must have left it open peopl often do in home where someth aw has happen gregor in contrast had becom much calmer so they couldnt understand his word ani more although they seem clear enough to him clearer than befor perhap his ear had becom use to the sound they had realis though that there was someth wrong with him and were readi to help the first respons to his situat had been confid and wise and that made him feel better he felt that he had been drawn back in among peopl and from the doctor and the locksmith he expect great and surpris achiev although he did not realli distinguish one from the other whatev was said next would be crucial so in order to make his voic as clear as possibl he cough a littl but take care to do this not too loud as even this might well sound differ from the way that a human cough and he was no longer sure he could judg this for himself meanwhil it had becom veri quiet in the next room perhap his parent were sat at the tabl whisper with the chief clerk or perhap they were all press against the door and listen gregor slowli push his way over to the door with the chair onc there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door hold himself upright against it use the adhes on the tip of his leg he rest there a littl while to recov from the effort involv and then set himself to the task of turn the key in the lock with his mouth he seem unfortun to have no proper teeth how was he then to grasp the key but the lack of teeth was of cours made up for with a veri strong jaw use the jaw he realli was abl to start the key turn ignor the fact that he must have been caus some kind of damag as a brown fluid came from his mouth flow over the key and drip onto the floor listen said the chief clerk in the next room hes turn the key gregor was great encourag by this but they all should have been call to him his father and his mother too well done gregor they should have cri keep at it keep hold of the lock and with the idea that they

with his mouth and hung onto the key or push it down again with the whole weight of his bodi as need the clear sound of the lock as it snap back was gregor sign that he could break his concentr and as he regain his breath he said to himself so i didnt need the locksmith after all then he lay his head on the handl of the door to open it complet becaus he had to open the door in this way it was alreadi wide open befor he could be seen he had first to slowli turn himself around one of the doubl door and he had to do it veri care if he did not want to fall flat on his back befor enter the room he was still occupi with this difficult movement unabl to pay attent to anyth els when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud oh which sound like the sough of the wind now he also saw him he was the nearest to the door his hand press against his open mouth and slowli retreat as if driven by a steadi and invis forc gregor mother her hair still dishevel from bed despit the chief clerk be there look at his father then she unfold her arm took two step forward toward gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirt that spread themselv out around her as her head disappear down onto her breast his father look hostil and clench his fist as if want to knock gregor back into his room then he look uncertain round the live room cover his eye with his hand and wept so that his power chest shook so gregor did not go into the room but leant against the insid of the other door which was still held bolt in place in this way onli half of his bodi could be seen along with his head abov it which he leant over to one side as he peer out at the other meanwhil the day had becom much lighter part of the endless grey black build on the other side of the street which was a hospit could be seen quit clear with the auster and regular line of window pierc it facad the rain was still fall now throw down larg individu droplet which hit the ground one at a time the wash up from breakfast lay on the tabl there was so much of it becaus for gregor father breakfast was the most import meal of the day and he would stretch it out for sever hour as he sat read a number of differ newspap on the wall exact opposit there was photograph of gregor when he was a lieuten in the armi his sword in his hand and a carefre smile on his face as he call forth respect for his uniform and bear the door to the entranc hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the land and the stair where they began their way down below now then said gregor well awar that he was the onli one to have kept calm ill get dress straight away now pack up my sampl and set off will you pleas just let me leav you can see he said to the chief clerk that im not stubborn and i like to do my job be a commerci travel is arduous but without travel i couldnt earn my live so where are you go in to the offic yes will you report everyth accur then it quit possibl for someon to be temporarili unabl to work but that just the right time to rememb what been achiev in the past and consid that later on onc the difficulti has been remov he will certain work with all the more dilig and concentr your well awar that im serious in debt to our employ as well as have to look after my parent and my sister so that im trap in a difficult situat but i will work my way out of it again pleas dont make thing ani harder for me than they are alreadi and dont take side against me at the offic i know that nobodi like the travel they think we earn an enorm wage as well as have a soft time of it that just prejudic but they have no particular reason to think better of it but you sir you have a better overview than the rest of the staff in fact if i can say this in confid a better overview than the boss himself it veri easi for a businessman like him to make mistak about his employe and judg them more harsh than he should and your also well awar that we travel spend almost the whole year away from the offic so that we can veri easili fall victim to gossip and chanc and groundless complaint and it almost imposs to defend yourself from that sort of thing we dont usual even hear about them or if at all it when we arriv back home exhaust from a trip and that when we feel the harm effect of what been go on without even know what caus them pleas dont go away at least first say someth to show that you grant that im at least part right but the chief clerk had turn away as soon as gregor had start to speak and with protrud lip onli stare back at him over his trembl shoulder as he left he did not keep still for a moment while gregor was speak but move steadili toward the door without take his eye off him he move veri gradual as if there had been some secret prohibit on leav the room it was onli when he had reach the entranc hall that he made a sudden movement drew his foot from the live room and rush forward in a panic in the hall he stretch his right hand far out toward the stairway as if out there there were some supernatur forc wait to save him gregor realis that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if his posit in the firm was not to be put into extrem danger that was someth his parent did not understand veri well over the year they had becom convinc that this job would provid for gregor for his entir life and besid they had so much to worri about at present that they had lost sight of ani thought for the futur gregor though did think about the futur the chief clerk had to be held back calm down convinc and final won over the futur of gregor and his famili depend on it if onli his sister were here she was clever she was alreadi in tear while gregor was still lie peac on his back and the chief clerk was a lover of women sure she could persuad him she would close the front door in the entranc hall and talk him out of his shock state but his sister was not there gregor would have to do the job himself and without consid that he still was not familiar with how well he could move about in his present state or that his speech still might not or probabl would not be understood he let go of the door push himself through the open tri to reach the chief clerk on the land who ridicul was hold on to the banist with both hand but gregor fell immedi over and with a littl scream as he sought someth to hold onto land on his numer littl leg hard had that happen than for the first time that day he began to feel alright with his bodi the littl leg had the solid ground under them to his pleasur they did exact as he told them they were even make the effort to carri him where he want to go and he was soon believ that all his sorrow would soon be final at an end he held back the urg to move but sway from side to side as he crouch there on the floor his mother was not far away in front of him and seem at first quit engross in herself but then she sudden jump up with her arm outstretch and her finger spread shout help for piti sake help the way she held her head suggest she want to see gregor better but the unthink way she was hurri backward show that she did not she had forgotten that the tabl was behind her with all the breakfast thing on it when she reach the tabl she sat quick down on it without know what she was do without even seem to notic that the coffe pot had been knock over and a gush of coffe was pour down onto the carpet mother mother said gregor gentl look up at her he had complet forgotten the chief clerk for the moment but could not help himself snap in the air with his jaw at the sight of the flow of coffe that set his mother scream anew she fled from the tabl and into the arm of his father as he rush toward her gregor though had no time to spare for his parent now the chief clerk had alreadi reach the stair with his chin on the banist he look back for the last time gregor made a run for him he want to be sure of reach him the chief clerk must have expect someth as he leapt down sever step at onc and disappear his shout resound all around the staircas the flight of the chief clerk seem unfortun to put gregor father into a panic as well until then he had been relat self control but now instead of run after the chief clerk himself or at least not imped gregor as he ran after him gregor father seiz the chief clerk stick in his right hand the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair along with his hat and overcoat pick up a larg newspap from the tabl with his left and use them to drive gregor back into his room stamp his foot at him as he went gregor appeal to his father were of no help his appeal were simpli not understood howev much he humbl turn his head his father mere stamp his foot all the harder across the room despit the chilli weather gregor mother had pull open a window leant far out of it and press her hand to her face a strong draught of air flew in from the street toward the stairway the curtain flew up the newspap on the tabl flutter and some of them were blown onto the floor noth would stop gregor father as he drove him back make hiss nois at him like a wild man gregor had never had ani practic in move backward and was onli abl to go veri slowli if gregor had onli been allow to turn round he would have been back in his room straight away but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that his father would becom impati and there was the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father hand ani moment eventu though gregor realis that he had no choic as he saw to his disgust that he was quit incap of go backward in a straight line so he began as quick as possibl and with frequent anxious glanc at his father to turn himself round it went veri slowli but perhap his father was abl to see his good intent as he did noth to hinder him in fact now and then he use the tip of his stick to give direct from a distanc as to which way to turn if onli his father would stop that unbear hiss it was make gregor quit confus when he had near finish turn round still listen to that hiss he made a mistak and turn himself back a littl the way he had just come he was pleas when he final had his head in front of the doorway but then saw that it was too narrow and his bodi was too broad to get through it without further difficulti in his present mood it obvious did not occur to his father to open the other of the doubl door so that gregor would have enough space to get through he was mere fix on the idea that gregor should be got back into his room as quick as possibl nor would he ever have allow gregor the time to get himself upright as prepar for get through the doorway what he did make more nois than ever was to drive gregor forward all the harder as if there had been noth in the way it sound to gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him it was not a pleasant experi and gregor push himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen one side of his bodi lift itself he lay at an angl in the doorway one flank scrape on the white door and was pain injur leav vile brown fleck on it soon he was stuck fast and would not have been abl to move at all by himself the littl leg along one side hung quiver in the air while those on the other side were press pain against the ground then his father gave him a hefti shove from behind which releas him from where he was held and sent him fli and heavili bleed deep into his room the door was slam shut with the stick then final all was quiet ii it was not until it was get dark that even that gregor awok from his deep and coma like sleep he would have woken soon afterward anyway even if he hadnt been disturb as he had had enough sleep and felt fulli rest but he had the impress that some hurri step and the sound of the door lead into the front room be care shut had woken him the light from the electr street lamp shone pale here and there onto the ceil and top of the furnitur but down below where gregor was it was dark he push himself over to the door feel his way clumsili with his antenna of which he was now begin to learn the valu in order to see what had been happen there the whole of his left side seem like one pain stretch scar and he limp bad on his two row of leg one of the leg had been bad injur in the event of that morn it was near a miracl that onli one of them had been and drag along lifeless it was onli when he had reach the door that he realis what it actual was that had drawn him over to it it was the smell of someth to eat by the door there was a dish fill with sweeten milk with littl piec of white bread float in it he was so pleas he almost laugh as he was even hungrier than he had been that morn and immedi dip his head into the milk near cover his eye with it but he soon drew his head back again in disappoint not onli did the pain in his tender left side make it difficult to eat the food he was onli abl to eat if his whole bodi work togeth as a snuffl whole but the milk did not tast at all nice milk like this was normal his favourit drink and his sister had certain left it there for him becaus of that but he turn almost against his own will away from the dish and crawl back into the centr of the room through the crack in the door gregor could see that the gas had been lit in the live room his father at this time would normal be sat with his even paper read it out in a loud voic to gregor mother and sometim to his sister but there was now not a sound to be heard gregor sister would often write and tell him about this read but mayb his father had lost the habit in recent time it was so quiet all around too even though there must have been somebodi in the flat what a quiet life it is the famili lead said gregor to himself and gaze into the dark felt a great pride that he was abl to provid a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and parent but what now if all this peac and wealth and comfort should come to a horribl and frighten end that was someth that gregor did not want to think about too much so he start to move about crawl up and down the room onc dure that long even the door on one side of the room was open veri slight and hurri close again later on the door on the other side did the same it seem that someon need to enter the room but thought better of it gregor went and wait immedi by the door resolv either to bring the timor visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it was but the door was open no more that night and gregor wait in vain the previous morn while the door were lock everyon had want to get in there to him but now now that he had open up one of the door and the other had clear been unlock some time dure the day no one came and the key were in the other side it was not until late at night that the gaslight in the live room was put out and now it was easi to see that his parent and sister had stay awak all that time as they all could be distinct heard as they went away togeth on tip toe it was clear that no one would come into gregor room ani more until morn that gave him plenti of time to think undisturb about how he would have to re arrang his life for some reason the tall empti room where he was forc to remain made him feel uneasi as he lay there flat on the floor even though he had been live in it for five year hard awar of what he was do other than a slight feel of shame he hurri under the couch it press down on his back a littl and he was no longer abl to lift his head but he nonetheless felt immedi at eas and his onli regret was that his bodi was too broad to get it all underneath he spent the whole night there some of the time he pass in a light sleep although he frequent woke from it in alarm becaus of his hunger and some of the time was spent in worri and vagu hope which howev alway led to the same conclus for the time be he must remain calm he must show patienc and the greatest consider so that his famili could bear the unpleas that he in his present condit was forc to impos on them gregor soon had the opportun to test the strength of his decis as earli the next morn almost befor the night had end his sister near fulli dress open the door from the front room and look anxious in she did not see him straight away but when she did notic him under the couch he had to be somewher for god sake he couldnt have flown away she was so shock that she lost control of herself and slam the door shut again from outsid but she seem to regret her behaviour as she open the door again straight away and came in on tip toe as if enter the room of someon serious ill or even of a stranger gregor had push his head forward right to the edg of the couch and watch her would she notic that he had left the milk as it was realis that it was not from ani lack of hunger and bring him in some other food that was more suitabl if she didnt do it herself he would rather go hungri than draw her attent to it although he did feel a terribl urg to rush forward from under the couch throw himself at his sister feet and beg her for someth good to eat howev his sister notic the full dish immedi and look at it and the few drop of milk splash around it with some surpris she immedi pick it up use a rag not her bare hand and carri it out gregor was extrem curious as to what she would bring in it place imagin the wildest possibl but he never could have guess what his sister in her good actual did bring in order to test his tast she brought him a whole select of thing all spread out on an old newspap there were old half rotten veget bone from the even meal cover in white sauc that had gone hard a few raisin and almond some chees that gregor had declar ined two day befor a dri roll and some bread spread with butter and salt as well as all that she had pour some water into the dish which had probabl been perman set asid for gregor use and place it besid them then out of consider for gregor feel as she knew that he would not eat in front of her she hurri out again and even turn the key in the lock so that gregor would know he could make thing as comfort for himself as he like gregor littl leg whir at last he could eat what more his injuri must alreadi have complet heal as he found no difficulti in move this amaz him as more than a month earlier he had cut his finger slight with a knife he thought of how his finger had still hurt the day befor yesterday am i less sensit than i use to be then he thought and was alreadi suck greedili at the chees which had immedi almost compel attract him much more than the other food on the newspap quick one after anoth his eye water with pleasur he consum the chees the veget and the sauc the fresh food on the other hand he didnt like at all and even drag the thing he did want to eat a littl way away from them becaus he couldnt stand the smell long after he had finish eat and lay letharg in the same place his sister slowli turn the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw he was immedi startl although he had been half asleep and he hurri back under the couch but he need great self control to stay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room as eat so much food had round out his bodi a littl and he could hard breath in that narrow space half suffoc he watch with bulg eye as his sister unselfconsci took a broom and swept up the left over mix them in with the food he had not even touch at all as if it could not be use ani more she quick drop it all into a bin close it with it wooden lid and carri everyth out she had hard turn her back befor gregor came out again from under the couch and stretch himself this was how gregor receiv his food each day now onc in the morn while his parent and the maid were still asleep and the second time after everyon had eaten their meal at midday as his parent would sleep for a littl while then as well and gregor sister would send the maid away on some errand gregor father and mother certain did not want him to starv either but perhap it would have been more than they could stand to have ani more experi of his feed than be told about it and perhap his sister want to spare them what distress she could as they were inde suffer enough it was imposs for gregor to find out what they had told the doctor and the locksmith that first morn to get them out of the flat as nobodi could understand him nobodi not even his sister thought that he could understand them so he had to be content to hear his sister sigh and appeal to the saint as she move about his room it was onli later when she had becom a littl more use to everyth there was of cours no question of her ever becom fulli use to the situat that gregor would sometim catch a friend comment or at least a comment that could be constru as friend hes enjoy his dinner today she might say when he had dilig clear away all the food left for him or if he left most of it which slowli becam more and more frequent she would often say sad now everyth just been left there again although gregor wasnt abl to hear ani news direct he did listen to much of what was said in the next room and whenev he heard anyon speak he would scurri straight to the appropri door and press his whole bodi against it there was seldom ani convers especi at first that was not about him in some way even if onli in secret for two whole day all the talk at everi mealtim was about what they should do now but even between meal they spoke about the same subject as there were alway at least two member of the famili at home nobodi want to be at home by themselv and it was out of the question to leav the flat entir empti and on the veri first day the maid had fallen to her knee and beg gregor mother to let her go without delay it was not veri clear how much she knew of what had happen but she left within a quarter of an hour tear thank gregor mother for her dismiss as if she had done her an enorm servic she even swore emphat not to tell anyon the slightest about what had happen even though no one had ask that of her now gregor sister also had to help his mother with the cook although that was not so much bother as no one ate veri much gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccess urg anoth to eat and receiv no more answer than no thank ive had enough or someth similar no one drank veri much either his sister would sometim ask his father whether he would like a beer hope for the chanc to go and fetch it herself when his father then said noth she would add so that he would not feel selfish that she could send the housekeep for it but then his father would close the matter with a big loud no and no more would be said even befor the first day had come to an end his father had explain to gregor mother and sister what their financ and prospect were now and then he stood up from the tabl and took some receipt or document from the littl cash box he had save from his busi when it had collaps five year earlier gregor heard how he open the complic lock and then close it again after he had taken the item he want what he heard his father say was some of the first good news that gregor heard sinc he had first been incarcer in his room he had thought that noth at all remain from his father busi at least he had never told him anyth differ and gregor had never ask him about it anyway their busi misfortun had reduc the famili to a state of total despair and gregor onli concern at that time had been to arrang thing so that they could all forget about it as quick as possibl so then he start work especi hard with a fieri vigour that rais him from a junior salesman to a travel repres almost overnight bring with it the chanc to earn money in quit differ way gregor convert his success at work straight into cash that he could lay on the tabl at home for the benefit of his astonish and delight famili they had been good time and they had never come again at least not with the same splendour even though gregor had later earn so much that he was in a posit to bear the cost of the whole famili and did bear them they had even got use to it both gregor and the famili they took the money with gratitud and he was glad to provid it although there was no longer much warm affect given in return gregor onli remain close to his sister now unlik him she was veri fond of music and a gift and express violinist it was his secret plan to send her to the conservatori next year even though it would caus great expens that would have to be made up for in some other way dure gregor short period in town convers with his sister would often turn to the conservatori but it was onli ever mention as a love dream that could never be realis their parent did not like to hear this innoc talk but gregor thought about it quit hard and decid he would let them know what he plan with a grand announc of it on christma day that was the sort of total pointless thing that went through his mind in his present state press upright against the door and listen there were time when he simpli becam too tire to continu listen when his head would fall wearili against the door and he would pull it up again with a start as even the slightest nois he caus would be heard next door and they would all go silent what that hes do now his father would say after a while clear have gone over to the door and onli then would the interrupt convers slowli be taken up again when explain thing his father repeat himself sever time part becaus it was a long time sinc he had been occupi with these matter himself and part becaus gregor mother did not understand everyth the first time from these repeat explan gregor learn to his pleasur that despit all their misfortun there was still some money avail from the old day it was not a lot but it had not been touch in the meantim and some interest had accumul besid that they had not been use up all the money that gregor had been bring home everi month keep onli a littl for himself so that that too had been accumul behind the door gregor nod with enthusiasm in his pleasur at this unexpect thrift and caution he could actual have use this surplus money to reduc his father debt to his boss and the day when he could have freed himself from that job would have come much closer but now it was certain better the way his father had done thing this money howev was certain not enough to enabl the famili to live off the interest it was enough to maintain them for perhap one or two year no more that to say it was money that should not realli be touch but set asid for emerg money to live on had to be earn his father was healthi but old and lack in self confid dure the five year that he had not been work the first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success he had put on a lot of weight and becom veri slow and clumsi would gregor elder mother now have to go and earn money she suffer from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home everi other day would be spent struggl for breath on the sofa by the open window would his sister have to go and earn money she was still a child of seventeen her life up till then had been veri enviabl consist of wear nice cloth sleep late help out in the busi join in with a few modest pleasur and most of all play the violin whenev they began to talk of the need to earn money gregor would alway first let go of the door and then throw himself onto the cool leather sofa next to it as he becam quit hot with shame and regret he would often lie there the whole night through not sleep a wink but scratch at the leather for hour on end or he might go to all the effort of push a chair to the window climb up onto the sill and prop up in the chair lean on the window to stare out of it he had use to feel a great sens of freedom from do this but do it now was obvious someth more rememb than experienc as what he actual saw in this way was becom less distinct everi day even thing that were quit near he had use to curs the ever present view of the hospit across the street but now he could not see it at all and if he had not known that he live in charlottenstrass which was a quiet street despit be in the middl of the citi he could have thought that he was look out the window at a barren wast where the grey sky and the grey earth mingl insepar his observ sister onli need to notic the chair twice befor she would alway push it back to it exact posit by the window after she had tidi up the room and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on if gregor had onli been abl to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it but as it was it caus him pain his sister natur tri as far as possibl to pretend there was noth burdensom about it and the longer it went on of cours the better she was abl to do so but as time went by gregor was also abl to see through it all so much better it had even becom veri unpleas for him now whenev she enter the room no sooner had she come in than she would quick close the door as a precaut so that no one would have to suffer the view into gregor room then she would go straight to the window and pull it hurri open almost as if she were suffoc even if it was cold she would stay at the window breath deepli for a littl while she would alarm gregor twice a day with this run about and nois make he would stay under the couch shiver the whole while know full well that she would certain have like to spare him this ordeal but it was imposs for her to be in the same room with him with the window close one day about a month after gregor transform when his sister no longer had ani particular reason to be shock at his appear she came into the room a littl earlier than usual and found him still stare out the window motionless and just where he would be most horribl in itself his sister not come into the room would have been no surpris for gregor as it would have been difficult for her to immedi open the window while he was still there but not onli did she not come in she went straight back and close the door behind her a stranger would have thought he had threaten her and tri to bite her gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch of cours but he had to wait until midday befor his sister came back and she seem much more uneasi than usual it made him realis that she still found his appear unbear and would continu to do so she probabl even had to overcom the urg to flee when she saw the littl bit of him that protrud from under the couch one day in order to spare her even this sight he spent four hour carri the bedsheet over to the couch on his back and arrang it so that he was complet cover and his sister would not be abl to see him even if she bent down if she did not think this sheet was necessari then all she had to do was take it off again as it was clear enough that it was no pleasur for gregor to cut himself off so complet she left the sheet where it was gregor even thought he glimps a look of gratitud one time when he care look out from under the sheet to see how his sister like the new arrang for the first fourteen day gregor parent could not bring themselv to come into the room to see him he would often hear them say how they appreci all the new work his sister was do even though befor they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequent been annoy with her but now the two of them father and mother would often both wait outsid the door of gregor room while his sister tidi up in there and as soon as she went out again she would have to tell them exact how everyth look what gregor had eaten how he had behav this time and whether perhap ani slight improv could be seen his mother also want to go in and visit gregor relat soon but his father and sister at first persuad her against it gregor listen veri close to all this and approv fulli later though she had to be held back by forc which made her call out let me go and see gregor he is my unfortun son cant you understand i have to see him and gregor would think to himself that mayb it would be better if his mother came in not everi day of cours but one day a week perhap she could understand everyth much better than his sister who for all her courag was still just a child after all and realli might not have had an adult appreci of the burdensom job she had taken on gregor wish to see his mother was soon realis out of consider for his parent gregor want to avoid be seen at the window dure the day the few squar meter of the floor did not give him much room to crawl about it was hard to just lie quiet through the night his food soon stop give him ani pleasur at all and so to entertain himself he got into the habit of crawl up and down the wall and ceil he was especi fond of hang from the ceil it was quit differ from lie on the floor he could breath more freeli his bodi had a light swing to it and up there relax and almost happi it might happen that he would surpris even himself by let go of the ceil and land on the floor with a crash but now of cours he had far better control of his bodi than befor and even with a fall as great as that caus himself no damag veri soon his sister notic gregor new way of entertain himself he had after all left trace of the adhes from his feet as he crawl about and got it into her head to make it as easi as possibl for him by remov the furnitur that got in his way especi the chest of drawer and the desk now this was not someth that she would be abl to do by herself she did not dare to ask for help from her father the sixteen year old maid had carri on brave sinc the cook had left but she certain would not have help in this she had even ask to be allow to keep the kitchen lock at all time and never to have to open the door unless it was especi import so his sister had no choic but to choos some time when gregor father was not there and fetch his mother to help her as she approach the room gregor could hear his mother express her joy but onc at the door she went silent first of cours his sister came in and look round to see that everyth in the room was alright and onli then did she let her mother enter gregor had hurri pull the sheet down lower over the couch and put more fold into it so that everyth realli look as if it had just been thrown down by chanc gregor also refrain this time from spi out from under the sheet he gave up the chanc to see his mother until later and was simpli glad that she had come you can come in he cant be seen said his sister obvious lead her in by the hand the old chest of drawer was too heavi for a pair of feebl women to be heav about but gregor listen as they push it from it place his sister alway take on the heaviest part of the work for herself and ignor her mother warn that she would strain herself this last a veri long time after labour at it for fifteen minut or more his mother said it would be better to leav the chest where it was for one thing it was too heavi for them to get the job finish befor gregor father got home and leav it in the middl of the room it would be in his way even more and for anoth thing it wasnt even sure that take the furnitur away would realli be ani help to him she thought just the opposit the sight of the bare wall sadden her right to her heart and whi wouldnt gregor feel the same way about it hed been use to this furnitur in his room for a long time and it would make him feel abandon to be in an empti room like that then quiet almost whisper as if want gregor whose whereabout she did not know to hear not even the tone of her voic as she was convinc that he did not understand her word she ad and by take the furnitur away wont it seem like were show that weve given up all hope of improv and were abandon him to cope for himself i think itd be best to leav the room exact the way it was befor so that when gregor come back to us again hell find everyth unchang and hell be abl to forget the time in between all the easier hear these word from his mother made gregor realis that the lack of ani direct human communic along with the monoton life led by the famili dure these two month must have made him confus he could think of no other way of explain to himself whi he had serious want his room empti out had he realli want to transform his room into a cave a warm room fit out with the nice furnitur he had inherit that would have let him crawl around unimped in ani direct but it would also have let him quick forget his past when he had still been human he had come veri close to forget and it had onli been the voic of his mother unheard for so long that had shaken him out of it noth should be remov everyth had to stay he could not do without the good influenc the furnitur had on his condit and if the furnitur made it difficult for him to crawl about mindless that was not a loss but a great advantag his sister unfortun did not agre she had becom use to the idea not without reason that she was gregor spokesman to his parent about the thing that concern him this meant that his mother advic now was suffici reason for her to insist on remov not onli the chest of drawer and the desk as she had thought at first but all the furnitur apart from the all import couch it was more than childish pervers of cours or the unexpect confid she had recent acquir that made her insist she had inde notic that gregor need a lot of room to crawl about in wherea the furnitur as far as anyon could see was of no use to him at all girl of that age though do becom enthusiast about thing and feel they must get their way whenev they can perhap this was what tempt grete to make gregor situat seem even more shock than it was so that she could do even more for him grete would probabl be the onli one who would dare enter a room domin by gregor crawl about the bare wall by himself so she refus to let her mother dissuad her gregor mother alreadi look uneasi in his room she soon stop speak and help gregor sister to get the chest of drawer out with what strength she had the chest of drawer was someth that gregor could do without if he had to but the write desk had to stay hard had the two women push the chest of drawer groan out of the room than gregor poke his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about it he meant to be as care and consider as he could but unfortun it was his mother who came back first while grete in the next room had her arm round the chest push and pull at it from side to side by herself without of cours move it an inch his mother was not use to the sight of gregor he might have made her ill so gregor hurri backward to the far end of the couch in his startlement though he was not abl to prevent the sheet at it front from move a littl it was enough to attract his mother attent she stood veri still remain there a moment and then went back out to grete gregor kept tri to assur himself that noth unusu was happen it was just a few piec of furnitur be move after all but he soon had to admit that the women go to and fro their littl call to each other the scrape of the furnitur on the floor all these thing made him feel as if he were be assail from all side with his head and leg pull in against him and his bodi press to the floor he was forc to admit to himself that he could not stand all of this much longer they were empti his room out take away everyth that was dear to him they had alreadi taken out the chest contain his fretsaw and other tool now they threaten to remov the write desk with it place clear worn into the floor the desk where he had done his homework as a busi traine at high school even while he had been at infant schoolh realli could not wait ani longer to see whether the two women intent were good he had near forgotten they were there anyway as they were now too tire to say anyth while they work and he could onli hear their feet as they step heavili on the floor so while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catch their breath he salli out chang direct four time not know what he should save first befor his attent was sudden caught by the pictur on the wall which was alreadi denud of everyth els that had been on it of the ladi dress in copious fur he hurri up onto the pictur and press himself against it glass it held him firm and felt good on his hot belli this pictur at least now total cover by gregor would certain be taken away by no one he turn his head to face the door into the live room so that he could watch the women when they came back they had not allow themselv a long rest and came back quit soon grete had put her arm around her mother and was near carri her what shall we take now then said grete and look around her eye met those of gregor on the wall perhap onli becaus her mother was there she remain calm bent her face to her so that she would not look round and said albeit hurri and with a tremor in her voic come on let go back in the live room for a while gregor could see what grete had in mind she want to take her mother somewher safe and then chase him down from the wall well she could certain tri it he sat unyield on his pictur he would rather jump at grete face but grete word had made her mother quit worri she step to one side saw the enorm brown patch against the flower of the wallpap and befor she even realis it was gregor that she saw scream oh god oh god arm outstretch she fell onto the couch as if she had given up everyth and stay there immobil gregor shout his sister glower at him and shake her fist that was the first word she had spoken to him direct sinc his transform she ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smell salt to bring her mother out of her faint gregor want to help too he could save his pictur later although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by forc then he too ran into the next room as if he could advis his sister like in the old day but he had to just stand behind her do noth she was look into various bottl he startl her when she turn round a bottl fell to the ground and broke a splinter cut gregor face some kind of caustic medicin splash all over him now without delay ani longer grete took hold of all the bottl she could and ran with them in to her mother she slam the door shut with her foot so now gregor was shut out from his mother who becaus of him might be near to death he could not open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away and she had to stay with his mother there was noth for him to do but wait and oppress with anxieti and self reproach he began to crawl about he crawl over everyth wall furnitur ceil and final in his confus as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down into the middl of the dinner tabl he lay there for a while numb and immobil all around him it was quiet mayb that was a good sign then there was someon at the door the maid of cours had lock herself in her kitchen so that grete would have to go and answer it his father had arriv home what happen were his first word grete appear must have made everyth clear to him she answer him with subdu voic and open press her face into his chest mother faint but shes better now gregor got out just as i expect said his father just as i alway said but you women wouldnt listen would you it was clear to gregor that grete had not said enough and that his father took it to mean that someth bad had happen that he was respons for some act of violenc that meant gregor would now have to tri to calm his father as he did not have the time to explain thing to him even if that had been possibl so he fled to the door of his room and press himself against it so that his father when he came in from the hall could see straight away that gregor had the best intent and would go back into his room without delay that it would not be necessari to drive him back but that they had onli to open the door and he would disappear his father though was not in the mood to notic subtleti like that ah he shout as he came in sound as if he were both angri and glad at the same time gregor drew his head back from the door and lift it toward his father he realli had not imagin his father the way he stood there now of late with his new habit of crawl about he had neglect to pay attent to what was go on the rest of the flat the way he had done befor he realli ought to have expect thing to have chang but still still was that realli his father the same tire man as use to be lay there entomb in his bed when gregor came back from his busi trip who would receiv him sit in the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the even who was hard even abl to stand up but as a sign of his pleasur would just rais his arm and who on the coupl of time a year when they went for a walk togeth on a sunday or public holiday wrap up tight in his overcoat between gregor and his mother would alway labour his way forward a littl more slowli than them who were alreadi walk slowli for his sake who would place his stick down care and if he want to say someth would invari stop and gather his companion around him he was stand up straight enough now dress in a smart blue uniform with gold button the sort worn by the employe at the bank institut abov the high stiff collar of the coat his strong doubl chin emerg under the bushi eyebrow his pierc dark eye look out fresh and alert his normal unkempt white hair was comb down pain close to his scalp he took his cap with it gold monogram from probabl some bank and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa put his hand in his trouser pocket push back the bottom of his long uniform coat and with look of determin walk toward gregor he probabl did not even know himself what he had in mind but nonetheless lift his feet unusu high gregor was amaz at the enorm size of the sole of his boot but wast no time with that he knew full well right from the first day of his new life that his father thought it necessari to alway be extrem strict with him and so he ran up to his father stop when his father stop scurri forward again when he move even slight in this way they went round the room sever time without anyth decis happen without even give the impress of a chase as everyth went so slowli gregor remain all this time on the floor larg becaus he fear his father might see it as especi provok if he fled onto the wall or ceil whatev he did gregor had to admit that he certain would not be abl to keep up this run about for long as for each step his father took he had to carri out countless movement he becam notic short of breath even in his earlier life his lung had not been veri reliabl now as he lurch about in his effort to muster all the strength he could for run he could hard keep his eye open his thought becam too slow for him to think of ani other way of save himself than run he almost forgot that the wall were there for him to use although here they were conceal behind care carv furnitur full of notch and protrus then right besid him light toss someth flew down and roll in front of him it was an appl then anoth one immedi flew at him gregor froze in shock there was no longer ani point in run as his father had decid to bombard him he had fill his pocket with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now without even take the time for care aim threw one appl after anoth these littl red appl roll about on the floor knock into each other as if they had electr motor an appl thrown without much forc glanc against gregor back and slid off without do ani harm anoth one howev immedi follow it hit squar and lodg in his back gregor want to drag himself away as if he could remov the surpris the incred pain by chang his posit but he felt as if nail to the spot and spread himself out all his sens in confus the last thing he saw was the door of his room be pull open his sister was scream his mother ran out in front of her in her blous as his sister had taken off some of her cloth after she had faint to make it easier for her to breath she ran to his father her skirt unfasten and slide one after anoth to the ground stumbl over the skirt she push herself to his father her arm around him unit herself with him total now gregor lost his abil to see anyth her hand behind his father head beg him to spare gregor life iii no one dare to remov the appl lodg in gregor flesh so it remain there as a visibl remind of his injuri he had suffer it there for more than a month and his condit seem serious enough to remind even his father that gregor despit his current sad and revolt form was a famili member who could not be treat as an enemi on the contrari as a famili there was a duti to swallow ani revuls for him and to be patient just to be patient becaus of his injuri gregor had lost much of his mobil probabl perman he had been reduc to the condit of an ancient invalid and it took him long long minut to crawl across his room crawl over the ceil was out of the question but this deterior in his condit was fulli in his opinion made up for by the door to the live room be left open everi even he got into the habit of close watch it for one or two hour befor it was open and then lie in the dark of his room where he could not be seen from the live room he could watch the famili in the light of the dinner tabl and listen to their convers with everyon permiss in a way and thus quit differ from befor they no longer held the live convers of earlier time of cours the one that gregor alway thought about with long when he was tire and get into the damp bed in some small hotel room all of them were usual veri quiet nowaday soon after dinner his father would go to sleep in his chair his mother and sister would urg each other to be quiet his mother bent deepli under the lamp would sew fanci underwear for a fashion shop his sister who had taken a sale job learn shorthand and french in the even so that she might be abl to get a better posit later on sometim his father would wake up and say to gregor mother your do so much sew again today as if he did not know that he had been doze and then he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchang a tire grin with a kind of stubborn gregor father refus to take his uniform off even at home while his nightgown hung unus on it peg gregor father would slumber where he was fulli dress as if alway readi to serv and expect to hear the voic of his superior even here the uniform had not been new to start with but as a result of this it slowli becam even shabbier despit the effort of gregor mother and sister to look after it gregor would often spend the whole even look at all the stain on this coat with it gold button alway kept polish and shini while the old man in it would sleep high uncomfort but peac as soon as it struck ten gregor mother would speak gentl to his father to wake him and tri to persuad him to go to bed as he couldnt sleep proper where he was and he realli had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get to work but sinc he had been in work he had becom more obstin and would alway insist on stay longer at the tabl even though he regular fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuad him to exchang the chair for his bed then howev much mother and sister would importun him with littl reproach and warn he would keep slowli shake his head for a quarter of an hour with his eye close and refus to get up gregor mother would tug at his sleev whisper endear into his ear gregor sister would leav her work to help her mother but noth would have ani effect on him he would just sink deeper into his chair onli when the two women took him under the arm he would abrupt open his eye look at them one after the other and say what a life this is what peac i get in my old age and support by the two women he would lift himself up care as if he were carri the greatest load himself let the women take him to the door send them off and carri on by himself while gregor mother would throw down her needl and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continu be of help to him who in this tire and overwork famili would have had time to give more attent to gregor than was absolut necessari the household budget becam even smaller so now the maid was dismiss an enorm thick bone charwoman with white hair that flap around her head came everi morn and even to do the heaviest work everyth els was look after by gregor mother on top of the larg amount of sew work she did gregor even learn listen to the even convers about what price they had hope for that sever item of jewelleri belong to the famili had been sold even though both mother and sister had been veri fond of wear them at function and celebr but the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumst they could not move out of it there was no imagin way of transfer gregor to the new address he could see quit well though that there were more reason than consider for him that made it difficult for them to move it would have been quit easi to transport him in ani suitabl crate with a few air hole in it the main thing hold the famili back from their decis to move was much more to do with their total despair and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortun unlik anyth experienc by anyon els they knew or were relat to they carri out absolut everyth that the world expect from poor peopl gregor father brought bank employe their breakfast his mother sacrif herself by wash cloth for stranger his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the custom but they just did not have the strength to do ani more and the injuri in gregor back began to hurt as much as when it was new after they had come back from take his father to bed gregor mother and sister would now leav their work where it was and sit close togeth cheek to cheek his mother would point to gregor room and say close that door grete and then when he was in the dark again they would sit in the next room and their tear would mingl or they would simpli sit there stare dri eye at the tabl gregor hard slept at all either night or day sometim he would think of take over the famili affair just like befor the next time the door was open he had long forgotten about his boss and the chief clerk but they would appear again in his thought the salesmen and the apprentic that stupid teaboy two or three friend from other busi one of the chambermaid from a provinci hotel a tender memori that appear and disappear again a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attent had been serious but too slow all of them appear to him mix togeth with stranger and other he had forgotten but instead of help him and his famili they were all of them inaccess and he was glad when they disappear other time he was not at all in the mood to look after his famili he was fill with simpl rage about the lack of attent he was shown and although he could think of noth he would have want he made plan of how he could get into the pantri where he could take all the thing he was entitl to even if he was not hungri gregor sister no longer thought about how she could pleas him but would hurri push some food or other into his room with her foot befor she rush out to work in the morn and at midday and in the even she would sweep it away again with the broom indiffer as to whether it had been eaten or more often than not had been left total untouch she still clear up the room in the even but now she could not have been ani quicker about it smear of dirt were left on the wall here and there were littl ball of dust and filth at first gregor went into one of the worst of these place when his sister arriv as a reproach to her but he could have stay there for week without his sister do anyth about it she could see the dirt as well as he could but she had simpli decid to leav him to it at the same time she becam touchi in a way that was quit new for her and which everyon in the famili understood clean up gregor room was for her and her alon gregor mother did onc thorough clean his room and need to use sever bucket of water to do it although that much damp also made gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch bitter and immobil but his mother was to be punish still more for what she had done as hard had his sister arriv home in the even than she notic the chang in gregor room and high aggriev ran back into the live room where despit her mother rais and implor hand she broke into convuls tear her father of cours was startl out of his chair and the two parent look on astonish and helpless then they too becam agit gregor father stand to the right of his mother accus her of not leav the clean of gregor room to his sister from her left gregor sister scream at her that she was never to clean gregor room again while his mother tri to draw his father who was besid himself with anger into the bedroom his sister quak with tear thump on the tabl with her small fist and gregor hiss in anger that no one had even thought of close the door to save him the sight of this and all it nois gregor sister was exhaust from go out to work and look after gregor as she had done befor was even more work for her but even so his mother ought certain not to have taken her place gregor on the other hand ought not to be neglect now though the charwoman was here this elder widow with a robust bone structur that made her abl to withstand the hardest of thing in her long life wasnt realli repel by gregor just by chanc one day rather than ani real curios she open the door to gregor room and found herself face to face with him he was taken total by surpris no one was chase him but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in amaz with her hand cross in front of her from then on she never fail to open the door slight everi even and morn and look briefli in on him at first she would call to him as she did so with word that she probabl consid friend such as come on then you old dung beetl or look at the old dung beetl there gregor never respond to be spoken to in that way but just remain where he was without move as if the door had never even been open if onli they had told this charwoman to clean up his room everi day instead of let her disturb him for no reason whenev she felt like it one day earli in the morn while a heavi rain struck the windowpan perhap indic that spring was come she began to speak to him in that way onc again gregor was so resent of it that he start to move toward her he was slow and infirm but it was like a kind of attack instead of be afraid the charwoman just lift up one of the chair from near the door and stood there with her mouth open clear intend not to close her mouth until the chair in her hand had been slam down into gregor back arent you come ani closer then she ask when gregor turn round again and she calm put the chair back in the corner gregor had almost entir stop eat onli if he happen to find himself next to the food that had been prepar for him he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it leav it there a few hour and then more often than not spit it out again at first he thought it was distress at the state of his room that stop him eat but he had soon got use to the chang made there they had got into the habit of put thing into this room that they had no room for anywher els and there were now mani such thing as one of the room in the flat had been rent out to three gentlemen these earnest gentlemen all three of them had full beard as gregor learn peer through the crack in the door one day were pain insist on thing be tidi this meant not onli in their own room but sinc they had taken a room in this establish in the entir flat and especi in the kitchen unnecessari clutter was someth they could not toler especi if it was dirti they had moreov brought most of their own furnish and equip with them for this reason mani thing had becom superflu which although they could not be sold the famili did not wish to discard all these thing found their way into gregor room the dustbin from the kitchen found their way in there too the charwoman was alway in a hurri and anyth she couldnt use for the time be she would just chuck in there he fortun would usual see no more than the object and the hand that held it the woman most like meant to fetch the thing back out again when she had time and the opportun or to throw everyth out in one go but what actual happen was that they were left where they land when they had first been thrown unless gregor made his way through the junk and move it somewher els at first he move it becaus with no other room free where he could crawl about he was forc to but later on he came to enjoy it although move about in that way left him sad and tire to death and he would remain immobil for hour afterward the gentlemen who rent the room would sometim take their even meal at home in the live room that was use by everyon and so the door to this room was often kept close in the even but gregor found it easi to give up have the door open he had after all often fail to make use of it when it was open and without the famili have notic it lain in his room in it darkest corner one time though the charwoman left the door to the live room slight open and it remain open when the gentlemen who rent the room came in in the even and the light was put on they sat up at the tabl where former gregor had taken his meal with his father and mother they unfold the serviett and pick up their knive and fork gregor mother immedi appear in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sister with a dish pile high with potato the food was steam and fill the room with it smell the gentlemen bent over the dish set in front of them as if they want to test the food befor eat it and the gentleman in the middl who seem to count as an author for the other two did inde cut off a piec of meat while it was still in it dish clear wish to establish whether it was suffici cook or whether it should be sent back to the kitchen it was to his satisfact and gregor mother and sister who had been look on anxious began to breath again and smile the famili themselv ate in the kitchen nonetheless gregor father came into the live room befor he went into the kitchen bow onc with his cap in his hand and did his round of the tabl the gentlemen stood as one and mumbl someth into their beard then onc they were alon they ate in near perfect silenc it seem remark to gregor that abov all the various nois of eat their chew teeth could still be heard as if they had want to show gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was not possibl to perform anyth with jaw that are toothless howev nice they might be id like to eat someth said gregor anxious but not anyth like theyr eat they do feed themselv and here i am die throughout all this time gregor could not rememb have heard the violin be play but this even it began to be heard from the kitchen the three gentlemen had alreadi finish their meal the one in the middl had produc a newspap given a page to each of the other and now they leant back in their chair read them and smoke when the violin began play they becam attent stood up and went on tip toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood press against each other someon must have heard them in the kitchen as gregor father call out is the play perhap unpleas for the gentlemen we can stop it straight away on the contrari said the middl gentleman would the young ladi not like to come in and play for us here in the room where it is after all much more cosi and comfort oh yes wed love to call back gregor father as if he had been the violin player himself the gentlemen step back into the room and wait gregor father soon appear with the music stand his mother with the music and his sister with the violin she calm prepar everyth for her to begin play his parent who had never rent a room out befor and therefor show an exagger courtesi toward the three gentlemen did not even dare to sit on their own chair his father leant against the door with his right hand push in between two button on his uniform coat his mother though was offer a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat leav the chair where the gentleman happen to have place it out of the way in a corner his sister began to play father and mother paid close attent one on each side to the movement of her hand drawn in by the play gregor had dare to come forward a littl and alreadi had his head in the live room befor he had taken great pride in how consider he was but now it hard occur to him that he had becom so thoughtless about the other what more there was now all the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was cover in the dust that lay everywher in his room and flew up at the slightest movement he carri thread hair and remain of food about on his back and side he was much too indiffer to everyth now to lay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had use to do sever time a day and despit this condit he was not too shi to move forward a littl onto the immacul floor of the live room no one notic him though the famili was total preoccupi with the violin play at first the three gentlemen had put their hand in their pocket and come up far too close behind the music stand to look at all the note be play and they must have disturb gregor sister but soon in contrast with the famili they withdrew back to the window with their head sunk and talk to each other at half volum and they stay by the window while gregor father observ them anxious it realli now seem veri obvious that they had expect to hear some beauti or entertain violin play but had been disappoint that they had had enough of the whole perform and it was onli now out of polit that they allow their peac to be disturb it was especi unnerv the way they all blew the smoke from their cigarett upward from their mouth and nose yet gregor sister was play so beauti her face was leant to one side follow the line of music with a care and melancholi express gregor crawl a littl further forward keep his head close to the ground so that he could meet her eye if the chanc came was he an anim if music could captiv him so it seem to him that he was be shown the way to the unknown nourish he had been yearn for he was determin to make his way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her violin as no one appreci her play here as much as he would he never want to let her out of his room not while he live anyway his shock appear should for onc be of some use to him he want to be at everi door of his room at onc to hiss and spit at the attack his sister should not be forc to stay with him though but stay of her own free will she would sit besid him on the couch with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had alway intend to send her to the conservatori how he would have told everyon about it last christma had christma realli come and gone alreadi if this misfortun hadnt got in the way and refus to let anyon dissuad him from it on hear all this his sister would break out in tear of emot and gregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her neck which sinc she had been go out to work she had kept free without ani necklac or collar mr samsa shout the middl gentleman to gregor father point without wast ani more word with his forefing at gregor as he slowli move forward the violin went silent the middl of the three gentlemen first smile at his two friend shake his head and then look back at gregor his father seem to think it more import to calm the three gentlemen befor drive gregor out even though they were not at all upset and seem to think gregor was more entertain than the violin play had been he rush up to them with his arm spread out and attempt to drive them back into their room at the same time as tri to block their view of gregor with his bodi now they did becom a littl annoy and it was not clear whether it was his father behaviour that annoy them or the dawn realis that they had had a neighbour like gregor in the next room without know it they ask gregor father for explan rais their arm like he had tug excit at their beard and move back toward their room onli veri slowli meanwhil gregor sister had overcom the despair she had fallen into when her play was sudden interrupt she had let her hand drop and let violin and bow hang limpli for a while but continu to look at the music as if still play but then she sudden pull herself togeth lay the instrument on her mother lap who still sat labori struggl for breath where she was and ran into the next room which under pressur from her father the three gentlemen were more quick move toward under his sister experienc hand the pillow and cover on the bed flew up and were put into order and she had alreadi finish make the bed and slip out again befor the three gentlemen had reach the room gregor father seem so obsess with what he was do that he forgot all the respect he owe to his tenant he urg them and press them until when he was alreadi at the door of the room the middl of the three gentlemen shout like thunder and stamp his foot and therebi brought gregor father to a halt i declar here and now he said rais his hand and glanc at gregor mother and sister to gain their attent too that with regard to the repugn condit that prevail in this flat and with this famili here he look briefli but decis at the floor i give immedi notic on my room for the day that i have been live here i will of cours pay noth at all on the contrari i will consid whether

his two friend join in with the word and we also give immedi notic with that he took hold of the door handl and slam the door gregor father stagger back to his seat feel his way with his hand and fell into it it look as if he was stretch himself out for his usual even nap but from the uncontrol way his head kept nod it could be seen that he was not sleep at all throughout all this gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen him his disappoint at the failur of his plan and perhap also becaus he was weak from hunger made it imposs for him to move he was sure that everyon would turn on him ani moment and he wait he was not even startl out of this state when the violin on his mother lap fell from her trembl finger and land loud on the floor father mother said his sister hit

had no intent of frighten anyon least of all his sister all he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room although that was in itself quit startl as his pain wrack condit meant that turn round requir a great deal of effort and he was use his head to help himself do it repeat rais it and strike it against the floor he stop and look round they seem to have realis his

there was not a word not ani cri from his famili to distract him he did not turn his head until he had reach the doorway he did not turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becom stiff but it was nonetheless enough to see that noth behind him had chang onli his sister had stood up with his last glanc he saw that his mother had now fallen complet asleep he was hard insid his room befor the door was hurri shut bolt and lock the sudden nois behind gregor so startl him that his littl leg collaps under him it was his sister who had been in so much of a rush she had been stand there wait and sprung forward light gregor had not heard her come at all and as she turn the key in the lock she said loud to her parent at last what now then gregor ask himself as he look round in the dark he soon made the discoveri that he could no longer move at all this was no surpris to him it seem rather that be abl to actual move around on those spind littl leg until then was unnatur he also felt relat comfort it is true that his entir bodi was ach but the pain seem to be slowli get weaker and weaker and would final disappear altogeth he could alreadi hard feel the decay appl in his back or the

soon realis what had realli happen open her eye wide whistl to herself but did not wast time to yank open the bedroom door and shout loud into the dark of the bedroom come and ave a look at this it dead just lie there stone dead mr and mrs samsa sat upright there in their marriag bed and had to make an effort to get over the shock caus by the cleaner befor they could grasp what she was say but then each from his own side they hurri out of bed mr samsa threw the blanket over his shoulder mrs samsa just came out in her nightdress and that is how they went into gregor room on the way they open the door to the live room where grete had been sleep sinc the three gentlemen had move in she was fulli dress as if she had never been asleep and the pale of her face seem to confirm this dead ask mrs

although it was still earli in the morn the fresh air had someth of warmth mix in with it it was alreadi the end of march after all the three gentlemen step out of their room and look round in amaz for their breakfast they had been forgotten about where is our breakfast the middl gentleman ask the cleaner irrit she just put her finger on her lip and made a quick and silent sign to the men that they might like to come into gregor room they did so and stood around gregor corps with their hand in the pocket of their well worn coat it was now quit light in the room then the door of the bedroom open and mr samsa appear in his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other all of them had been cri a littl grete now and then press her face against her father arm leav my home now said mr samsa indic the door and without let the women from him what do you mean ask the middl of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcert and he smile sweet the other two held their hand behind their back and continu rub them togeth in gleeful anticip of a loud quarrel which could onli end in their favour i mean just what i said answer mr samsa and with his two companion went in a straight line toward the man at first he stood there still look at the ground as if the content of his head were rearrang themselv into new posit alright well go then he said and look up at mr samsa as if he had been sudden overcom with humil and want permiss again from mr samsa for his decis mr samsa mere open his eye wide and briefli nod to him sever time at that and without delay the man actual did take long stride into the front hallway his two friend had stop rub their hand some time befor and had been listen to what was be said now they jump off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that mr samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the connect with their leader onc there all three took their hat from the stand took their stick from the holder bow without a word and left the premis mr samsa and the two women follow them out onto the land but they had had no reason to mistrust the men intent and as they lean over the land they saw how the three gentlemen made slow but steadi progress down the mani step as they turn the corner on each floor they disappear and would reappear a few moment later the further down they went the more that the samsa famili
