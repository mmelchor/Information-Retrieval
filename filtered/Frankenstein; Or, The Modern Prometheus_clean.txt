assist the develop of filial love my temper was sometim violent and my passion vehement but by some law in my temperatur they were turn not toward childish pursuit but to an eager desir to learn and not to learn all thing indiscrimin i confess that neither the structur of languag nor the code of govern nor the polit of various state possess attract for me it was the secret of heaven and earth that i desir to learn and whether it was the outward substanc of thing or the inner spirit of natur and the mysteri soul of man that occupi me still my inquiri were direct to the metaphys or in it highest sens the physic secret of the world meanwhil clerval occupi himself so to speak with the moral relat of thing the busi stage of life the virtu of hero and the action of men were his theme and his hope and his dream was to becom one among those whose name are record in stori as the gallant and adventur benefactor of our speci the saint soul of elizabeth shone like a shrine dedic lamp in our

reflect upon self besid in draw the pictur of my earli day i also record those event which led by insens step to my after tale of miseri for when i would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterward rule my destini i find it aris like a mountain river from ignobl and almost forgotten sourc but swell as it proceed it becam the torrent which in it cours has swept away all my hope and joy natur philosophi is the genius that has regul my fate i desir therefor in this narrat to state those fact which led to my predilect for that scienc when i was thirteen year of age we all went on a parti of pleasur to the bath near thonon the inclem of the weather oblig us to remain a day confin to the inn in this hous i chanc to find a volum of the work of cornelius agrippa i open it with apathi the theori which he attempt to demonstr and the wonder fact which he relat soon chang this feel into enthusiasm a new light seem to dawn upon my mind and bound with joy i communic my discoveri to my father my father look careless at the titl page of my book and said ah cornelius agrippa my dear victor do not wast your time upon this it is sad trash if instead of this remark my father had taken the pain to explain to me that the principl of agrippa had been entir explod and that a modern system of scienc had been introduc which possess much greater power than the ancient becaus the power of the latter were chimer while those of the former were real and practic under such circumst i should certain have thrown agrippa asid and have content my imagin warm as it was by return with greater ardour to my former studi it is even possibl that the train of my idea would never have receiv the fatal impuls that led to my ruin but the cursori glanc my father had taken of my volum by no mean assur me that he was acquaint with it content and i continu to read with the greatest avid when i return home my first care was to procur the whole work of this author and afterward of paracelsus and albertus magnus i read and studi the wild fanci of these writer with delight they appear to me treasur known to few besid myself i have describ myself as alway have been imbu with a fervent long to penetr the secret of natur in spite of the intens labour and wonder discoveri of modern philosoph i alway came from my studi discont and unsatisfi sir isaac newton is said to have avow that he felt like a child pick up shell besid the great and unexplor ocean of truth those of his successor in each branch of natur philosophi with whom i was acquaint appear even to my boy apprehens as tyro engag in the same pursuit the untaught peasant beheld the element around him and was acquaint with their practic use the most learn philosoph knew littl more he had partial unveil the face of natur but her immort lineament were still a wonder and a mysteri he might dissect anatom and give name but not to speak of a final caus caus in their secondari and tertiari grade were utter unknown to him i had gaze upon the fortif and impedi that seem to keep human be from enter the citadel of natur and rash and ignor i had repin but here were book and here were men who had penetr deeper and knew more i took their word for all that they aver and i becam their discipl it may appear strang that such should aris in the eighteenth centuri but while i follow the routin of educ in the school of geneva i was to a great degre self taught with regard to my favourit studi my father was not scientif and i was left to struggl with a child blind ad to a student thirst for knowledg under the guidanc of my new preceptor i enter with the greatest dilig into the search of the philosoph stone and the elixir of life but the latter soon obtain my undivid attent wealth was an inferior object but what glori would attend the discoveri if i could banish diseas from the human frame and render man invulner to ani but a violent death nor were these my onli vision the rais of ghost or devil was a promis liber accord by my favourit author the fulfil of which i most eager sought and if my incant were alway unsuccess i attribut the failur rather to my own inexperi and mistak than to a want of skill or fidel in my instructor and thus for a time i was occupi by explod system mingl like an unadept a thousand contradictori theori and flounder desper in a veri slough of multifari knowledg guid by an ardent imagin and childish reason till an accid again chang the current of my idea when i was about fifteen year old we had retir to our hous near belriv when we wit a most violent and terribl thunderstorm it advanc from behind the mountain of jura and the thunder burst at onc with fright loud from various quarter of the heaven i remain while the storm last watch it progress with curios and delight as i stood at the door on a sudden i beheld a stream of fire issu from an old and beauti oak which stood about twenti yard from our hous and so soon as the dazzl light vanish the oak had disappear and noth remain but a blast stump when we visit it the next morn we found the tree shatter in a singular manner it was not splinter by the shock but entir reduc to thin ribbon of wood i never beheld anyth so utter destroy befor this i was not unacquaint with the more obvious law of electr on this occas a man of great research in natur philosophi was with us and excit by this catastroph he enter on the explan of a theori which he had form on the subject of electr and galvan which was at onc new and astonish to me all that he said threw great into the shade cornelius agrippa albertus magnus and paracelsus the lord of my imagin but by some fatal the overthrow of these men disinclin me to pursu my accustom studi it seem to me as if noth would or could ever be known all that had so long engag my attent sudden grew despic by one of those capric of the mind which we are perhap most subject to in earli youth i at onc gave up my former occup set down natur histori and all it progeni as a deform and abort creation and entertain the greatest disdain for a would be scienc which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledg in this mood of mind i betook myself to the mathemat and the branch of studi appertain to that scienc as be built upon secur foundat and so worthi of my consider thus strang are our soul construct and by such slight ligament are we bound to prosper or ruin when i look back it seem to me as if this almost miracul chang of inclin and will was the immedi suggest of the guardian angel of my lifeth last effort made by the spirit of preserv to avert the storm that was even then hang in the star and readi to envelop me her victori was announc by an unusu tranquil and glad of soul which follow the relinquish of my ancient and latter torment studi it was thus that i was to be taught to associ evil with their prosecut happi with their disregard it was a strong effort of the spirit of good but it was ineffectu destini was too potent and her immut law had decre my utter and terribl destruct chapter 3 when i had attain the age of seventeen my parent resolv that i should becom a student at the univers of ingolstadt i had hitherto attend the school of geneva but my father thought it necessari for the complet of my educ that i should be made acquaint with other custom than those of my nativ countri my departur was therefor fix at an earli date but befor the day resolv upon could arriv the first misfortun of my life occurredan omen as it were of my futur miseri elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever her ill was sever and she was in the greatest danger dure her ill mani argument had been urg to persuad my mother to refrain from attend upon her she had at first yield to our entreati but when she heard that the life of her favourit was menac she could no longer control her anxieti she attend her sickb her watch attent triumph over the malign of the distemperelizabeth was save but the consequ of this imprud were fatal to her preserv on the third day my mother sicken her fever was accompani by the most alarm symptom and the look of her medic attend prognost the worst event on her deathb the fortitud and benign of this best of women did not desert her she join the hand of elizabeth and myself my children she said my firmest hope of futur happi were place on the prospect of your union this expect will now be the consol of your father elizabeth my love you must suppli my place to my younger children ala i regret that i am taken from you and happi and belov as i have been is it not hard to quit you all but these are not thought befit me i will endeavour to resign myself cheer to death and will indulg a hope of meet you in anoth world she die calm and her counten express affect even in death i need not describ the feel of those whose dearest tie are rent by that most irrepar evil the void that present itself to the soul and the despair that is exhibit on the counten it is so long befor the mind can persuad itself that she whom we saw everi day and whose veri exist appear a part of our own can have depart foreverthat the bright of a belov eye can have been extinguish and the sound of a voic so familiar and dear to the ear can be hush never more to be heard these are the reflect of the first day but when the laps of time prove the realiti of the evil then the actual bitter of grief commenc yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connect and whi should i describ a sorrow which all have felt and must feel the time at length arriv when grief is rather an indulg than a necess and the smile that play upon the lip although it may be deem a sacrileg is not banish my mother was dead but we had still duti which we ought to perform we must continu our cours with the rest and learn to think ourselv fortun whilst one remain whom the spoiler has not seiz my departur for ingolstadt which had been defer by these event was now again determin upon i obtain from my father a respit of some week it appear to me sacrileg so soon to leav the repos akin to death of the hous of mourn and to rush into the thick of life i was new to sorrow but it did not the less alarm me i was unwil to quit the sight of those that remain to me and abov all i desir to see my sweet elizabeth in some degre consol she inde veil her grief and strove to act the comfort to us all she look steadili on life and assum it duti with courag and zeal she devot herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncl and cousin never was she so enchant as at this time when she recal the sunshin of her smile and spent them upon us she forgot even her own regret in her endeavour to make us forget the day of my departur at length arriv clerval spent the last even with us he had endeavour to persuad his father to permit him to accompani me and to becom my fellow student but in vain his father was a narrow mind trader and saw idl and ruin in the aspir and ambit of his son henri deepli felt the misfortun of be debar from a liber educ he said littl but when he spoke i read in his kindl eye and in his anim glanc a restrain but firm resolv not to be chain to the miser detail of commerc we sat late we could not tear ourselv away from each other nor persuad ourselv to say the word farewel it was said and we retir under the pretenc of seek repos each fanci that the other was deceiv but when at morn dawn i descend to the carriag which was to convey me away they were all theremi father again to bless me clerval to press my hand onc more my elizabeth to renew her entreati that i would write often and to bestow the last feminin attent on her playmat and friend i threw myself into the chais that was to convey me away and indulg in the most melancholi reflect i who had ever been surround by amiabl companion continu engag in endeavour to bestow mutual pleasurei was now alon in the univers whither i was go i must form my own friend and be my own protector my life had hitherto been remark seclud and domest and this had given me invinc repugn to new counten i love my brother elizabeth and clerval these were old familiar face but i believ myself total unfit for the compani of stranger such were my reflect as i commenc my journey but as i proceed my spirit and hope rose i ardent desir the acquisit of knowledg i had often when at home thought it hard to remain dure my youth coop up in one place and had long to enter the world and take my station among other human be now my desir were compli with and it would inde have been folli to repent i had suffici leisur for these and mani other reflect dure my journey to ingolstadt which was long and fatigu at length the high white steepl of the town met my eye i alight and was conduct to my solitari apart to spend the even as i pleas the next morn i deliv my letter of introduct and paid a visit to some of the princip professor chanceor rather the evil influenc the angel of destruct which assert omnipot sway over me from the moment i turn my reluct step from my father doorl me first to m kremp professor of natur philosophi he was an uncouth man but deepli imbu in the secret of his scienc he ask me sever question concern my progress in the differ branch of scienc appertain to natur philosophi i repli careless and part in contempt mention the name of my alchemist as the princip author i had studi the professor stare have you he said realli spent your time in studi such nonsens i repli in the affirm everi minut continu m kremp with warmth everi instant that you have wast on those book is utter and entir lost you have burden your memori with explod system and useless name good god in what desert land have you live where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fanci which you have so greedili imbib are a thousand year old and as musti as they are ancient i littl expect in this enlighten and scientif age to find a discipl of albertus magnus and paracelsus my dear sir you must begin your studi entir anew so say he step asid and wrote down a list of sever book treat of natur philosophi which he desir me to procur and dismiss me after mention that in the begin of the follow week he intend to commenc a cours of lectur upon natur philosophi in it general relat and that m waldman a fellow professor would lectur upon chemistri the altern day that he omit i return home not disappoint for i have said that i had long consid those author useless whom the professor reprob but i return not at all the more inclin to recur to these studi in ani shape m kremp was a littl squat man with a gruff voic and a repuls counten the teacher therefor did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuit in rather a too philosoph and connect a strain perhap i have given an account of the conclus i had come to concern them in my earli year as a child i had not been content with the result promis by the modern professor of natur scienc with a confus of idea onli to be account for by my extrem youth and my want of a guid on such matter i had retrod the step of knowledg along the path of time and exchang the discoveri of recent inquir for the dream of forgotten alchemist besid i had a contempt for the use of modern natur philosophi it was veri differ when the master of the scienc sought immort and power such view although futil were grand but now the scene was chang the ambit of the inquir seem to limit itself to the annihil of those vision on which my interest in scienc was chiefli found i was requir to exchang chimera of boundless grandeur for realiti of littl worth such were my reflect dure the first two or three day of my resid at ingolstadt which were chiefli spent in becom acquaint with the local and the princip resid in my new abod but as the ensu week commenc i thought of the inform which m kremp had given me concern the lectur and although i could not consent to go and hear that littl conceit fellow deliv sentenc out of a pulpit i recollect what he had said of m waldman whom i had never seen as he had hitherto been out of town part from curios and part from idl i went into the lectur room which m waldman enter short after this professor was veri unlik his colleagu he appear about fifti year of age but with an aspect express of the greatest benevol a few grey hair cover his templ but those at the back of his head were near black his person was short but remark erect and his voic the sweetest i had ever heard he began his lectur by a recapitul of the histori of chemistri and the various improv made by differ men of learn pronounc with fervour the name of the most distinguish discover he then took a cursori view of the present state of the scienc and explain mani of it elementari term after have made a few preparatori experi he conclud with a panegyr upon modern chemistri the term of which i shall never forget the ancient teacher of this scienc said he promis imposs and perform noth the modern master promis veri littl they know that metal cannot be transmut and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosoph whose hand seem onli made to dabbl in dirt and their eye to pore over the microscop or crucibl have inde perform miracl they penetr into the recess of natur and show how she work in her hide place they ascend into the heaven they have discov how the blood circul and the natur of the air we breath they have acquir new and almost unlimit power they can command the thunder of heaven mimic the earthquak and even mock the invis world with it own shadow such were the professor wordsrath let me say such the word of the fateenounc to destroy me as he went on i felt as if my soul were grappl with a palpabl enemi one by one the various key were touch which form the mechan of my be chord after chord was sound and soon my mind was fill with one thought one concept one purpos so much has been done exclaim the soul of frankensteinmor far more will i achiev tread in the step alreadi mark i will pioneer a new way explor unknown power and unfold to the world the deepest mysteri of creation i close not my eye that night my intern be was in a state of insurrect and turmoil i felt that order would thenc aris but i had no power to produc it by degre after the morn dawn sleep came i awok and my yesternight thought were as a dream there onli remain a resolut to return to my ancient studi and to devot myself to a scienc for which i believ myself to possess a natur talent on the same day i paid m waldman a visit his manner in privat were even more mild and attract than in public for there was a certain digniti in his mien dure his lectur which in his own hous was replac by the greatest affabl and kind i gave him pretti near the same account of my former pursuit as i had given to his fellow professor he heard with attent the littl narrat concern my studi and smile at the name of cornelius agrippa and paracelsus but without the contempt that m kremp had exhibit he said that these were men to whose indefatig zeal modern philosoph were indebt for most of the foundat of their knowledg they had left to us as an easier task to give new name and arrang in connect classif the fact which they in a great degre had been the instrument of bring to light the labour of men of genius howev erron direct scarc ever fail in ultim turn to the solid advantag of mankind i listen to his statement which was deliv without ani presumpt or affect and then ad that his lectur had remov my prejudic against modern chemist i express myself in measur term with the modesti and defer due from a youth to his instructor without let escap inexperi in life would have made me asham ani of the enthusiasm which stimul my intend labour i request his advic concern the book i ought to procur i am happi said m waldman to have gain a discipl and if your applic equal your abil i have no doubt of your success chemistri is that branch of natur philosophi in which the greatest improv have been and may be made it is on that account that i have made it my peculiar studi but at the same time i have not neglect the other branch of scienc a man would make but a veri sorri chemist if he attend to that depart of human knowledg alon if your wish is to becom realli a man of scienc and not mere a petti experimentalist i should advis you to appli to everi branch of natur philosophi includ mathemat he then took me into his laboratori and explain to me the use of his various machin instruct me as to what i ought to procur and promis me the use of his own when i should have advanc far enough in the scienc not to derang their mechan he also gave me the list of book which i had request and i took my leav thus end a day memor to me it decid my futur destini chapter 4 from this day natur philosophi and particular chemistri in the most comprehens sens of the term becam near my sole occup i read with ardour those work so full of genius and discrimin which modern inquir have written on these subject i attend the lectur and cultiv the acquaint of the men of scienc of the univers and i found even in m kremp a great deal of sound sens and real inform combin it is true with a repuls physiognomi and manner but not on that account the less valuabl in m waldman i found a true friend his gentl was never ting by dogmat and his instruct were given with an air of frank and good natur that banish everi idea of pedantri in a thousand way he smooth for me the path of knowledg and made the most abstrus inquiri clear and facil to my apprehens my applic was at first fluctuat and uncertain it gain strength as i proceed and soon becam so ardent and eager that the star often disappear in the light of morn whilst i was yet engag in my laboratori as i appli so close it may be easili conceiv that my progress was rapid my ardour was inde the astonish of the student and my profici that of the master professor kremp often ask me with a sli smile how cornelius agrippa went on whilst m waldman express the most heartfelt exult in my progress two year pass in this manner dure which i paid no visit to geneva but was engag heart and soul in the pursuit of some discoveri which i hope to make none but those who have experienc them can conceiv of the entic of scienc in other studi you go as far as other have gone befor you and there is noth more to know but in a scientif pursuit there is continu food for discoveri and wonder a mind of moder capac which close pursu one studi must infal arriv at great profici in that studi and i who continu sought the attain of one object of pursuit and was sole wrap up in this improv so rapid that at the end of two year i made some discoveri in the improv of some chemic instrument which procur me great esteem and admir at the univers when i had arriv at this point and had becom as well acquaint with the theori and practic of natur philosophi as depend on the lesson of ani of the professor at ingolstadt my resid there be no longer conduc to my improv i thought of return to my friend and my nativ town when an incid happen that protract my stay one of the phenomena which had peculiar attract my attent was the structur of the human frame and inde ani anim endu with life whenc i often ask myself did the principl of life proceed it was a bold question and one which has ever been consid as a mysteri yet with how mani thing are we upon the brink of becom acquaint if cowardic or careless did not restrain our inquiri i revolv these circumst in my mind and determin thenceforth to appli myself more particular to those branch of natur philosophi which relat to physiolog unless i had been anim by an almost supernatur enthusiasm my applic to this studi would have been irksom and almost intoler to examin the caus of life we must first have recours to death i becam acquaint with the scienc of anatomi but this was not suffici i must also observ the natur decay and corrupt of the human bodi in my educ my father had taken the greatest precaut that my mind should be impress with no supernatur horror i do not ever rememb to have trembl at a tale of superstit or to have fear the apparit of a spirit dark had no effect upon my fanci and a churchyard was to me mere the receptacl of bodi depriv of life which from be the seat of beauti and strength had becom food for the worm now i was led to examin the caus and progress of this decay and forc to spend day and night in vault and charnel hous my attent was fix upon everi object the most insupport to the delicaci of the human feel i saw how the fine form of man was degrad and wast i beheld the corrupt of death succeed to the bloom cheek of life i saw how the worm inherit the wonder of the eye and brain i paus examin and analys all the minutia of causat as exemplifi in the chang from life to death and death to life until from the midst of this dark a sudden light broke in upon mea light so brilliant and wondrous yet so simpl that while i becam dizzi with the immens of the prospect which it illustr i was surpris that among so mani men of genius who had direct their inquiri toward the same scienc that i alon should be reserv to discov so astonish a secret rememb i am not record the vision of a madman the sun doe not more certain shine in the heaven than that which i now affirm is true some miracl might have produc it yet the stage of the discoveri were distinct and probabl after day and night of incred labour and fatigu i succeed in discov the caus of generat and life nay more i becam myself capabl of bestow anim upon lifeless matter the astonish which i had at first experienc on this discoveri soon gave place to delight and raptur after so much time spent in pain labour to arriv at onc at the summit of my desir was the most gratifi consumm of my toil but this discoveri was so great and overwhelm that all the step by which i had been progress led to it were obliter and i beheld onli the result what had been the studi and desir of the wisest men sinc the creation of the world was now within my grasp not that like a magic scene it all open upon me at onc the inform i had obtain was of a natur rather to direct my endeavour so soon as i should point them toward the object of my search than to exhibit that object alreadi accomplish i was like the arabian who had been buri with the dead and found a passag to life aid onli by one glimmer and seem ineffectu light i see by your eager and the wonder and hope which your eye express my friend that you expect to be inform of the secret with which i am acquaint that cannot be listen patient until the end of my stori and you will easili perceiv whi i am reserv upon that subject i will not lead you on unguard and ardent as i then was to your destruct and infal miseri learn from me if not by my precept at least by my exampl how danger is the acquir of knowledg and how much happier that man is who believ his nativ town to be the world than he who aspir to becom greater than his natur will allow when i found so astonish a power place within my hand i hesit a long time concern the manner in which i should employ it although i possess the capac of bestow anim yet to prepar a frame for the recept of it with all it intricaci of fibr muscl and vein still remain a work of inconceiv difficulti and labour i doubt at first whether i should attempt the creation of a be like myself or one of simpler organ but my imagin was too much exalt by my first success to permit me to doubt of my abil to give life to an anim as complex and wonder as man the materi at present within my command hard appear adequ to so arduous an undertak but i doubt not that i should ultim succeed i prepar myself for a multitud of revers my oper might be incess baffl and at last my work be imperfect yet when i consid the improv which everi day take place in scienc and mechan i was encourag to hope my present attempt would at least lay the foundat of futur success nor could i consid the magnitud and complex of my plan as ani argument of it impractic it was with these feel that i began the creation of a human be as the minut of the part form a great hindranc to my speed i resolv contrari to my first intent to make the be of a gigant statur that is to say about eight feet in height and proportion larg after have form this determin and have spent some month in success collect and arrang my materi i began no one can conceiv the varieti of feel which bore me onward like a hurrican in the first enthusiasm of success life and death appear to me ideal bound which i should first break through and pour a torrent of light into our dark world a new speci would bless me as it creator and sourc mani happi and excel natur would owe their be to me no father could claim the gratitud of his child so complet as i should deserv their pursu these reflect i thought that if i could bestow anim upon lifeless matter i might in process of time although i now found it imposs renew life where death had appar devot the bodi to corrupt these thought support my spirit while i pursu my undertak with unremit ardour my cheek had grown pale with studi and my person had becom emaci with confin sometim on the veri brink of certainti i fail yet still i clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realiz one secret which i alon possess was the hope to which i had dedic myself and the moon gaze on my midnight labour while with unrelax and breathless eager i pursu natur to her hide place who shall conceiv the horror of my secret toil as i dabbl among the unhallow damp of the grave or tortur the live anim to anim the lifeless clay my limb now trembl and my eye swim with the remembr but then a resistless and almost frantic impuls urg me forward i seem to have lost all soul or sensat but for this one pursuit it was inde but a pass tranc that onli made me feel with renew acut so soon as the unnatur stimulus ceas to oper i had return to my old habit i collect bone from charnel hous and disturb with profan finger the tremend secret of the human frame in a solitari chamber or rather cell at the top of the hous and separ from all the other apart by a galleri and staircas i kept my workshop of filthi creation my eyebal were start from their socket in attend to the detail of my employ the dissect room and the slaughter hous furnish mani of my materi and often did my human natur turn with loath from my occup whilst still urg on by an

convinc that he was justifi in conceiv that i should not be altogeth free from blame a human be in perfect ought alway to preserv a calm and peac mind and never to allow passion or a transitori desir to disturb his tranquil i do not think that the pursuit of knowledg is an except to this rule if the studi to which you appli yourself has a tendenc to weaken your affect and to destroy your tast for those simpl pleasur in which no alloy can possibl mix then that studi is certain unlaw that is to say not befit the human mind if this rule were alway observ if no man allow ani pursuit whatsoev to

combin against her which might have stagger anyon who had not such proof of her innoc as i had she had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been commit and toward morn had been perceiv by a market woman not far from the spot where the bodi of the murder child had been afterward found the woman ask her what she did there but she look veri strang and onli return a confus and unintellig answer she return to the hous about eight oclock and when one inquir where she had pass the night she repli that she had been look for the child and demand earnest if anyth had been heard concern him when shown the bodi she fell into violent hyster and kept her bed for sever day the pictur was then produc which the servant had found in her pocket and when elizabeth in a falter voic

question by the market woman was not surpris sinc she had pass a sleepless night and the fate of poor william was yet uncertain concern the pictur she could give no account i know continu the unhappi victim how heavili and fatal this one circumst weigh against me but i have no power of explain it and when i have express my utter ignor i am onli left to conjectur concern the probabl by which it might have been place in my pocket but here also i am check i believ that i have no enemi on earth and none sure would have been so wick as to destroy me wanton did the murder place it there i know of no opportun afford him for so do or if i had whi should he have stolen the jewel to part with it again so soon i commit my caus to the justic of my judg yet i see no room for hope i beg permiss to have a few wit examin concern my charact and if their testimoni shall not overweigh my suppos guilt i must be condemn although i would pledg my salvat on my innoc sever wit were call who had known her for mani year and they spoke well of her but fear and hatr of the crime of which they suppos her guilti render them timor and unwil to come forward elizabeth saw even this last resourc her excel disposit and irreproach conduct about to fail the accus when although violent agit she desir permiss to address the court i am said she the cousin of the unhappi child who was murder or rather his sister for i was educ by and have live with his parent ever sinc and even long befor his birth it may therefor be judg indec in me to come forward on this occas but when i see a fellow creatur about to perish through the cowardic of her pretend friend i wish to be allow to speak that i may say what i know of her charact i am well acquaint with the accus i have live in the same hous with her at one time for five and at anoth for near two year dure all that period she appear to me the most amiabl and benevol of human creatur she nurs madam frankenstein my aunt in her last ill with the greatest affect and care and afterward attend her own mother dure a tedious ill in a manner that excit the admir of all who knew her after which she again live in my uncl hous where she was belov by all the famili she was warm attach to the child who is now dead and act toward him like a most affection mother for my own part i do not hesit to say that notwithstand all the evid produc against her i believ and reli on her perfect innoc she had no temptat for such an action as to the baubl on which the chief proof rest if she had earnest desir it i should have will given it to her so much do i esteem and valu her a murmur of approb follow elizabeth simpl and power appeal but it was excit by her generous interfer and not in favour of poor justin on whom the public indign was turn with renew violenc charg her with the blackest ingratitud she herself wept as elizabeth spoke but she did not answer my own agit and anguish was extrem dure the whole trial i believ in her innoc i knew it could the demon who had i did not for a minut doubt murder my brother also in his hellish sport have betray the innoc to death and ignomini i could not sustain the horror of my situat and when i perceiv that the popular voic and the counten of the judg had alreadi condemn my unhappi victim i rush out of the court in agoni the tortur of the accus did not equal mine she was sustain by innoc but the fang of remors tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold i pass a night of unmingl wretched in the morn i went to the court my lip and throat were parch i dare not ask the fatal question but i was known and the offic guess the caus of my visit the ballot had been thrown they were all black and justin was condemn i cannot pretend to describ what i then felt i had befor experienc sensat of horror and i have endeavour to bestow upon them adequ express but word cannot convey an idea of the heart sicken despair that i then endur the person to whom i address myself ad that justin had alreadi confess her guilt that evid he observ was hard requir in so glare a case but i am glad of it and inde none of our judg like to condemn a crimin upon circumstanti evid be it ever so decis this was strang and unexpect intellig what could it mean had my eye deceiv me and was i realli as mad as the whole world would believ me to be if i disclos the object of my suspicion i hasten to return home and elizabeth eager demand the result my cousin repli i it is decid as you may have expect all judg had rather that ten innoc should suffer than that one guilti should escap but she has confess this was a dire blow to poor elizabeth who had reli with firm upon justin innoc ala said she how shall i ever again believ in human good justin whom i love and esteem as my sister how could she put on those smile of innoc onli to betray her mild eye seem incap of ani sever or guil and yet she has commit a murder soon after we heard that the poor victim had express a desir to see my cousin my father wish her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feel to decid yes said elizabeth i will go although she is guilti and you victor shall accompani me i cannot go alon the idea of

art chapter 9 noth is more pain to the human mind than after the feel have been work up by a quick success of event the dead calm of inact and certainti which follow and depriv the soul both of hope and fear justin die she rest and i was aliv the blood flow freeli in my vein but a weight of despair and remors press on my heart which noth could remov sleep fled from my eye i wander like an evil spirit for i had commit deed of mischief beyond descript horribl and more much more i persuad myself was yet behind yet my heart overflow with kind and the love of virtu i had begun life with benevol intent and thirst for the moment when i should put them in practic and make myself use to my fellow be now all was blast instead of that seren of conscienc which allow me to look back upon the past with self satisfact and from thenc to gather promis of new hope i was seiz by remors and the sens of guilt which hurri me away to a hell of intens tortur such as no languag can describ this state of mind prey upon my health which had perhap never entir recov from the first shock it had sustain i shun the face of man all sound of joy or complac was tortur to me solitud was my onli consolationdeep dark deathlik solitud my father observ with pain the alter percept in my disposit and habit and endeavour by argument deduc from the feel of his seren conscienc and guiltless life to inspir me with fortitud and awaken in me the courag to dispel the dark cloud which brood over me do you think victor said he that i do not suffer also no one could love a child more than i love your brothertear came into his eye as he spokebut is it not a duti to the survivor that we should refrain from augment their unhappi by an appear of immoder grief it is also a duti owe to yourself for excess sorrow prevent improv or enjoy or even the discharg of daili use without which no man is fit for societi this advic although good was total inapplic to my case i should have been the first to hide my grief and consol my friend if remors had not mingl it bitter and terror it alarm with my other sensat now i could onli answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view about this time we retir to our hous at belriv this chang was particular agreeabl to me the shut of the gate regular at ten oclock and the imposs of remain on the lake after that hour had render our resid within the wall of geneva veri irksom to me i was now free often after the rest of the famili had retir for the night i took the boat and pass mani hour upon the water sometim with my sail set i was carri by the wind and sometim after row into the middl of the lake i left the boat to pursu it own cours and gave way to my own miser reflect i was often tempt when all was at peac around me and i the onli unquiet thing that wander restless in a scene so beauti and heavenlyif i except some bat or the frog whose harsh and interrupt croak was heard onli when i approach the shoreoften i say i was tempt to plung into the silent lake that the water might close over me and my calam forev but i was restrain when i thought of the heroic and suffer elizabeth whom i tender love and whose exist was bound up in mine i thought also of my father and surviv brother should i by my base desert leav them expos and unprotect to the malic of the fiend whom i had let loos among them at these moment i wept bitter and wish that peac would revisit my mind onli that i might afford them consol and happi but that could not be remors extinguish everi hope i had been the author of unalter evil and i live in daili fear lest the monster whom i had creat should perpetr some new wicked i had an obscur feel that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime which by it enorm should almost effac the recollect of the past there was alway scope for fear so long as anyth i love remain behind my abhorr of this fiend cannot be conceiv when i thought of him i gnash my teeth my eye becam inflam and i ardent wish to extinguish that life which i had so thoughtless bestow when i reflect on his crime and malic my hatr and reveng burst all bound of moder i would have made a pilgrimag to the highest peak of the andes could i when there have precipit him to their base i wish to see him again that i might wreak the utmost extent of abhorr on his head and aveng the death of william and justin our hous was the hous of mourn my father health was deepli shaken by the horror of the recent event elizabeth was sad and despond she no longer took delight in her ordinari occup all pleasur seem to her sacrileg toward the dead etern woe and tear she then thought was the just tribut she should pay to innoc so blast and destroy she was no longer that happi creatur who in earlier youth wander with me on the bank of the lake and talk with ecstasi of our futur prospect the first of those sorrow which are sent to wean us from the earth had visit her and it dim influenc quench her dearest smile when i reflect my dear cousin said she on the miser death of justin moritz i no longer see the world and it work as they befor appear to me befor i look upon the account of vice and injustic that i read in book or heard from other as tale of ancient day or imaginari evil at least they were remot and more familiar to reason than to the imagin but now miseri has come home and men appear to me as monster thirst for each other blood yet i am certain unjust everybodi believ that poor girl to be guilti and if she could have commit the crime for which she suffer assur she would have been the most deprav of human creatur for the sake of a few jewel to have murder the son of her benefactor and friend a child whom she had nurs from it birth and appear to love as if it had been her own i could not consent to the death of ani human be but certain i should have thought such a creatur unfit to remain in the societi of men but she was innoc i know i feel she was innoc you are of the same opinion and that confirm me ala victor when falsehood can look so like the truth who can assur themselv of certain happi i feel as if i were walk on the edg of a precipic toward which thousand are crowd and endeavour to plung me into the abyss william and justin were assassin and the murder escap he walk about the world free and perhap respect but even if i were condemn to suffer on the scaffold for the same crime i would not chang place with such a wretch i listen to this discours with the extremest agoni i not in deed but in effect was the true murder elizabeth read my anguish in my counten and kind take my hand said my dearest friend you must calm yourself these event have affect me god know how deepli but i am not so wretch as you are there is an express of

descend but i present found a great alter in my sensat befor dark and opaqu bodi had surround me impervi to my touch or sight but i now found that i could wander on at liberti with no obstacl which i could not either surmount or avoid the light becam more and more oppress to me and the heat weari me as i walk i sought a place where i could receiv shade this was the forest near ingolstadt and here i lay by the side of a brook rest from my fatigu until i felt torment by hunger and thirst this rous me from my near dormant state and i ate some berri which i found hang on the tree or lie on the ground i slake my thirst at the brook and then lie down was overcom by sleep it was dark when i awok i felt cold also and half frighten as it were instinct find myself so desol befor i had quit your apart on a sensat of cold i had cover myself with some cloth but these were insuffici to secur me from the dew of night i was a poor helpless miser wretch i knew and could distinguish noth but feel pain invad me on all side i sat down and wept soon a gentl light stole over the heaven and gave me a sensat of pleasur i start up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the tree the moon i gaze with a kind of wonder it move slowli but it enlighten my path and i again went out in search of berri i was still cold when under one of the tree i found a huge cloak with which i cover myself and sat down upon the ground no distinct idea occupi my mind all was confus i felt light and hunger and thirst and dark innumer sound rang in my ear and on all side various scent salut me the onli object that i could distinguish was the bright moon and i fix my eye on that with pleasur sever chang of day and night pass and the orb of night had great lessen when i began to distinguish my sensat from each other i gradual saw plain the clear stream that suppli me with drink and the tree that shade me with their foliag i was delight when i first discov that a pleasant sound which often salut my ear proceed from the throat of the littl wing anim who had often intercept the light from my eye i began also to observ with greater accuraci the form that surround me and to perceiv the boundari of the radiant roof of light which canopi me sometim i tri to imit the pleasant song of the bird but was unabl sometim i wish to express my sensat in my own mode but the uncouth and inarticul sound which broke from me frighten me into silenc again the moon had disappear from the night and again with a lessen form show itself while i still remain in the forest my sensat had by this time becom distinct and my mind receiv everi day addit idea my eye becam accustom to the light and to perceiv object in their right form i distinguish the insect from the herb and by degre one herb from anoth i found that the sparrow utter none but harsh note whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and entic one day when i was oppress by cold i found a fire which had been left by some wander beggar and was overcom with delight at the warmth i experienc from it in my joy i thrust my hand into the live ember but quick drew it out again with a cri of pain how strang i thought that the same caus should produc such opposit effect i examin the materi of the fire and to my joy found it to be compos of wood i quick collect some branch but they were wet and would not burn i was pain at this and sat still watch the oper of the fire the wet wood which i had place near the heat dri and itself becam inflam i reflect on this and by touch the various branch i discov the caus and busi myself in collect a great quantiti of wood that i might dri it and have a plenti suppli of fire when night came on and brought sleep with it i was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguish i cover it care with dri wood and leav and place wet branch upon it and then spread my cloak i lay on the ground and sank into sleep it was morn when i awok and my first care was to visit the fire i uncov it and a gentl breez quick fan it into a flame i observ this also and contriv a fan of branch which rous the ember when they were near extinguish when night came again i found with pleasur that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discoveri of this element was use to me in my food for i found some of the offal that the travel had left had been roast and tast much more savouri than the berri i gather from the tree i tri therefor to dress my food in the same manner place it on the live ember i found that the berri were spoil by this oper and the nut and root much improv food howev becam scarc and i often spent the whole day search in vain for a few acorn to assuag the pang of hunger when i found this i resolv to quit the place that i had hitherto inhabit to seek for one where the few want i experienc would be more easili satisfi in this emigr i exceed lament the loss of the fire which i had obtain through accid and knew not how to reproduc it i gave sever hour to the serious consider of this difficulti but i was oblig to relinquish all attempt to suppli it and wrap myself up in my cloak i struck across the wood toward the set sun i pass three day in these rambl and at length discov the open countri a great fall of snow had taken place the night befor and the field were of one uniform white the appear was disconsol and i found my feet chill by the cold damp substanc that cover the ground it was about seven in the morn and i long to obtain food and shelter at length i perceiv a small hut on a rise ground which had doubtless been built for the conveni of some shepherd this was a new sight to me and i examin the structur with great curios find the door open i enter an old man sat in it near a fire over which he was prepar his breakfast he turn on hear a nois and perceiv me shriek loud and quit the hut ran across the field with a speed of which his debilit form hard appear capabl his appear differ from ani i had ever befor seen and his flight somewhat surpris me but i was enchant by the appear of the hut here the snow and rain could not penetr the ground was dri and it present to me then as exquisit and divin a retreat as pandemonium appear to the demon of hell after their suffer in the lake of fire i greedili devour the remnant of the shepherd breakfast which consist of bread chees milk and wine the latter howev i did not like then overcom by fatigu i lay down among some straw and fell asleep it was noon when i awok and allur by the warmth of the sun which shone bright on the white ground i determin to recomm my travel and deposit the remain of the peasant breakfast in a wallet i found i proceed across the field for sever hour until at sunset i arriv at a villag how miracul did this appear the hut the neater cottag and state hous engag my admir by turn the veget in the garden the milk and chees that i saw place at the window of some of the cottag allur my appetit one of the best of these i enter but i had hard place my foot within the door befor the children shriek and one of the women faint the whole villag was rous some fled some attack me until grievous bruis by stone and mani other kind of missil weapon i escap to the open countri and fear took refug in a low hovel quit bare and make a wretch appear after the palac i had beheld in the villag this hovel howev join a cottag of a neat and pleasant appear but after my late dear bought experi i dare not enter it my place of refug was construct of wood but so low that i could with difficulti sit upright in it no wood howev was place on the earth which form the floor but it was dri and although the wind enter it by innumer chink i found it an agreeabl asylum from the snow and rain here then i retreat and lay down happi to have found a shelter howev miser from the inclem of the season and still more from the barbar of man as soon as morn dawn i crept from my kennel that i might view the adjac cottag and discov if i could remain in the habit i had found it was situat against the back of the cottag and surround on the side which were expos by a pig sti and a clear pool of water one part was open and by that i had crept in but now i cover everi crevic by which i might be perceiv with stone and wood yet in such a manner that i might move them on occas to pass out all the light i enjoy came through the sti and that was suffici for me have thus arrang my dwell and carpet it with clean straw i retir for i saw the figur of a man at a distanc and i rememb too well my treatment the night befor to trust myself in his power i had first howev provid for my susten for that day by a loaf of coars bread which i purloin and a cup with which i could drink more conveni than from my hand of the pure water which flow by my retreat the floor was a littl rais so that it was kept perfect dri and by it vicin to the chimney of the cottag it was toler warm be thus provid i resolv to resid in this hovel until someth should occur which might alter my determin it was inde a paradis compar to the bleak forest my former resid the rain drop branch and dank earth i ate my breakfast with pleasur and was about to remov a plank to procur myself a littl water when i heard a step and look through a small chink i beheld a young creatur with a pail on her head pass befor my hovel the girl was young and of gentl demeanour unlik what i have sinc found cottag and farmhous servant to be yet she was mean dress a coars blue petticoat and a linen jacket be her onli garb her fair hair was plait but not adorn she look patient yet sad i lost sight of her and in about a quarter of an hour she return bear the pail which was now part fill with milk as she walk along seem incommod by the burden a young man met her whose counten express a deeper despond utter a few sound with an air of melancholi he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottag himself she follow and they disappear present i saw the young man again with some tool in his hand cross the field behind the cottag and the girl was also busi sometim in the hous and sometim in the yard on examin my dwell i found that one of the window of the cottag had former occupi a part of it but the pane had been fill up with wood in one of these was a small and almost impercept chink through which the eye could just penetr through this crevic a small room was visibl whitewash and clean but veri bare of furnitur in one corner near a small fire sat an old man lean his head on his hand in a disconsol attitud the young girl was occupi in arrang the cottag but present she took someth out of a drawer which employ her hand and she sat down besid the old man who take up an instrument began to play and to produc sound sweeter than the voic of the thrush or the nightingal it was a love sight even to me poor wretch who had never beheld aught beauti befor the silver hair and benevol counten of the age cottag won my rever while the gentl manner of the girl entic my love he play a sweet mourn air which i perceiv drew tear from the eye of his amiabl companion of which the old man took no notic until she sob audibl he then pronounc a few sound and the fair creatur leav her work knelt at his feet he rais her and smile with such kind and affect that i felt sensat of a peculiar and overpow natur they were a mixtur of pain and pleasur such as i had never befor experienc either from hunger or cold warmth or food and i withdrew from the window unabl to bear these emot soon after this the young man return bear on his shoulder a load of wood the girl met him at the door help to reliev him of his burden and take some of the fuel into the cottag place it on the fire then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottag and he show her a larg loaf and a piec of chees she seem pleas and went into the garden for some root and plant which she place in water and then upon the fire she afterward continu her work whilst the young man went into the garden and appear busili employ in dig and pull up root after he had been employ thus about an hour the young woman join him and they enter the cottag togeth the old man had in the meantim been pensiv but on the appear of his companion he assum a more cheer air and they sat down to eat the meal was quick dispatch the young woman was again occupi in arrang the cottag the old man walk befor the cottag in the sun for a few minut lean on the arm of the youth noth could exceed in beauti the contrast between these two excel creatur one was old with silver hair and a counten beam with benevol and love the younger was slight and grace in his figur and his featur were mould with the finest symmetri yet his eye and attitud express the utmost sad and despond the old man return to the cottag and the youth with tool differ from those he had use in the morn direct his step across the field night quick shut in but to my extrem wonder i found that the cottag had a mean of prolong light by the use of taper and was delight to find that the set of the sun did not put an end to the pleasur i experienc in watch my human neighbour in the even the young girl and her companion were employ in various occup which i did not understand and the old man again took up the instrument which produc the divin sound that had enchant me in the morn so soon as he had finish the youth began not to play but to utter sound that were monoton and neither resembl the harmoni of the old man instrument nor the song of the bird i sinc found that he read aloud but at that time i knew noth of the scienc of word or letter the famili after have been thus occupi for a short time extinguish their light and retir as i conjectur to rest chapter 12 i lay on my straw but i could not sleep i thought of the occurr of the day what chiefli struck me was the gentl manner of these peopl and i long to join them but dare not i rememb too well the treatment i had suffer the night befor from the barbar villag and resolv whatev cours of conduct i might hereaft think it right to pursu that for the present i would remain quiet in my hovel watch and endeavour to discov the motiv which influenc their action the cottag aros the next morn befor the sun the young woman arrang the cottag and prepar the food and the youth depart after the first meal this day was pass in the same routin as that which preced it the young man was constant employ out of door and the girl in various labori occup within the old man whom i soon perceiv to be blind employ his leisur hour on his instrument or in contempl noth could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottag exhibit toward their vener companion they perform toward him everi littl offic of affect and duti with gentl and he reward them by his benevol smile they were not entir happi the young man and his companion often went apart and appear to weep i saw no caus for their unhappi but i was deepli affect by it if such love creatur were miser it was less strang that i an imperfect and solitari be should be wretch yet whi were these gentl be unhappi they possess a delight hous for such it was in my eye and everi luxuri they had a fire to warm them when chill and delici viand when hungri they were dress in excel cloth and still more they enjoy one anoth compani and speech interchang each day look of affect and kind what did their tear impli did they realli express pain i was at first unabl to solv these question but perpetu attent and time explain to me mani appear which were at first enigmat a consider period elaps befor i discov one of the caus of the uneasi of this amiabl famili it was poverti and they suffer that evil in a veri distress degre their nourish consist entir of the veget of their garden and the milk of one cow which gave veri littl dure the winter when it master could scarc procur food to support it they often i believ suffer the pang of hunger veri poignant especi the two younger cottag for sever time they place food befor the old man when they reserv none for themselv this trait of kind move me sensibl i had been accustom dure the night to steal a part of their store for my own consumpt but when i found that in do this i inflict pain on the cottag i abstain and satisfi myself with berri nut and root which i gather from a neighbour wood i discov also anoth mean through which i was enabl to assist their labour i found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collect wood for the famili fire and dure the night i often took his tool the use of which i quick discov and brought home fire suffici for the consumpt of sever day i rememb the first time that i did this the young woman when she open the door in the morn appear great astonish on see a great pile of wood on the outsid she utter some word in a loud voic and the youth join her who also express surpris i observ with pleasur that he did not go to the forest that day but spent it in repair the cottag and cultiv the garden by degre i made a discoveri of still greater moment i found that these peopl possess a method of communic their experi and feel to one anoth by articul sound i perceiv that the word they spoke sometim produc pleasur or pain smile or sad in the mind and counten of the hearer this was inde a godlik scienc and i ardent desir to becom acquaint with it but i was baffl in everi attempt i made for this purpos their pronunci was quick and the word they utter not have ani appar connect with visibl object i was unabl to discov ani clue by which i could unravel the mysteri of their refer by great applic howev and after have remain dure the space of sever revolut of the moon in my hovel i discov the name that were given to some of the most familiar object of discours i learn and appli the word fire milk bread and wood i learn also the name of the cottag themselv the youth and his companion had each of them sever name but the old man had onli one which was father the girl was call sister or agatha and the youth felix brother or son i cannot describ the delight i felt when i learn the idea appropri to each of these sound and was abl to pronounc them i distinguish sever other word without be abl as yet to understand or appli them such as good dearest unhappi i spent the winter in this manner the gentl manner and beauti of the cottag great endear them to me when they were unhappi i felt depress when they rejoic i sympath in their joy i saw few human be besid them and if ani other happen to enter the cottag their harsh manner and rude gait onli enhanc to me the superior accomplish of my friend the old man i could perceiv often endeavour to encourag his children as sometim i found that he call them to cast off their melancholi he would talk in a cheer accent with an express of good that bestow pleasur even upon me agatha listen with respect her eye sometim fill with tear which she endeavour to wipe away unperceiv but i general found that her counten and tone were more cheer after have listen to the exhort of her father it was not thus with felix he was alway the saddest of the group and even to my unpractis sens he appear to have suffer more deepli than his friend but if his counten was more sorrow his voic was more cheer than that of his sister especi when he address the old man i could mention innumer instanc which although slight mark the disposit of these amiabl cottag in the midst of poverti and want felix carri with pleasur to his sister the first littl white flower that peep out from beneath the snowi ground earli in the morn befor she had risen he clear away the snow that obstruct her path to the milk hous drew water from the well and brought the wood from the outhous where to his perpetu astonish he found his store alway replenish by an invis hand in the day i believ he work sometim for a neighbour farmer becaus he often went forth and did not return until dinner yet brought no wood with him at other time he work in the garden but as there was littl to do in the frosti season he read to the old man and agatha this read had puzzl me extrem at first but by degre i discov that he utter mani of the same sound when he read as when he talk i conjectur therefor that he found on the paper sign for speech which he understood and i ardent long to comprehend these also but how was that possibl when i did not even understand the sound for which they stood as sign i improv howev sensibl in this scienc but not suffici to follow up ani kind of convers although i appli my whole mind to the endeavour for i easili perceiv that although i eager long to discov myself to the cottag i ought not to make the attempt until i had first becom master of their languag which knowledg might enabl me to make them overlook the deform of my figur for with this also the contrast perpetu present to my eye had made me acquaint i had admir the perfect form of my cottagerstheir grace beauti and delic complexion but how was i terrifi when i view myself in a transpar pool at first i start back unabl to believ that it was inde i who was reflect in the mirror and when i becam fulli convinc that i was in realiti the monster that i am i was fill with the bitterest sensat of despond and mortif ala i did not yet entir know the fatal effect of this miser deform as the sun becam warmer and the light of day longer the snow vanish and i beheld the bare tree and the black earth from this time felix was more employ and the heart move indic of impend famin disappear their food as i afterward found was coars but it was wholesom and they procur a suffici of it sever new kind of plant sprang up in the garden which they dress and these sign of comfort increas daili as the season advanc the old man lean on his son walk each day at noon when it did not rain as i found it was call when the heaven pour forth it water this frequent took place but a high wind quick dri the earth and the season becam far more pleasant than it had been my mode of life in my hovel was uniform dure the morn i attend the motion of the cottag and when they were dispers in various occup i slept the remaind of the day was spent in observ my friend when they had retir to rest if there was ani moon or the night was star light i went into the wood and collect my own food and fuel for the cottag when i return as often as it was necessari i clear their path from the snow and perform those offic that i had seen done by felix i afterward found that these labour perform by an invis hand great astonish them and onc or twice i heard them on these occas utter the word good spirit wonder but i did not then understand the signif of these term my thought now becam more activ and i long to discov the motiv and feel of these love creatur i was inquisit to know whi felix appear so miser and agatha so sad i thought foolish wretch that it might be in my power to restor happi to these deserv peopl when i slept or was absent the form of the vener blind father the gentl agatha and the excel felix flit befor me i look upon them as superior be who would be the arbit of my futur destini i form in my imagin a thousand pictur of present myself to them and their recept of me i imagin that they would be disgust until by my gentl demeanour and concili word i should first win their favour and afterward their love these thought exhilar me and led me to appli with fresh ardour to the acquir the art of languag my organ were inde harsh but suppl and although my voic was veri unlik the soft music of their tone yet i pronounc such word as i understood with toler eas it was as the ass and the lap dog yet sure the gentl ass whose intent were affection although his manner were rude deserv better treatment than blow and execr the pleasant shower and genial warmth of spring great alter the aspect of the earth men who befor this chang seem to have been hid in cave dispers themselv and were employ in various art of cultiv the bird sang in more cheer note and the leav began to bud forth on the tree happi happi earth fit habit for god which so short a time befor was bleak damp and unwholesom my spirit were elev by the enchant appear of natur the past was blot from my memori the present was tranquil and the futur gild by bright ray of hope and anticip of joy chapter 13 i now hasten to the more move part of my stori i shall relat event that impress me with feel which from what i had been have made me what i am spring advanc rapid the weather becam fine and the sky cloudless it surpris me that what befor was desert and gloomi should now bloom with the most beauti flower and verdur my sens were gratifi and refresh by a thousand scent of delight and a thousand sight of beauti it was on one of these day when my cottag period rest from labourth old man play on his guitar and the children listen to himthat i observ the counten of felix was melancholi beyond express he sigh frequent and onc his father paus in his music and i conjectur by his manner that he inquir the caus of his son sorrow felix repli in a cheer accent and the old man was recommenc his music when someon tap at the door it was a ladi on horseback accompani by a countri man as a guid the ladi was dress in a dark suit and cover with a thick black veil agatha ask a question to which the stranger onli repli by pronounc in a sweet accent the name of felix her voic was music but unlik that of either of my friend on hear this word felix came up hastili to the ladi who when she saw him threw up her veil and i beheld a counten of angel beauti and express her hair of a shine raven black and curious braid her eye were dark but gentl although anim her featur of a regular proport and her complexion wondrous fair each cheek ting with a love pink felix seem ravish with delight when he saw her everi trait of sorrow vanish from his face and it instant express a degre of ecstat joy of which i could hard have believ it capabl his eye sparkl as his cheek flush with pleasur and at that moment i thought him as beauti as the stranger she appear affect by differ feel wipe a few tear from her love eye she held out her hand to felix who kiss it raptur and call her as well as i could distinguish his sweet arabian she did not appear to understand him but smile he assist her to dismount and dismiss her guid conduct her into the cottag some convers took place between him and his father and the young stranger knelt at the old man feet and would have kiss his hand but he rais her and embrac her affection i soon perceiv that although the stranger utter articul sound and appear to have a languag of her own she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottag they made mani sign which i did not comprehend but i saw that her presenc diffus glad through the cottag dispel their sorrow as the sun dissip the morn mist felix seem peculiar happi and with smile of delight welcom his arabian agatha the ever gentl agatha kiss the hand of the love stranger and point to her brother made sign which appear to me to mean that he had been sorrow until she came some hour pass thus while they by their counten express joy the caus of which i did not comprehend present i found by the frequent recurr of some sound which the stranger repeat after them that she was endeavour to learn their languag and the idea instant occur to me that i should make use of the same instruct to the same end the stranger learn about twenti word at the first lesson most of them inde were those which i had befor understood but i profit by the other as night came on agatha and the arabian retir earli when they separ felix kiss the hand of the stranger and said good night sweet safi he sat up much longer convers with his father and by the frequent repetit of her name i conjectur that their love guest was the subject of their convers i ardent desir to understand them and bent everi faculti toward that purpos but found it utter imposs the next morn felix went out to his work and after the usual occup of agatha were finish the arabian sat at the feet of the old man and take his guitar play some air so entranc beauti that they at onc drew tear of sorrow and delight from my eye she sang and her voic flow in a rich cadenc swell or die away like a nightingal of the wood when she had finish she gave the guitar to agatha who at first declin it she play a simpl air and her voic accompani it in sweet accent but unlik the wondrous strain of the stranger the old man appear enraptur and said some word which agatha endeavour to explain to safi and by which he appear to wish to express that she bestow on him the greatest delight by her music the day now pass as peaceabl as befor with the sole alter that joy had taken place of sad in the counten of my friend safi was alway gay and happi she and i improv rapid in the knowledg of languag so that in two month i began to comprehend most of the word utter by my protector in the meanwhil also the black ground was cover with herbag and the green bank interspers with innumer flower sweet to the scent and the eye star of pale radianc among the moonlight wood the sun becam warmer the night clear and balmi and my nocturn rambl were an extrem pleasur to me although they were consider shorten by the late set and earli rise of the sun for i never ventur abroad dure daylight fear of meet with the same treatment i had former endur in the first villag which i enter my day were spent in close attent that i might more speedili master the languag and i may boast that i improv more rapid than the arabian who understood veri littl and convers in broken accent whilst i comprehend and could imit almost everi word that was spoken while i improv in speech i also learn the scienc of letter as it was taught to the stranger and this open befor me a wide field for wonder and delight the book from which felix instruct safi was volney ruin of empir i should not have understood the purport of this book had not felix in read it given veri minut explan he had chosen this work he said becaus the declamatori style was frame in imit of the eastern author through this work i obtain a cursori knowledg of histori and a view of the sever empir at present exist in the world it gave me an insight into the manner govern and religion of the differ nation of the earth i heard of the sloth asiat of the stupend genius and mental activ of the grecian of the war and wonder virtu of the earli romansof their subsequ degeneratingof the declin of that mighti empir of chivalri christian and king i heard of the discoveri of the american hemispher and wept with safi over the hapless fate of it origin inhabit these wonder narrat inspir me with strang feel was man inde at onc so power so virtuous and magnific yet so vicious and base he appear at one time a mere scion of the evil principl and at anoth as all that can be conceiv of nobl and godlik to be a great and virtuous man appear the highest honour that can befal a sensit be to be base and vicious as mani on record have been appear the lowest degrad a condit more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm for a long time i could not conceiv how one man could go forth to murder his fellow or even whi there were law and govern but when i heard detail of vice and bloodsh my wonder ceas and i turn away with disgust and loath everi convers of the cottag now open new wonder to me while i listen to the instruct which felix bestow upon the arabian the strang system of human societi was explain to me i heard of the divis of properti of immens wealth and squalid poverti of rank descent and nobl blood the word induc me to turn toward myself i learn that the possess most esteem by your fellow creatur were high and unsulli descent unit with rich a man might be respect with onli one of these advantag but without either he was consid except in veri rare instanc as a vagabond and a slave doom to wast his power for the profit of the chosen few and what was i of my creation and creator i was absolut ignor but i knew that i possess no money no friend no kind of properti i was besid endu with a figur hideous deform and loathsom i was not even of the same natur as man i was more agil than they and could subsist upon coarser diet i bore the extrem of heat and cold with less injuri to my frame my statur far exceed their when i look around i saw and heard of none like me was i then a monster a

virtu and good feel and love the gentl manner and amiabl qualiti of my cottag but i was shut out from intercours with them except through mean which i obtain by stealth when i was unseen and unknown and which rather increas than satisfi the desir i had of becom one among my fellow the gentl word of agatha and the anim smile of the charm arabian were not for me the mild exhort of the old man and the live convers of the love felix were not for me miser unhappi wretch other lesson were impress upon me even more deepli i heard of the differ of sex and the birth and growth of children how the

should have ad to my sagac sever chang in the meantim took place in the cottag the presenc of safi diffus happi among it inhabit and i also found that a greater degre of plenti reign there felix and agatha spent more time in amus and convers and were assist in their labour by servant they did not appear rich but they were content and happi their feel were seren and peac while mine becam everi day more tumultu increas of knowledg onli discov to me more clear what a wretch outcast i was i cherish hope it is true but it vanish when i beheld my person reflect in water or my shadow in the moonshin even as that frail imag and that inconst shade i endeavour to crush these fear and to fortifi myself for the trial which in a few month i resolv to undergo and sometim i allow my thought uncheck by

grief the leav decay and fall and natur again assum the barren and bleak appear it had worn when i first beheld the wood and the love moon yet i did not heed the bleak of the weather i was better fit by my conform for the endur of cold than heat but my chief delight were the sight of the flower the bird and all the gay apparel of summer when those desert me i turn with more attent toward the cottag their happi was not decreas by the absenc of summer they love and sympath with one anoth and their joy depend on each other were not interrupt by the casualti that took place around them the

this time was sole direct toward my plan of introduc myself into the cottag of my protector i revolv mani project but that on which i final fix was to enter the dwell when the blind old man should be alon i had sagac enough to discov that the unnatur hideous of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had former beheld me my voic although harsh had noth terribl in it i thought

form flung by the murder on it bridal bier could i behold this and live ala life is obstin and cling closest where it is most hate for a moment onli did i lose recollect i fell senseless on the ground when i recov i found myself surround by the peopl of the inn their counten express a breathless terror but the horror of other appear onli as a mockeri a shadow of the feel that oppress me i escap from them to the room where lay the bodi of elizabeth my love my wife so late live so dear so worthi she had been move from the postur in which i had first beheld her and now as she lay her head upon

held in my arm had ceas to be the elizabeth whom i had love and cherish the murder mark of the fiend grasp was on her neck and the breath had ceas to issu from her lip while i still hung over her in the agoni of despair i happen to look up the window of the room had befor been darken and i felt a kind of panic on see the pale yellow light of the moon illumin the chamber the shutter had been thrown back and with a sensat of horror not to be describ i saw at the open window a figur the most hideous and abhor a grin was on the face of the monster he seem to jeer as with his fiendish finger

heat of fever in this state i was carri back and place on a bed hard conscious of what had happen my eye wander round the room as if to seek someth that i had lost after an interv i aros and as if by instinct crawl into the room where the corps of my belov lay there were women weep around i hung over it and join my sad tear to their all this time no distinct idea present itself to my mind but my thought rambl to various subject reflect confus on my misfortun and their caus i was bewild in a cloud of wonder and horror the death of william the execut of justin the murder of clerval and last of my wife even at that moment i knew not that my onli remain friend were safe from the malign of the fiend my father even now might be writh under his grasp and ernest might be dead at his feet this idea made me shudder and recal me to action i start up and resolv to return to geneva with all possibl speed there were no hors to be procur and i must return by the lake but the wind was unfavour and the rain fell in torrent howev it was hard morn and i might reason hope to arriv by night i hire men to row and took an oar myself for i had alway experienc relief from mental torment in bodili exercis but the overflow miseri i now felt and the excess of agit that i endur render me incap of ani exert i threw down the oar and lean my head upon my hand gave way to everi gloomi idea that aros if i look up i saw scene which were familiar to me in my happier time and which i had contempl but the day befor in the compani of her who was now but a shadow and a recollect tear stream from my eye the rain had ceas for a moment and i saw the fish play in the water as they had done a few hour befor they had then been observ by elizabeth noth is so pain to the human mind as a great and sudden chang the sun might shine or the cloud might lower but noth could appear to me as it had done the day befor a fiend had snatch from me everi hope of futur happi no creatur had ever been so miser as i was so fright an event is singl in the histori of man but whi should i dwell upon the incid that follow this last overwhelm event mine has been a tale of horror i have reach their acm and what i must now relat can but be tedious to you know that one by one my friend were snatch away i was left desol my own strength is exhaust and i must tell in a few word what remain of my hideous narrat i arriv at geneva my father and ernest yet live but the former sunk under the tide that i bore i see him now excel and vener old man his eye wander in vacanc for they had lost their charm and their delighthi elizabeth his more than daughter whom he dote on with all that affect which a man feel who in the declin of life have few affect cling more earnest to those that remain curs curs be the fiend that brought miseri on his grey hair and doom him to wast in wretched he could not live under the horror that were accumul around him the spring of exist sudden gave way he was unabl to rise from his bed and in a few day he die in my arm what then becam of me i know not i lost sensat and chain and dark were the onli object that press upon me sometim inde i dreamt that i wander in floweri meadow and pleasant vale with the friend of my youth but i awok and found myself in a dungeon melancholi follow but by degre i gain a clear concept of my miseri and situat and was then releas from my prison for they had call me mad and dure mani month as i understood a solitari cell had been my habit liberti howev had been a useless gift to me had i not as i awaken to reason at the same time awaken to reveng as the memori of past misfortun press upon me i began to reflect on their causeth monster whom i had creat the miser daemon whom i had sent abroad into the world for my destruct i was possess by a madden rage when i thought of him and desir and ardent pray that i might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal reveng on his curs head nor did my hate long confin itself to useless wish i began to reflect on the best mean of secur him and for this purpos about a month after my releas i repair to a crimin judg in the town and told him that i had an accus to make that i knew the destroy of my famili and that i requir him to exert his whole author for the apprehens of the murder the magistr listen to me with attent and kind be assur sir said he no pain or exert on my part shall be spare to discov the villain i thank you repli i listen therefor to the deposit that i have to make it is inde a tale so strang that i should fear you would not credit it were there not someth in truth which howev wonder forc convict the stori is too connect to be mistaken for a dream and i have no motiv for falsehood my manner as i thus address him was impress but calm i had form in my own heart a resolut to pursu my destroy to death and this purpos quiet my agoni and for an interv reconcil me to life i now relat my histori briefli but with firm and precis mark the date with accuraci and never deviat into invect or exclam the magistr appear at first perfect incredul but as i continu he becam more attent and interest i saw him sometim shudder with horror at other a live surpris unmingl with disbelief was paint on his counten when i had conclud my narrat i said this is the be whom i accus and for whose seizur and punish i call upon you to exert your whole power it is your duti as a magistr and i believ and hope that your feel as a man will not revolt from the execut of those function on this occas this address caus a consider chang in the physiognomi of my own auditor he had heard my stori with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirit and supernatur event but when he was call upon to act offici in consequ the whole tide of his incredul return he howev answer mild i would will afford you everi aid in your pursuit but the creatur of whom you speak appear to have power which would put all my exert to defianc who can follow an anim which can travers the sea of ice and inhabit cave and den where no man would ventur to intrud besid some month have elaps sinc the commiss of his crime and no one can conjectur to what place he has wander or what region he may now inhabit i do not doubt that he hover near the spot which i inhabit and if he has inde taken refug in the alp he may be hunt like the chamoi and destroy as a beast of prey but i perceiv your thought you do not credit my narrat and do not intend to pursu my enemi with the punish which is his desert as i spoke rage sparkl in my eye the magistr was intimid you are mistaken said he i will exert myself and if it is in my power to seiz the monster be assur that he shall suffer punish proportion to his crime but i fear from what you have yourself describ to be his properti that this will prove impractic and thus while everi proper measur is pursu you should make up your mind to disappoint that cannot be but all that i can say will be of littl avail my reveng is of no moment to you yet while i allow it to be a vice i confess that it is the devour and onli passion of my soul my rage is unspeak when i reflect that the murder whom i have turn loos upon societi still exist you refus my just demand i have but one resourc and i devot myself either in my life or death to his destruct i trembl with excess of agit as i said this there was a frenzi in my manner and someth i doubt not of that haughti fierc which the martyr of old are said to have possess but to a genevan magistr whose mind was occupi by far other idea than those of devot and heroism this elev of mind had much the appear of mad he endeavour to sooth me as a nurs doe a child and revert to my tale as the effect of delirium man i cri how ignor art thou in thi pride of wisdom ceas you know not what it is you say i broke from the hous angri and disturb and retir to medit on some other mode of action chapter 24 my present situat was one in which all voluntari thought was swallow up and lost i was hurri away by furi reveng alon endow me with strength and composur it mould my feel and allow me to be calcul and calm at period when otherwis delirium or death would have been my portion my first resolut was to quit geneva forev my countri which when i was happi and belov was dear to me now in my advers becam hate i provid myself with a sum of money togeth with a few jewel which had belong to my mother and depart and now my wander began which are to ceas but with life i have travers a vast portion of the earth and have endur all the hardship which travel in desert and barbar countri are wont to meet how i have live i hard know mani time have i stretch my fail limb upon the sandi plain and pray for death but reveng kept me aliv i dare not die and leav my adversari in be when i quit geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which i might trace the step of my fiendish enemi but my plan was unsettl and i wander mani hour round the confin of the town uncertain what path i should pursu as night approach i found myself at the entranc of the cemeteri where william elizabeth and my father repos i enter it and approach the tomb which mark their grave everyth was silent except the leav of the tree which were gentl agit by the wind the night was near dark and the scene would have been solemn and affect even to an uninterest observ the spirit of the depart seem to flit around and to cast a shadow which was felt but not seen around the head of the mourner the deep grief which this scene had at first excit quick gave way to rage and despair they were dead and i live their murder also live and to destroy him i must drag out my weari exist i knelt on the grass and kiss the earth and with quiver lip exclaim by the sacr earth on which i kneel by the shade that wander near me by the deep and etern grief that i feel i swear and by thee o night and the spirit that presid over thee to pursu the daemon who caus this miseri until he or i shall perish in mortal conflict for this purpos i will preserv my life to execut this dear reveng will i again behold the sun and tread the green herbag of earth which otherwis should vanish from my eye forev and i call on you spirit of the dead and on you wander minist of vengeanc to aid and conduct me in my work let the curs and hellish monster drink deep of agoni let him feel the despair that now torment me i had begun my adjur with solemn and an awe which almost assur me that the shade of my murder friend heard and approv my devot but the furi possess me as i conclud and rage choke my utter i was answer through the still of night by a loud and fiendish laugh it rang on my ear long and heavili the mountain re echo it and i felt as if all hell surround me with mockeri and laughter sure in that moment i should have been possess by frenzi and have destroy my miser exist but that my vow was heard and that i was reserv for vengeanc the laughter die away when a well known and abhor voic appar close to my ear address me in an audibl whisper i am satisfi miser wretch you have determin to live and i am satisfi i dart toward the spot from which the sound proceed but the devil elud my grasp sudden the broad disk of the moon aros and shone full upon his ghast and distort shape as he fled with more than mortal speed i pursu him and for mani month this has been my task guid by a slight clue i follow the wind of the rhone but vain the blue mediterranean appear and by a strang chanc i saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the black sea i took my passag in the same ship but he escap i know not how amidst the wild of tartari and russia although he still evad me i have ever follow in his track sometim the peasant scare by this horrid apparit inform me of his path sometim he himself who fear that if i lost all trace of him i should despair and die left some mark to guid me the snow descend on my head and i saw the print of his huge step on the white plain to you first enter on life to whom care is new and agoni unknown how can you understand what i have felt and still feel cold want and fatigu were the least pain which i was destin to endur i was curs by some devil and carri about with me my etern hell yet still a spirit of good follow and direct my step and when i most murmur would sudden extric me from seem insurmount difficulti sometim when natur overcom by hunger sank under the exhaust a repast was prepar for me in the desert that restor and inspirit me the fare was inde coars such as the peasant of the countri ate but i will not doubt that it was set there by the spirit that i had invok to aid me often when all was dri the heaven cloudless and i was parch by thirst a slight cloud would bedim the sky shed the few drop that reviv me and vanish i follow when i could the cours of the river but the daemon general avoid these as it was here that the popul of the countri chiefli collect in other place human be were seldom seen and i general subsist on the wild anim that cross my path i had money with me and gain the friendship of the villag by distribut it or i brought with me some food that i had kill which after take a small part i alway present to those who had provid me with fire and utensil for cook my life as it pass thus was inde hate to me and it was dure sleep alon that i could tast joy o bless sleep often when most miser i sank to repos and my dream lull me even to raptur the spirit that guard me had provid these moment or rather hour of happi that i might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimag depriv of this respit i should have sunk under my hardship dure the day i was sustain and inspirit by the hope of night for in sleep i saw my friend my wife and my belov countri again i saw the benevol counten of my father heard the silver tone of my elizabeth voic and beheld clerval enjoy health and youth often when weari by a toilsom march i persuad myself that i was dream until night should come and that i should then enjoy realiti in the arm of my dearest friend what agon fond did i feel for them how did i cling to their dear form as sometim they haunt even my wake hour and persuad myself that they still live at such moment vengeanc that burn within me die in my heart and i pursu my path toward the destruct of the daemon more as a task enjoin by heaven as the mechan impuls of some power of which i was unconsci than as the ardent desir of my soul what his feel were whom i pursu i cannot know sometim inde he left mark in write on the bark of the tree or cut in stone that guid me and instig my furi my

make me a requisit which in justic i could not refus we were immur in ice and should probabl never escap but they fear that if as was possibl the ice should dissip and a free passag be open i should be rash enough to continu my voyag and lead them into fresh danger after they might happili have surmount this they insist therefor that i should engag with a solemn promis that if the vessel should be freed i would instant direct my cours southward this speech troubl me i had not despair nor had i yet conceiv the idea of return if set free yet could i in justic or even in possibl refus this

vigour turn toward the men he said what do you mean what do you demand of your captain are you then so easili turn from your design did you not call this a glorious expedit and wherefor was it

sailor saw this and that their return to their nativ countri was appar assur a shout of tumultu joy broke from them loud and long continu frankenstein who was doze awok and ask the caus of the tumult they shout i said becaus they will soon return to england do you then realli return ala yes i cannot withstand their demand i cannot lead them unwil to danger and i must return do so if you will but i will not you may give up your purpos but mine is assign to me by heaven and i dare not i am weak but sure the spirit who assist my vengeanc will endow me with suffici strength say this he endeavour to

ration creatur and was bound toward him to assur as far as was in my power his happi and well be this was my duti but there was anoth still paramount to that my duti toward the be of my own speci had greater claim to my attent becaus they includ a greater proport of happi or miseri urg by this view i refus and i did right in refus to creat a companion for the first creatur he show unparallel malign and selfish in evil he destroy my friend he devot to destruct be who possess exquisit sensat happi and wisdom nor do i know where this thirst for vengeanc may end miser himself that he may render no other wretch he ought to die the task of his destruct was mine but i have fail when actuat by selfish and vicious motiv i ask you to undertak my unfinish work and i renew this request now when i am onli induc by reason and virtu yet i cannot ask you to renounc your countri and friend to fulfil this task and now that you are return to england you will have littl chanc of meet with him but the consider of these point and the well balanc of what you may esteem your duti i leav to you my judgment and idea are alreadi disturb by the near approach of death i dare not ask you to do what

which i have enjoy for sever year the form of the belov dead flit befor me and i hasten to their arm farewel walton seek happi in tranquil and avoid ambit even if it be onli the appar innoc one of distinguish yourself in scienc and discoveri yet whi do i say this i have myself been blast in these hope yet anoth may succeed his voic becam fainter as he spoke and at length exhaust by his effort he sank into silenc about half an hour afterward he attempt again to speak but was unabl he press my hand feebli and his eye close forev while the irradi of a gentl smile pass away from his lip margaret what comment can i make on the untim extinct of this glorious spirit what can i say that will enabl you to understand the depth of my sorrow all that i should express would be inadequ and feebl my tear flow my mind is overshadow by a cloud of disappoint but i journey toward england and i may there find consol i am interrupt what do these sound portend it is midnight the breez blow fair and the watch on deck scarc stir again there is a sound as of a human voic but hoarser it come from the cabin where the remain of frankenstein still lie i must aris and examin good night my sister great god what a scene has just taken place i am yet dizzi with the remembr of it i hard know whether i shall have the power to detail it yet the tale which i have record would be incomplet without this final and wonder catastroph i enter the cabin where lay the remain of my ill fate and admir friend over him hung a form which i cannot find word to describegigant in statur yet uncouth and distort in it proport as he hung over the coffin his face was conceal by long lock of rag hair but one vast hand was extend in colour and appar textur like that of a mummi when he heard the sound of my approach he ceas to utter exclam of grief and horror and sprung toward the window never did i behold a vision so horribl as his face of such loathsom yet appal hideous i shut my eye involuntarili and endeavour to recollect what were my duti with regard to this destroy i call on him to stay he paus look on me with wonder and again turn toward the lifeless form of his creator he seem to forget my presenc and everi featur and gestur seem instig by the wildest rage of some uncontrol passion that is also my victim he exclaim in his murder my crime are consumm the miser seri of my be is wound to it close oh frankenstein generous and self devot be what doe it avail that i now ask thee to pardon me i who irretriev destroy thee by destroy all thou lovedst ala he is cold he cannot answer me his voic seem suffoc and my first impuls which had suggest to me the duti of obey the die request of my friend in destroy his enemi were now suspend by a mixtur of curios and compass i approach this tremend be i dare not again rais my eye to his face there was someth so scare and unearth in his ugli i attempt to speak but the word die away on my lip the monster continu to utter wild and incoher self reproach at length i gather resolut to address him in a paus of the tempest of his passion your repent i said is now superflu if you had listen to the voic of conscienc and heed the sting of remors befor you had urg your diabol vengeanc to this extrem frankenstein would yet have live and do you dream said the daemon do you think that i was then dead to agoni and remors he he continu point to the corps he suffer not in the consumm of the deed oh not the ten thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine dure the linger detail of it execut a fright selfish hurri me on while my heart was poison with remors think you that the groan of clerval were music to my ear my heart was fashion to be suscept of love and sympathi and when wrench by miseri to vice and hatr it did not endur the violenc of the chang without tortur such as you cannot even imagin after the murder of clerval i return to switzerland heart broken and overcom i piti frankenstein my piti amount to horror i abhor myself but when i discov that he the author at onc of my exist and of it unspeak torment dare to hope for happi that while he accumul wretched and despair upon me he sought his own enjoy in feel and passion from the indulg of which i was forev bar then impot envi and bitter indign fill me with an insati thirst for vengeanc i recollect my threat and resolv that it should be accomplish i knew that i was prepar for myself a dead tortur but i was the slave not the master of an impuls which i detest yet could not disobey yet when she die nay then i was not miser i had cast off all feel subdu all anguish to riot in the excess of my despair evil thenceforth becam my good urg thus far i had no choic but to adapt my natur to an element which i had will chosen the complet of my demoniac design becam an insati passion and now it is end there is my last victim i was at first touch by the express of his miseri yet when i call to mind what frankenstein had said of his power of eloqu and persuas and when i again cast my eye on the lifeless form of my friend indign was rekindl within me wretch i said it is well that you come here to whine over the desol that you have made you throw a torch into a pile of build and when they are consum you sit among the ruin and lament the fall hypocrit fiend if he whom you mourn still live still would he be the object again would he becom the prey of your accurs vengeanc it is not piti that you feel you lament onli becaus the victim of your malign is withdrawn from your power oh it is not thusnot thus interrupt the be yet such must be the impress convey to you by what appear to be the purport of my action yet i seek not a fellow feel in my miseri no sympathi may i ever find when i first sought it it was the love of virtu the feel of happi and affect with which my whole be overflow that i wish to be particip but now that virtu has becom to me a shadow and that happi and affect are turn into bitter and loath despair in what should i seek for sympathi i am content to suffer alon while my suffer shall endur when i die i am well satisfi that abhorr and opprobrium should load my memori onc my fanci was sooth with dream of virtu of fame and of enjoy onc i fals hope to meet with be who pardon my outward form would love me for the excel qualiti which i was capabl of unfold i was nourish with high thought of honour and devot but now crime has degrad me beneath the meanest anim no guilt no mischief no malign no miseri can be found compar to mine when i run over the fright catalogu of my sin i cannot believ that i am the same creatur whose thought were onc fill with sublim and transcend vision of the beauti and the majesti of good but it is even so the fallen angel becom a malign devil yet even that enemi of god and man had friend and associ in his desol i am alon you who call frankenstein your friend seem to have a knowledg of my crime and his misfortun but in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hour and month of miseri which i endur wast in impot passion for while i destroy his hope i did not satisfi my own desir they were forev ardent and crave still i desir love and fellowship and i was still spurn was there no injustic in this am i to be thought the onli crimin when all humankind sin against me whi do you not hate felix who drove his friend from his door with contum whi do you not execr the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child nay these are virtuous and immacul be i the miser and the abandon am an abort to be spurn at and kick and trampl on even now my blood boil at the recollect of this injustic but it is true that i am a wretch i have murder the love and the helpless i have strangl the innoc as they slept and grasp to death his throat who never injur me or ani other live thing i have devot my creator the select specimen of all that is worthi of love and admir among men to miseri i have pursu him even to that irremedi ruin there he lie white and cold in death you hate me but your abhorr cannot equal that with which i regard myself i look on the hand which execut the deed i think on the heart in which the imagin of it was conceiv and long for the moment when these hand will meet my eye when that imagin will haunt my thought no more fear not that i shall be the instrument of futur mischief my work is near complet neither your nor ani man death is need to consumm the seri of my be and accomplish that which must be done but it requir my own do not think that i shall be slow to perform this sacrific i shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extrem of the globe i shall collect my funer pile and consum to ash this miser frame that it remain may afford no light to ani curious and unhallow wretch who would creat such anoth as i have been i shall die i shall no longer feel the agoni which now consum me or be the prey of feel unsatisfi yet unquench he is dead who call me into be and when i shall be no more the veri remembr of us both will speedili vanish i shall no longer see the sun or star or feel the wind play on my cheek light feel and sens will pass away and in this condit must i find my happi some year ago when the imag which this world afford first open upon me when i felt the cheer warmth of summer and heard the rustl of the leav and the warbl of the bird and these were all to me i should have wept to die now it is my onli consol pollut by crime and torn by the bitterest remors where can i find rest but in death farewel i leav you and in you the last of humankind whom these eye will ever behold farewel frankenstein if thou wert yet aliv and yet cherish a desir of reveng against me it would be better satiat in my life than in my destruct but it was not so thou didst seek my extinct that i might not caus greater wretched and if yet in some mode unknown to me thou hadst not ceas to think and feel thou wouldst not desir against me a vengeanc greater than that which i feel blast as thou wert my agoni was still superior to thine for the bitter sting of remors will not ceas to rankl in my wound until death shall close them forev but soon he cri with sad and solemn enthusiasm i shall die and what i now feel be no longer felt soon these burn miseri will be extinct i shall ascend my funer pile triumphant and exult in the agoni of the tortur flame the light of that conflagr will fade away my ash will be swept into the sea by the wind my spirit will sleep in peac or if it think it will not sure think thus farewel he sprang from the cabin window as he said this upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel he was soon born away by the wave and lost in dark and distanc
