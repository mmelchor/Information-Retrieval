gave it never to betray him that wander but to hide the outcast and firm to abid the consequ it was at onc deepli impress upon my mind that if mr douglass could be persuad to consecr his time and talent to the promot of the anti slaveri enterpris a power impetus would be given to it and a stun blow at the same time inflict on northern prejudic against a color complexion i therefor endeavor to instil hope and courag into his mind in order that he might dare to engag in a vocat so anomal and respons for a person in his situat and i was second in this effort by warm heart friend especi by the late general agent of the massachusett anti slaveri societi mr john a collin whose judgment in this instanc entir coincid with my own at first he could give no encourag with unfeign diffid he express his convict that he was not adequ to the perform of so great a task the path mark out was wholli an untrodden one he was sincer apprehens that he should do more harm than good after much deliber howev

to an enlighten of the head and a win of the heart of other may his strength continu to be equal to his day may he continu to grow in grace and in the knowledg of god that he may be increas servic in the caus of bleed human whether at home or abroad it is certain a veri remark fact that one of the most effici advoc of the slave popul now befor the public is a fugit slave in the person of frederick douglass and that the free color popul of the unit state are as abli repres by one of their own number in the person of charl lenox remond whose eloqu appeal have extort the highest applaus of multitud on both side of the atlant let the calumni of the color race despis themselv for their base and illiber of spirit and henceforth ceas to talk of the natur inferior of those who requir noth but time and opportun to attain to the highest point of human excel it may perhap be fair question whether ani other portion of the popul of the earth could have endur the privat suffer and horror of slaveri without have becom more degrad in the scale of human than the slave of african descent noth has been left undon to crippl their intellect darken their mind debas their moral natur obliter all

extraordinari case of mental deterior it prove at least that the white slave can sink as low in the scale of human as the black one mr douglass has veri proper chosen to write his own narrat in his own style and accord to the best of his abil rather than to employ some one els it is therefor entir his own product and consid how long and dark was the career he had to run as a slavehow few have been his opportun to improv his mind sinc he broke his iron fettersit is in my judgment high credit to his head and heart he who can perus it without a tear eye a heav breast an afflict spiritwithout

life and time of frederick douglass publish in 1855 and 1881 respect he die in 1895 chapter i i was born in tuckaho near hillsborough and about twelv mile from easton in talbot counti maryland i have no accur knowledg of my age never have seen ani authent record contain it by far the larger part of the slave know as littl of their age as hors know of their and it is the wish of most master within my knowledg to keep their slave thus ignor i do not rememb to have ever met a slave who could tell of his birthday they seldom come nearer to it than plant time harvest time cherri time spring time or fall time a want of inform concern my own was a sourc of unhappi to me even dure childhood the white children could tell their age i could not tell whi i ought to be depriv of the same privileg i was not allow to make ani inquiri of my master concern it he deem all such inquiri on the part of a slave improp and impertin and evid of a restless spirit the nearest estim i can give make me now between twenti seven and twenti eight year of age i come to this from hear my master say some time dure 1835 i was about seventeen year old my mother was name harriet bailey she was the daughter of isaac and betsey bailey both color and quit dark my mother was of a darker complexion than either my grandmoth or grandfath my father was a white man he was admit to be such by all i ever heard speak of my parentag the opinion was also whisper that my master was my father but of the correct of this opinion i know noth the mean of know was withheld from me my mother and i were separ when i was but an infantbefor i knew her as my mother it is a common custom in the part of maryland from which i ran away to part children from their mother at a veri earli age frequent befor the child has reach it twelfth month it mother is taken from it and hire out on some farm a consider distanc off and the child is place under the care of an old woman too old for field labor for what this separ is done i do not know unless it be to hinder the develop of the child affect toward it mother and to blunt and destroy the natur affect of the mother for the child this is the inevit result i never saw my mother to know her as such more than four or five time in my life and each of these time was veri short in durat and at night she was hire by a mr stewart who live about twelv mile from my home she made her journey to see me in the night travel the whole distanc on foot after the perform of her day work she was a field hand and a whip is the penalti of not be in the field at sunris unless a slave has special permiss from his or her master to the contrarya permiss which they seldom get and one that give to him that give it the proud name of be a kind master i do not recollect of ever see my mother by the light of day she was with me in the night she would lie down with me and get me to sleep but long befor i wake she was gone veri littl communic ever took place between us death soon end what littl we could have while she live and with it her hardship and suffer she die when i was about seven year old on one of my master farm near lee mill i was not allow to be present dure her ill at her death or burial she was gone long befor i knew ani thing about it never have enjoy to ani consider extent her sooth presenc her tender and watch care i receiv the tide of her death with much the same emot i should have probabl felt at the death of a stranger call thus sudden away she left me without the slightest intim of who my father was the whisper that my master was my father may or may not be true and true or fals it is of but littl consequ to my purpos whilst the fact remain in all it glare odious that slavehold have ordain and by law establish that the children of slave women shall in all case follow the condit of their mother and this is done too obvious to administ to their own lust and make a gratif of their wick desir profit as well as pleasur for by this cun arrang the slavehold in case not a few sustain to his slave the doubl relat of master and father i know of such case and it is worthi of remark that such slave invari suffer greater hardship and have more to contend with than other they are in the first place a constant offenc to their mistress she is ever dispos to find fault with them they can seldom do ani thing to pleas her she is never better pleas than when she see them under the lash especi when she suspect her husband of show to his mulatto children favor which he withhold from his black slave the master is frequent compel to sell this class of his slave out of defer to the feel of his white wife and cruel as the deed may strike ani one to be for a man to sell his own children to human flesh monger it is often the dictat of human for him to do so for unless he doe this he must not onli whip them himself but must stand by and see one white son tie up his brother of but few shade darker complexion than himself and pli the gori lash to his nake back and if he lisp one word of disapprov it is set down to his parent partial and onli make a bad matter wors both for himself and the slave whom he would protect and defend everi year bring with it multitud of this class of slave it was doubtless in consequ of a knowledg of this fact that one great statesman of the south predict the downfal of slaveri by the inevit law of popul whether this propheci is ever fulfil or not it is nevertheless plain that a veri differ look class of peopl are spring up at the south and are now held in slaveri from those origin brought to this countri from africa and if their increas do no other good it will do away the forc of the argument that god curs ham and therefor american slaveri is right if the lineal descend of ham are alon to be scriptur enslav it is certain that slaveri at the south must soon becom unscriptur for thousand are usher into the world annual who like myself owe their exist to white father and those father most frequent their own master i have had two master my first master name was anthoni i do not rememb his first name he was general call captain anthonya titl which i presum he acquir by sail a craft on the chesapeak bay he was not consid a rich slavehold he own two or three farm and about thirti slave his farm and slave were under the care of an overs the overs name was plummer mr plummer was a miser drunkard a profan swearer and a savag monster he alway went arm with a cowskin and a heavi cudgel i have known him to cut and slash the women head so horribl that even master would be enrag at his cruelti and would threaten to whip him if he did not mind himself master howev was not a human slavehold it requir extraordinari barbar on the part of an overs to affect him he was a cruel man harden by a long life of slavehold he would at time seem to take great pleasur in whip a slave i have often been awaken at the dawn of day by the most heart rend shriek of an own aunt of mine whom he use to tie up to a joist and whip upon her nake back till she was liter cover with blood no word no tear no prayer from his gori victim seem to move his iron heart from it bloodi purpos the louder she scream the harder he whip and where the blood ran fastest there he whip longest he would whip her to make her scream and whip her to make her hush and not until overcom by fatigu would he ceas to swing the blood clot cowskin i rememb the first time i ever wit this horribl exhibit i was quit a child but i well rememb it i never shall forget it whilst i rememb ani thing it was the first of a long seri of such outrag of which i was doom to be a wit and a particip it struck me with aw forc it was the blood stain gate the entranc to the hell of slaveri through which i was about to pass it was a most terribl spectacl i wish i could commit to paper the feel with which i beheld it this occurr took place veri soon after i went to live with my old master and under the follow circumst aunt hester went out one nightwher or for what i do not knowand happen to be absent when my master desir her presenc he had order her not to go out even and warn her that she must never let him catch her in compani with a young man who was pay attent to her belong to colonel lloyd the young man name was ned robert general call lloyd ned whi master was so care of her may be safe left to conjectur she was a woman of nobl form and of grace proport have veri few equal and fewer superior in person appear among the color or white women of our neighborhood aunt hester had not onli disobey his order in go out but had been found in compani with lloyd ned which circumst i found from what he said while whip her was the chief offenc had he been a man of pure moral himself he might have been thought interest in protect the innoc of my aunt but those who knew him will not suspect him of ani such virtu befor he commenc whip aunt hester he took her into the kitchen and strip her from neck to waist leav her neck shoulder and back entir nake he then told her to cross her hand call her at the same time a dd b h after cross her hand he tie them with a strong rope and led her to a stool under a larg hook in the joist put in for the purpos he made her get upon the stool and tie her hand to the hook she now stood fair for his infern purpos her arm were stretch up at their full length so that she stood upon the end of her toe he then said to her now you dd b h ill learn you how to disobey my order and after roll up his sleev he commenc to lay on the heavi cowskin and soon the warm red blood amid heart rend shriek from her and horrid oath from him came drip to the floor i was so terrifi and horror stricken at the sight that i hid myself in a closet and dare not ventur out till long after the bloodi transact was over i expect it would be my turn next it was all new to me i had never seen ani thing like it befor i had alway live with my grandmoth on the outskirt of the plantat where she was put to rais the children of the younger women i had therefor been until now out of the way of the bloodi scene that often occur on the plantat chapter ii my master famili consist of two son andrew and

other caus was prevent from be readi to start for the field at the sound of the horn mr sever was right name he was a cruel man i have seen him whip a woman caus the blood to run half an hour at the time and this too in the midst of her cri children plead for their mother releas he seem to take pleasur in manifest his fiendish barbar ad to his cruelti he was a profan swearer it was enough to chill the blood and stiffen the hair of an ordinari man to hear him talk scarc a sentenc escap him but that was commenc or conclud by some horrid oath the field was the place to wit his cruelti and profan his presenc made it both the field of blood and of blasphemi from the rise till the go down of the sun he was curs rave cut and slash among the slave of the field in the most fright manner his career was short he die veri soon after i went to colonel lloyd and he die as he live utter with his die groan bitter curs and horrid oath his death was regard by the slave as the result of a merci provid mr sever place was fill by a mr hopkin he was a veri differ man he was less cruel less profan and made less nois than mr sever his cours was character by no extraordinari demonstr of cruelti he whip but seem to take no pleasur in it he was call by the slave a good overs the home plantat of colonel lloyd wore the appear of a countri villag all the mechan oper for all the farm were perform here the shoemak and mend the blacksmith cartwright cooper weav and grain grind were all perform by the slave on the home plantat the whole place wore a busi like aspect veri unlik the neighbor farm the number of hous too conspir to give it advantag over the neighbor farm it was call by the slave the great hous farm few privileg were esteem higher by the slave of the out farm than that of be select to do errand at the great hous farm it was associ in their mind with great a repres could not be prouder of his elect to a seat in the american congress than a slave on one of the out farm would be of his elect to do errand at the great hous farm they regard it as evid of great confid repos in them by their overs and it was on this account as well as a constant desir to be out of the field from under the driver lash that they esteem it a high privileg one worth care live for he was call the smartest and most trusti fellow who had this honor confer upon him the most frequent the competitor for this offic sought as dilig to pleas their overs as the offic seeker in the polit parti seek to pleas and deceiv the peopl the same trait of charact might be seen in colonel lloyd slave as are seen in the slave of the polit parti the slave select to go to the great hous farm for the month allow for themselv and their fellow slave were peculiar enthusiast while on their way they would make the dens old wood for mile around reverber with their wild song reveal at onc the highest joy and the deepest sad they would compos and sing as they went along consult neither time nor tune the thought that came up came outif not in the word in the soundand as frequent in the one as in the other they would sometim sing the most pathet sentiment in the most raptur tone and the most raptur sentiment in the most pathet tone into all of their song they would manag to weav someth of the great hous farm especi would they do this when leav home they would then sing most exult the follow word i am go away to the great hous farm o yea o yea o this they would sing as a chorus to word which to mani would seem unmean jargon but which nevertheless were full of mean to themselv i have sometim thought that the mere hear of those song would do more to impress some mind with the horribl charact of slaveri than the read of whole volum of philosophi on the subject could do i did not when a slave understand the deep mean of those rude and appar incoher song i was myself within the circl so that i neither saw nor heard as those without might see and hear they told a tale of woe which was then altogeth beyond my feebl comprehens they were tone loud long and deep they breath the prayer and complaint of soul boil over with the bitterest anguish everi tone was a testimoni against slaveri and a prayer to god for deliver from chain the hear of those wild note alway depress my spirit and fill me with ineff sad i have frequent found myself in tear while hear them the mere recurr to those song even now afflict me and while i am write these line an express of feel has alreadi found it way down my cheek to those song i trace my first glimmer concept of the dehuman charact of slaveri i can never get rid of that concept those song still follow me to deepen my hatr of slaveri and quicken my sympathi for my brethren in bond if ani one wish to be impress with the soul kill effect of slaveri let him go to colonel lloyd plantat and on allow day place himself in the deep pine wood and there let him in silenc analyz the sound that shall pass through the chamber of his souland if he is not thus impress it will onli be becaus there is no flesh in his obdur heart i have often been utter astonish sinc i came to the north to find person who could speak of the sing among slave as evid of their content and happi it is imposs to conceiv of a greater mistak slave sing most when they are most unhappi the song of the slave repres the sorrow of his heart and he is reliev by them onli as an ach heart is reliev by it tear at least such is my experi i have often sung to drown my sorrow but seldom to express my happi cri for joy and sing for joy were alik uncommon to me while in the jaw of slaveri the sing of a man cast away upon a desol island might be as appropri consid as evid of content and happi as the sing of a slave the song of the one and of the other are prompt by the same emot chapter iii colonel lloyd kept a larg and fine cultiv garden which afford almost constant employ for four men besid the chief garden mr mdurmond this garden was probabl the greatest attract of the place dure the summer month peopl came from far and nearfrom baltimor easton and annapolisto see it it abound in fruit of almost everi descript from the hardi appl of the north to the delic orang of the south this garden was not the least sourc of troubl on the plantat it excel fruit was quit a temptat to the hungri swarm of boy as well as the older slave belong to the colonel few of whom had the virtu or the vice to resist it scarc a day pass dure the summer but that some slave had to take the lash for steal fruit the colonel had to resort to all kind of stratagem to keep his slave out of the garden the last and most success one was that of tar his fenc all around after which if a slave was caught with ani tar upon his person it was deem suffici proof that he had either been into the garden or had tri to get in in either case he was sever whip by the chief garden this plan work well the slave becam as fear of tar as of the lash they seem to realiz the imposs of touch tar without be defil the colonel also kept a splendid ride equipag his stabl and carriag hous present the appear of some of our larg citi liveri establish his hors were of the finest form and noblest blood his carriag hous contain three splendid coach three or four gig besid dearborn and barouch of the most fashion style this establish was under the care of two slavesold barney and young barneyfath and son to attend to this establish was their sole work but it was by no mean an easi employ for in noth was colonel lloyd more particular than in the manag of his hors the slightest inattent to these was unpardon and was visit upon those under whose care they were place with the severest punish no excus could shield them if the colonel onli suspect ani want of attent to his horsesa supposit which he frequent indulg and one which of cours made the offic of old and young barney a veri tri one they never knew when they were safe from punish they were frequent whip when least deserv and escap whip when most deserv it everi thing depend upon the look of the hors and the state of colonel lloyd own mind when his hors were brought to him for use if a hors did not move fast enough or hold his head high enough it was owe to some fault of his keeper it was pain to stand near the stabl door and hear the various complaint against the keeper when a hors was taken out for use this hors has not had proper attent he has not been suffici rub and curri or he has not been proper fed his food was too wet or too dri he got it too soon or too late he was too hot or too cold he had too much hay and not enough of grain or he had too much grain and not enough of hay instead of old barney attend to the hors he had veri improp left it to his son to all these complaint no matter how unjust the slave must answer never a word colonel lloyd could not brook ani contradict from a slave when he spoke a slave must stand listen and trembl and such was liter the case i have seen colonel lloyd make old barney a man between fifti and sixti year of age uncov his bald head kneel down upon the cold damp ground and receiv upon his nake and toil worn shoulder more than thirti lash at the time colonel lloyd had three sonsedward murray and danieland three son in law mr winder mr nicholson and mr lownd all of these live at the great hous farm and enjoy the luxuri of whip the servant when they pleas from old barney down to william wilk the coach driver i have seen winder make one of the hous servant stand off from him a suitabl distanc to be touch with the end of his whip and at everi stroke rais great ridg upon his back to describ the wealth of colonel lloyd would be almost equal to describ the rich of job he kept from ten to fifteen hous servant he was said to own a thousand slave and i think this estim quit within the truth colonel lloyd own so mani that he did not know them when he saw them nor did all the slave of the out farm know him it is report of him that while ride along the road one day he met a color man and address him in the usual manner of speak to color peopl on the public highway of the south well boy whom do you belong to to colonel lloyd repli the slave well doe the colonel treat you well no sir was the readi repli what doe he work you too hard yes sir well dont he give you enough to eat yes sir he give me enough such as it is the colonel after ascertain where the slave belong rode on the man also went on about his busi not dream that he had been convers with his master he thought said and heard noth more of the matter until two or three week afterward the poor man was then inform by his overs that for have found fault with his master he was now to be sold to a georgia trader he was immedi chain and handcuf and thus without a moment warn he was snatch away and forev sunder from his famili and friend by a hand more unrel than death this is the penalti of tell the truth of tell the simpl truth in answer to a seri of plain question it is part in consequ of such fact that slave when inquir of as to their condit and the charact of their master almost univers say they are content and that their master are kind the slavehold have been known to send in spi among their slave to ascertain their view and feel in regard to their condit the frequenc of this has had the effect to establish among the slave the maxim that a still tongu make a wise head they suppress the truth rather than take the consequ of tell it and in so do prove themselv a part of the human famili if they have ani thing to say of their master it is general in their master favor especi when speak to an untri man i have been frequent ask when a slave if i had a kind master and do not rememb ever to have given a negat answer nor did i in pursu this cours consid myself as utter what was absolut fals for i alway measur the kind of my master by the standard of kind set up among slavehold around us moreov slave are like other peopl and imbib prejudic quit common to other they think their own better than that of other mani under the influenc of this prejudic think their own master are better than the master of other slave and this too in some case when the veri revers is true inde it is not uncommon for slave even to fall out and quarrel among themselv about the relat good of their master each contend for the superior good of his own over that of the other at the veri same time they mutual execr their master when view separ it was so on our plantat when colonel lloyd slave met the slave of jacob jepson they seldom part without a quarrel about their master colonel lloyd slave contend that he was the richest and mr jepson slave that he was the smartest and most of a man colonel lloyd slave would boast his abil to buy and sell jacob jepson mr jepson slave would boast his abil to whip colonel lloyd these quarrel would almost alway end in a fight between the parti and those that whip were suppos to have gain the point at issu they seem to think that the great of their master was transfer to themselv it was consid as be bad enough to be a slave but to be a poor man slave was deem a disgrac inde chapter iv mr hopkin remain but a short time in the offic of overs whi his career was so short i do not know but suppos he lack the necessari sever to suit colonel lloyd mr hopkin was succeed by mr austin gore a man possess in an emin degre all those trait of charact indispens to what is call a first rate overs mr gore had serv colonel lloyd in the capac of overs upon one of the out farm and had shown himself worthi of the high station of overs upon the home or great hous farm mr gore was proud ambiti and persev he was art cruel and obdur he was just the man for such a place and it was just the place for such a man it afford scope for the full exercis of all his power and he seem to be perfect at home in it he was one of those who could tortur the slightest look word or gestur on the part of the slave into impud and would treat it accord there must be no answer back to him no explan was allow a slave show himself to have been wrong accus mr gore act fulli up to the maxim laid down by slaveholdersit is better that a dozen slave should suffer under the lash than that the overs should be convict in the presenc of the slave of have been at fault no matter how innoc a slave might beit avail him noth when accus by mr gore of ani misdemeanor to be accus was to be convict and to be convict was to be punish the one alway follow the other with immut certainti to escap punish was to escap accus and few slave had the fortun to do either under the overseership of mr gore he was just proud enough to demand the most debas homag of the slave and quit servil enough to crouch himself at the feet of the master he was ambiti enough to be content with noth short of the highest rank of overs and persev enough to reach the height of his ambit he was cruel enough to inflict the severest punish art enough to descend to the lowest trickeri and obdur enough to be insens to the voic of a reprov conscienc he was of all the overs the most dread by the slave his presenc was pain his eye flash confus and seldom was his sharp shrill voic heard without produc horror and trembl in their rank mr gore was a grave man and though a young man he indulg in no joke said no funni word seldom smile his word were in perfect keep with his look and his look were in perfect keep with his word overs will sometim indulg in a witti word even with the slave not so with mr gore he spoke but to command and command but to be obey he dealt spare with his word and bounti with his whip never use the former where the latter would answer as well when he whip he seem to do so from a sens of duti and fear no consequ he did noth reluct no matter how disagre alway at his post never inconsist he never promis but to fulfil he was in a word a man of the most inflex firm and stone like cool his savag barbar was equal onli by the consumm cool with which he commit the grossest and most savag deed upon the slave under his charg mr gore onc undertook to whip one of colonel lloyd slave by the name of dembi he had given dembi but few stripe when to get rid of the scourg he ran and plung himself into a creek and stood there at the depth of his shoulder refus to come out mr gore told him that he would give him three call and that if he did not come out at the third call he would shoot him the first call was given dembi made no respons but stood his ground the second and third call were given with the same result mr gore then without consult or deliber with ani one not even give dembi an addit call rais his musket to his face take dead aim at his stand victim and in an instant poor dembi was no more his mangl bodi sank out of sight and blood and brain mark the water where he had stood a thrill of horror flash through everi soul upon the plantat except mr gore he alon seem cool and collect he was ask by colonel lloyd and my old master whi he resort to this extraordinari expedi his repli was as well as i can rememb that dembi had becom unmanag he was set a danger exampl to the other slaveson which if suffer to pass without some such demonstr on his part would final lead to the total subvers of all rule and order upon the plantat he argu that if one slave refus to be correct and escap with his life the other slave would soon copi the exampl the result of which would be the freedom of the slave and the enslav of the white mr gore defenc was satisfactori he was continu in his station as overs upon the home plantat his fame as an overs went abroad his horrid crime was not even submit to judici investig it was commit in the presenc of slave and they of cours could neither institut a suit nor testifi against him and thus the guilti perpetr of one of the bloodiest and most foul murder goe unwhip of justic and uncensur by the communiti in which he live mr gore live in st michael talbot counti maryland when i left there and if he is still aliv he veri probabl live there now and if so he is now as he was then as high esteem and as much respect as though his guilti soul had not been stain with his brother blood i speak advis when i say thisthat kill a slave or ani color person in talbot counti maryland is not treat as a crime either by the court or the communiti mr thoma lanman of st michael kill two slave one of whom he kill with a hatchet by knock his brain out he use to boast of the commiss of the aw and bloodi deed i have heard him do so laugh say among other thing that he was the onli benefactor of his countri in the compani and that when other would do as much as he had done we should be reliev of the dd nigger the wife of mr gile hick live but a short distanc from where i use to live murder my wife cousin a young girl between fifteen and sixteen year of age mangl her person in the most horribl manner break her nose and breastbon with a stick so that the poor girl expir in a few hour afterward she was immedi buri but had not been in her untim grave but a few hour befor she was taken up and examin by the coron who decid that she had come to her death by sever beat the offenc for which this girl was thus murder was thissh had been set that night to mind mrs hickss babi and dure the night she fell asleep and the babi cri she have lost her rest for sever night previous did not hear the cri they were both in the room with mrs hick mrs hick find the girl slow to move jump from her bed seiz an oak stick of wood by the fireplac and with it broke the girl nose and breastbon and thus end her life i will not say that this most horrid murder produc no sensat in the communiti it did produc sensat but not enough to bring the murderess to punish there was a warrant issu for her arrest but it was never serv thus she escap not onli punish but even the pain of be arraign befor a court for her horrid crime whilst i am detail bloodi deed which took place dure my stay on colonel lloyd plantat i will briefli narrat anoth which occur about the same time as the murder of dembi by mr gore colonel lloyd slave were in the habit of spend a part of their night and sunday in fish for oyster and in this way made up the defici of their scanti allow an old man belong to colonel lloyd while thus engag happen to get beyond the limit of colonel lloyd and on the premis of mr beal bond at this trespass mr bond took offenc and with his musket came down to the shore and blew it dead content into the poor old man mr bond came over to see colonel lloyd the next day whether to pay him for his properti or to justifi himself in what he had done i know not at ani rate this whole fiendish transact was soon hush up there was veri littl said about it at all and noth done it was a common say even among littl white boy that it was worth a half cent to kill a nigger and a half cent to buri one chapter v as to my own treatment while i live on colonel lloyd plantat it was veri similar to that of the other slave children i was not old enough to work in the field and there be littl els than field work to do i had a great deal of leisur time the most i had to do was to drive up the cow at even keep the fowl out of the garden keep the front yard clean and run of errand for my old master daughter mrs lucretia auld the most of my leisur time i spent in help master daniel lloyd in find his bird after he had shot them my connect with master daniel was of some advantag to me he becam quit attach to me and was a sort of protector of me he would not allow the older boy to impos upon me and would divid his cake with me i was seldom whip by my old master and suffer littl from ani thing els than hunger and cold i suffer much from hunger but much more from cold in hottest summer and coldest winter i was kept almost nakedno shoe no stock no jacket no trouser noth on but a coars tow linen shirt reach onli to my knee i had no bed i must have perish with cold but that the coldest night i use to steal a bag which was use for carri corn to the mill i would crawl into this bag and there sleep on the cold damp clay floor with my head in and feet out my feet have been so crack with the frost that the pen with which i am write might be laid in the gash we were not regular allowanc our food was coars corn meal boil this was call mush it was put into a larg wooden tray or trough and set down upon the ground the children were then call like so mani pig and like so mani pig they would come and devour the mush some with oyster shell other with piec of shingl some with nake hand and none with spoon he that ate fastest got most he that was strongest secur the best place and few left the trough satisfi i was probabl between seven and eight year old when i left colonel lloyd plantat i left it with joy i shall never forget the ecstasi with which i receiv the intellig that my old master anthoni had determin to let me go to baltimor to live with mr hugh auld brother to my old master son in law captain thoma auld i receiv this inform about three day befor my departur they were three of the happiest day i ever enjoy i spent the most part of all these three day in the creek wash off the plantat scurf and prepar myself for my departur the pride of appear which this would indic was not my own i spent the time in wash not so much becaus i wish to but becaus mrs lucretia had told me i must get all the dead skin off my feet and knee befor i could go to baltimor for the peopl in baltimor were veri clean and would laugh at me if i look dirti besid she was go to give me a pair of trouser which i should not put on unless i got all the dirt off me the thought of own a pair of trouser was great inde it was almost a suffici motiv not onli to make me take off what would be call by pig drover the mang but the skin itself i went at it in good earnest work for the first time with the hope of reward the tie that ordinarili bind children to their home were all suspend in my case i found no sever trial in my departur my home was charmless it was not home to me on part from it i could not feel that i was leav ani thing which i could have enjoy by stay my mother was dead my grandmoth live far off so that i seldom saw her i had two sister and one brother that live in the same hous with me but the earli separ of us from our mother had well nigh blot the fact of our relationship from our memori i look for home elsewher and was confid of find none which i should relish less than the one which i was leav if howev i found in my new home hardship hunger whip and naked i had the consol that i should not have escap ani one of them by stay have alreadi had more than a tast of them in the hous of my old master and have endur them there i veri natur infer my abil to endur them elsewher and especi at baltimor for i had someth of the feel about baltimor that is express in the proverb that be hang in england is prefer to die a natur death in ireland i had the strongest desir to see baltimor cousin tom though not fluent in speech had inspir me with that desir by his eloqu descript of the place i could never point out ani thing at the great hous no matter how beauti or power but that he had seen someth at baltimor far exceed both in beauti and strength the object which i point out to him even the great hous itself with all it pictur was far inferior to mani build in baltimor so strong was my desir that i thought a gratif of it would fulli compens for whatev loss of comfort i should sustain by the exchang i left without a regret and with the highest hope of futur happi we sail out of mile river for baltimor on a saturday morn i rememb onli the day of the week for at that time i had no knowledg of the day of the month nor the month of the year on set sail i walk aft and gave to colonel lloyd plantat what i hope would be the last look i then place myself in the bow of the sloop and there spent the remaind of the day in look ahead interest myself in what was in the distanc rather than in thing near by or behind in the afternoon of that day we reach annapoli the capit of the state we stop but a few moment so that i had no time to go on shore it was the first larg town that i had ever seen and though it would look small compar with some of our new england factori villag i thought it a wonder place for it sizemor impos even than the great hous farm we arriv at baltimor earli on sunday morn land at smith wharf not far from bowley wharf we had on board the sloop a larg flock of sheep and after aid in drive them to the slaughterhous of mr curti on louden slater hill i was conduct by rich one of the hand belong on board of the sloop to my new home in alliciana street near mr gardner ship yard on fell point mr and mrs auld were both at home and met me at the door with their littl son thoma to take care of whom i had been given and here i saw what i had never seen befor it was a white face beam with the most kind emot it was the face of my new mistress sophia auld i wish i could describ the raptur that flash through my soul as i beheld it it was a new and strang sight to me brighten up my pathway with the light of happi littl thoma was told there was his freddyand i was told to take care of littl thoma and thus i enter upon the duti of my new home with the most cheer prospect ahead i look upon my departur from colonel lloyd plantat as one of the most interest event of my life it is possibl and even quit probabl that but for the mere circumst of be remov from that plantat to baltimor i should have to day instead of be here seat by my own tabl in the enjoy of freedom and the happi of home write this narrat been confin in the gall chain of slaveri go to live at baltimor laid the foundat and open the gateway to all my subsequ prosper i have ever regard it as the first plain manifest of that kind provid which has ever sinc attend me and mark my life with so mani favor i regard the select of myself as be somewhat remark there were a number of slave children that might have been sent from the plantat to baltimor there were those younger those older and those of the same age i was chosen from among them all and was the first last and onli choic i may be deem superstiti and even egotist in regard this event as a special interposit of divin provid in my favor but i should be fals to the earliest sentiment of my soul if i suppress the opinion i prefer to be true to myself even at the hazard of incur the ridicul of other rather than to be fals and incur my own abhorr from my earliest recollect i date the entertain of a deep convict that slaveri would not alway be abl to hold me within it foul embrac and in the darkest hour of my career in slaveri this live word of faith and spirit of hope depart not from me but remain like minist angel to cheer me through the gloom this good spirit was from god and to him i offer thanksgiv and prais chapter vi my new mistress prove to be all she appear when i first met her at the doora woman of the kindest heart and finest feel she had never had a slave under her control previous to myself and prior to her marriag she had been depend upon her own industri for a live she was by trade a weaver and by constant applic to her busi she had been in a good degre preserv from the blight and dehuman effect of slaveri i was utter astonish at her good i scarc knew how to behav toward her she was entir unlik ani other white woman i had ever seen i could not approach her as i was accustom to approach other white ladi my earli instruct was all out of place the crouch servil usual so accept a qualiti in a slave did not answer when manifest toward her her favor was not gain by it she seem to be disturb by it she did not deem it impud or unmann for a slave to look her in the face the meanest slave was put fulli at eas in her presenc and none left without feel better for have seen her her face was made of heaven smile and her voic of tranquil music but ala this kind heart had but a short time to remain such the fatal poison of irrespons power was alreadi in her hand and soon commenc it infern work that cheer eye under the influenc of slaveri soon becam red with rage that voic made all of sweet accord chang to one of harsh and horrid discord and that angel face gave place to that of a demon veri soon after i went to live with mr and mrs auld she veri kind commenc to teach me the a b c after i had learn this she assist me in learn to spell word of three or four letter just at this point of my progress mr auld found out what was go on and at onc forbad mrs auld to instruct me further tell her among other thing that it was unlaw as well as unsaf to teach a slave to read to use his own word further he said if you give a nigger an inch he will take an ell a nigger should know noth but to obey his masterto do as he is told to do learn would spoil the best nigger in the world now said he if you teach that nigger speak of myself how to read there would be no keep him it would forev unfit him to be a slave he would at onc becom unmanag and of no valu to his master as to himself it could do him no good but a great deal of harm it would make him discont and unhappi these word sank deep into my heart stir up sentiment within that lay slumber and call into exist an entir new train of thought it was a new and special revel explain dark and mysteri thing with which my youth understand had struggl but struggl in vain i now understood what had been to me a most perplex difficultyto wit the white man power to enslav the black man it was a grand achiev and i prize it high from that moment i understood the pathway from slaveri to freedom it was just what i want and i got it at a time when i the least expect it whilst i was sadden by the thought of lose the aid of my kind mistress i was gladden by the invalu instruct which by the merest accid i had gain from my master though conscious of the difficulti of learn without a teacher i set out with high hope and a fix purpos at whatev cost of troubl to learn how to read the veri decid manner with which he spoke and strove to impress his wife with the evil consequ of give me instruct serv to convinc me that he was deepli sensibl of the truth he was utter it gave me the best assur that i might reli with the utmost confid on the result which he said would flow from teach me to read what he most dread that i most desir what he most love that i most hate that which to him was a great evil to be care shun was to me a great good to be dilig sought and the argument which he so warm urg against my learn to read onli serv to inspir me with a desir and determin to learn in learn to read i owe almost as much to the bitter opposit of my master as to the kind aid of my mistress i acknowledg the benefit of both i had resid but a short time in baltimor befor i observ a mark differ in the treatment of slave from that which i had wit in the countri a citi slave is almost a freeman compar with a slave on the plantat he is much better fed and cloth and enjoy privileg altogeth unknown to the slave on the plantat there is a vestig of decenc a sens of shame that doe much to curb and check those outbreak of atroci cruelti so common enact upon the plantat he is a desper slavehold who will shock the human of his non slavehold neighbor with the cri of his lacer slave few are will to incur the odium attach to the reput of be a cruel master and abov all thing they would not be known as not give a slave enough to eat everi citi slavehold is anxious to have it known of him that he feed his slave well and it is due to them to say that most of them do give their slave enough to eat there are howev some pain except to this rule direct opposit to us on philpot street live mr thoma hamilton he own two slave their name were henrietta and mari henrietta was about twenti two year of age mari was about fourteen and of all the mangl and emaci creatur i ever look upon these two were the most so his heart must be harder than stone that could look upon these unmov the head neck and shoulder of mari were liter cut to piec i have frequent felt her head and found it near cover with fester sore caus by the lash of her cruel mistress i do not know that her master ever whip her but i have been an eye wit to the cruelti of mrs hamilton i use to be in mr hamilton hous near everi day mrs hamilton use to sit in a larg chair in the middl of the room with a heavi cowskin alway by her side and scarc an hour pass dure the day but was mark by the blood of one of these slave the girl seldom pass her without her say move faster you black gip at the same time give them a blow with the cowskin over the head or shoulder often draw the blood she would then say take that you black gip continu if you dont move faster ill move you ad to the cruel lash to which these slave were subject they were kept near half starv they seldom knew what it was to eat a full meal i have seen mari contend with the pig for the offal thrown into the street so much was mari kick and cut to piec that she was often call peck than by her name chapter vii i live in master hugh famili about seven year dure this time i succeed in learn to read and write in accomplish this i was compel to resort to various stratagem i had no regular teacher my mistress who had kind commenc to instruct me had in complianc with the advic and direct of her husband not onli ceas to instruct but had set her face against my be instruct by ani one els it is due howev to my mistress to say of her that she did not adopt this cours of treatment immedi she at first lack the deprav indispens to shut me up in mental dark it was at least necessari for her to have some train in the exercis of irrespons power to make her equal to the task of treat me as though i were a brute my mistress was as i have said a kind and tender heart woman and in the simplic of her soul she commenc when i first went to live with her to treat me as she suppos one human be ought to treat anoth in enter upon the duti of a slavehold she did not seem to perceiv that i sustain to her the relat of a mere chattel and that for her to treat me as a human be was not onli wrong but danger so slaveri prove as injuri to her as it did to me when i went there she was a pious warm and tender heart woman there was no sorrow or suffer for which she had not a tear she had bread for the hungri cloth for the nake and comfort for everi mourner that came within her reach slaveri soon prove it abil to divest her of these heaven qualiti under it influenc the tender heart becam stone and the lamblik disposit gave way to one of tiger like fierc the first step in her downward cours was in her ceas to instruct me she now commenc to practis her husband precept she final becam even more violent in her opposit than her husband himself she was not satisfi with simpli do as well as he had command she seem anxious to do better noth seem to make her more angri than to see me with a newspap she seem to think that here lay the danger i have had her rush at me with a face made all up of furi and snatch from me a newspap in a manner that fulli reveal her apprehens she was an apt woman and a littl experi soon demonstr to her satisfact that educ and slaveri were incompat with each other from this time i was most narrowli watch if i was in a separ room ani consider length of time i was sure to be suspect of have a book and was at onc call to give an account of myself all this howev was too late the first step had been taken mistress in teach me the alphabet had given me the inch and no precaut could prevent me from take the ell the plan which i adopt and the one by which i was most success was that of make friend of all the littl white boy whom i met in the street as mani of these as i could i convert into teacher with their kind aid obtain at differ time and in differ place i final succeed in learn to read when i was sent of errand i alway took my book with me and by go one part of my errand quick i found time to get a lesson befor my return i use also to carri bread with me enough of which was alway in the hous and to which i was alway welcom for i was much better off in this regard than mani of the poor white children in our neighborhood this bread i use to bestow upon the hungri littl urchin who in return would give me that more valuabl bread of knowledg i am strong tempt to give the name of two or three of those littl boy as a testimoni of the gratitud and affect i bear them but prudenc forbidsnot that it would injur me but it might embarrass them for it is almost an unpardon offenc to teach slave to read in this christian countri it is enough to say of the dear littl fellow that they live on philpot street veri near durgin and bailey ship yard i use to talk this matter of slaveri over with them i would sometim say to them i wish i could be as free as they would be when they got to be men you will be free as soon as you are twenti one but i am a slave for life have not i as good a right to be free as you have these word use to troubl them they would express for me the liveliest sympathi and consol me with the hope that someth would occur by which i might be free i was now about twelv year old and the thought of be a slave for life began to bear heavili upon my heart just about this time i got hold of a book entitl the columbian orat everi opportun i got i use to read this book among much of other interest matter i found in it a dialogu between a master and his slave the slave was repres as have run away from his master three time the dialogu repres the convers which took place between them when the slave was retaken the third time in this dialogu the whole argument in behalf of slaveri was brought forward by the master all of which was dispos of by the slave the slave was made to say some veri smart as well as impress thing in repli to his masterth which had the desir though unexpect effect for the convers result in the voluntari emancip of the slave on the part of the master in the same book i met with one of sheridan mighti speech on and in behalf of cathol emancip these were choic document to me i read them over and over again with unab interest they gave tongu to interest thought of my own soul which had frequent flash through my mind and die away for want of utter the moral which i gain from the dialogu was the power of truth over the conscienc of even a slavehold what i got from sheridan was a bold denunci of slaveri and a power vindic of human right the read of these document enabl me to utter my thought and to meet the argument brought forward to sustain slaveri but while they reliev me of one difficulti they brought on anoth even more pain than the one of which i was reliev the more i read the more i was led to abhor and detest my enslav i could regard them in no other light than a band of success robber who had left their home and gone to africa and stolen us from our home and in a strang land reduc us to slaveri i loath them as be the meanest as well as the most wick of men as i read and contempl the subject behold that veri discontent which master hugh had predict would follow my learn to read had alreadi come to torment and sting my soul to unutter anguish as i writh under it i would at time feel that learn to read had been a curs rather than a bless it had given me a view of my wretch condit without the remedi it open my eye to the horribl pit but to no ladder upon which to get out in moment of agoni i envi my fellow slave for their stupid i have often wish myself a beast i prefer the condit of the meanest reptil to my own ani thing no matter what to get rid of think it was this everlast think of my condit that torment me there was no get rid of it it was press upon me by everi object within sight or hear anim or inanim the silver trump of freedom had rous my soul to etern wake freedom now appear to disappear no more forev it was heard in everi sound and seen in everi thing it was ever present to torment me with a sens of my wretch condit i saw noth without see it i heard noth without hear it and felt noth without feel it it look from everi star it smile in everi calm breath in everi wind and move in everi storm i often found myself regret my own exist and wish myself dead and but for the hope of be free i have no doubt but that i should have kill myself or done someth for which i should have been kill while in this state of mind i was eager to hear ani one speak of slaveri i was a readi listen everi littl while i could hear someth about the abolitionist it was some time befor i found what the word meant it was alway use in such connect as to make it an interest word to me if a slave ran away and succeed in get clear or if a slave kill his master set fire to a barn or did ani thing veri wrong in the mind of a slavehold it was spoken of as the fruit of abolit hear the word in this connect veri often i set about learn what it meant the dictionari afford me littl or no help i found it was the act of abolish but then i did not know what was to be abolish here i was perplex i did not dare to ask ani one about it mean for i was satisfi that it was someth they want me to know veri littl about after a patient wait i got one of our citi paper contain an account of the number of petit from the north pray for the abolit of slaveri in the district of columbia and of the slave trade between the state from this time i understood the word abolit and abolitionist and alway drew near when that word was spoken expect to hear someth of import to myself and fellow slave the light broke in upon me by degre i went one day down on the wharf of mr water and see two irishmen unload a scow of stone i went unask and help them when we had finish one of them came to me and ask me if i were a slave i told him i was he ask are ye a slave for life i told him that i was the good irishman seem to be deepli affect by the statement he said to the other that it was a piti so fine a littl fellow as myself should be a slave for life he said it was a shame to hold me they both advis me to run away to the north that i should find friend there and that i should be free i pretend not to be interest in what they said and treat them as if i did not understand them for i fear they might be treacher white men have been known to encourag slave to escap and then to get the reward catch them and return them to their master i was afraid that these seem good men might use me so but i nevertheless rememb their advic and from that time i resolv to run away i look forward to a time at which it would be safe for me to escap i was too young to think of do so immedi besid i wish to learn how to write as i might have occas to write my own pass i consol myself with the hope that i should one day find a good chanc meanwhil i would learn to write the idea as to how i might learn to write was suggest to me by be in durgin and bailey ship yard and frequent see the ship carpent after hew and get a piec of timber readi for use write on the timber the name of that part of the ship for which it was intend when a piec of timber was intend for the larboard side it would be mark thusl when a piec was for the starboard side it would be mark thuss a piec for the larboard side forward would be mark thusl f when a piec was for starboard side forward it would be mark thuss f for larboard aft it would be mark thusl a for starboard aft it would be mark thuss a i soon learn the name of these letter and for what they were intend when place upon a piec of timber in the ship yard i immedi commenc copi them and in a short time was abl to make the four letter name after that when i met with ani boy who i knew could write i would tell him i could write as well as he the next word would be i dont believ you let me see you tri it i would then make the letter which i had been so fortun as to learn and ask him to beat that in this way i got a good mani lesson in write which it is quit possibl i should never have gotten in ani other way dure this time my copi book was the board fenc brick wall and pavement my pen and ink was a lump of chalk with these i learn main how to write i then commenc and continu copi the ital in webster spell book until i could make them all without look on the book by this time my littl master thoma had gone to school and learn how to write and had written over a number of copi book these had been brought home and shown to some of our near neighbor and then laid asid my mistress use to go to class meet at the wilk street meetinghous everi monday afternoon and leav me to take care of the hous when left thus i use to spend the time in write in the space left in master thomass copi book copi what he had written i continu to do this until i could write a hand veri similar to that of master thoma thus after a long tedious effort for year i final succeed in learn how to write chapter viii in a veri short time after i went to live at baltimor my old master youngest son richard die and in about three year and six month after his death my old master captain anthoni die leav onli his son andrew and daughter lucretia to share his estat he die while on a visit to see his daughter at hillsborough cut off thus unexpect he left no will as to the dispos of his properti it was therefor necessari to have a valuat of the properti that it might be equal divid between mrs lucretia and master andrew i was immedi sent for to be valu with the other properti here again my feel rose up in detest of slaveri i had now a new concept of my degrad condit prior to this i had becom if not insens to my lot at least part so i left baltimor with a young heart overborn with sad and a soul full of apprehens i took passag with captain row in the schooner wild cat and after a sail of about twenti four hour i found myself

himself and master hugh and as a mean of punish his brother he took me from him to live with himself at st michael here i underw anoth most pain separ it howev was not so sever as the one i dread at the divis of properti for dure this interv a great chang had taken place in master hugh and his onc kind and affection wife the influenc of brandi upon him and of slaveri upon her had effect a disastr chang in the charact of both so that as far as they were concern i thought i had littl to lose by the chang but it was not to them that i was attach it was to those littl baltimor boy that i felt the strongest attach i had receiv mani good lesson from them and was still receiv them and the thought of leav them was pain inde i was leav too without the hope of ever be allow to return master thoma had said he would never let me return again the barrier betwixt himself and brother he consid impass i then had to regret that i did not at least make the attempt to carri out my resolut to run away for the chanc of success are tenfold greater from the citi than from the countri i sail from baltimor for st michael in the sloop amanda captain edward dodson on my passag i paid particular attent to the direct which the steamboat took to go to philadelphia i found instead of go down on reach north point they went up the bay in a north easter direct i deem this knowledg of the utmost import my determin to run away was again reviv i resolv to wait onli so long as the offer of a favor opportun when that came i was determin to be off chapter ix i have now reach a period of my life when i can give date i left baltimor and went to live with master thoma auld at st michael in march 1832 it was now more than seven year sinc i live with him in the famili of my old master on colonel lloyd plantat we of cours were now almost entir stranger to each other he was to me a new master and i to him a new slave i was ignor of his temper and disposit he was equal so of mine a veri short time howev brought us into full acquaint with each other i was made acquaint with his wife not less than with himself they were well match be equal mean and cruel i was now for the first time dure a space of more than seven year made to feel the pain gnaw of hungera someth which i had not experienc befor sinc i left colonel lloyd plantat it went hard enough with me then when i could look back to no period at which i had enjoy a suffici it was tenfold harder after live in master hugh famili where i had alway had enough to eat and of that which was good i have said master thoma was a mean man he was so not to give a slave enough to eat is regard as the most aggrav develop of mean even among slavehold the rule is no matter how coars the food onli let there be enough of it this is the theori and in the part of maryland from which i came it is the general practicethough there are mani except master thoma gave us enough of neither coars nor fine food there were four slave of us in the kitchenmi sister eliza my aunt priscilla henni and myself and we were allow less than a half of a bushel of corn meal per week and veri littl els either in the shape of meat or veget it was not enough for us to subsist upon we were therefor reduc to the wretch necess of live at the expens of our neighbor this we did by beg and steal whichev came handi in the time of need the one be consid as legitim as the other a great mani time have we poor creatur been near perish with hunger when food in abund lay moulder in the safe and smoke hous and our pious mistress was awar of the fact and yet that mistress and her husband would kneel everi morn and pray that god would bless them in basket and store bad as all slavehold are we seldom meet one destitut of everi element of charact command respect my master was one of this rare sort i do not know of one singl nobl act ever perform by him the lead trait in his charact was mean and if there were ani other element in his natur it was made subject to this he was mean and like most other mean men he lack the abil to conceal his mean captain auld was not born a slavehold he had been a poor man master onli of a bay craft he came into possess of all his slave by marriag and of all men adopt slavehold are the worst he was cruel but coward he command without firm in the enforc of his rule he was at time rigid and at time lax at time he spoke to his slave with the firm of napoleon and the furi of a demon at other time he might well be mistaken for an inquir who had lost his way he did noth of himself he might have pass for a lion but for his ear in all thing nobl which he attempt his own mean shone most conspicu his air word and action were the air word and action of born slavehold and be assum were awkward enough he was not even a good imit he possess all the disposit to deceiv but want the power have no resourc within himself he was compel to be the copyist of mani and be such he was forev the victim of inconsist and of consequ he was an object of contempt and was held as such even by his slave the luxuri of have slave of his own to wait upon him was someth new and unprepar for he was a slavehold without the abil to hold slave he found himself incap of manag his slave either by forc fear or fraud we seldom call him master we general call him captain auld and were hard dispos to titl him at all i doubt not that our conduct had much to do with make him appear awkward and of consequ fret our want of rever for him must have perplex him great he wish to have us call him master but lack the firm necessari to command us to do so his wife use to insist upon our call him so but to no purpos in august 1832 my master attend a methodist camp meet held in the bay side talbot counti and there experienc religion i indulg a faint hope that his convers would lead him to emancip his slave and that if he did not do this it would at ani rate make him more kind and human i was disappoint in both these respect it neither made him to be human to his slave nor to emancip them if it had ani effect on his charact it made him more cruel and hate in all his way for i believ him to have been a much wors man after his convers than befor prior to his convers he reli upon his own deprav to shield and sustain him in his savag barbar but after his convers he found religi sanction and support for his slavehold cruelti he made the greatest pretens to pieti his hous was the hous of prayer he pray morn noon and night he veri soon distinguish himself among his brethren and was soon made a class leader and exhort his activ in reviv was great and he prove himself an instrument in the hand of the church in convert mani soul his hous was the preacher home they use to take great pleasur in come there to put up for while he starv us he stuf them we have had three or four preacher there at a time the name of those who use to come most frequent while i live there were mr stork mr eweri mr humphri and mr hickey i have also seen mr georg cookman at our hous we slave love mr cookman we believ him to be a good man we thought him instrument in get mr samuel harrison a veri rich slavehold to emancip his slave and by some mean got the impress that he was labor to effect the emancip of all the slave when he was at our hous we were sure to be call in to prayer when the other were there we were sometim call in and sometim not mr cookman took more notic of us than either of the other minist he could not come among us without betray his sympathi for us and stupid as we were we had the sagac to see it while i live with my master in st michael there was a white young man a mr wilson who propos to keep a sabbath school for the instruct of such slave as might be dispos to learn to read the new testament we met but three time when mr west and mr fairbank both class leader with mani other came upon us with stick and other missil drove us off and forbad us to meet again thus end our littl sabbath school in the pious town of st michael i have said my master found religi sanction for his cruelti as an exampl i will state one of mani fact go to prove the charg i have seen him tie up a lame young woman and whip her with a heavi cowskin upon her nake shoulder caus the warm red blood to drip and in justif of the bloodi deed he would quot this passag of scriptureh that knoweth his master will and doeth it not shall be beaten with mani stripe master would keep this lacer young woman tie up in this horrid situat four or five hour at a time i have known him to tie her up earli in the morn and whip her befor breakfast leav her go to his store return at dinner and whip her again cut her in the place alreadi made raw with his cruel lash the secret of master cruelti toward henni is found in the fact of her be almost helpless when quit a child she fell into the fire and burn herself horribl her hand were so burnt that she never got the use of them she could do veri littl but bear heavi burden she was to master a bill of expens and as he was a mean man she was a constant offenc to him he seem desir of get the poor girl out of exist he gave her away onc to his sister but be a poor gift she was not dispos to keep her final my benevol master to use his own word set her adrift to take care of herself here was a recent convert man hold on upon the mother and at the same time turn out her helpless child to starv and die master thoma was one of the mani pious slavehold who hold slave for the veri charit purpos of take care of them my master and myself had quit a number of differ he found me unsuit to his purpos my citi life he said had had a veri pernici effect upon me it had almost ruin me for everi good purpos and fit me for everi thing which was bad one of my greatest fault was that of let his hors run away and go down to his father inlaw farm which was about five mile from st michael i would then have to go after it my reason for this kind of careless or care was that i could alway get someth to eat when i went there master william hamilton my master father in law alway gave his slave enough to eat i never left there hungri no matter how great the need of my speedi return master thoma at length said he would stand it no longer i had live with him nine month dure which time he had given me a number of sever whip all to no good purpos he resolv to put me out as he said to be broken and for this purpos he let me for one year to a man name edward covey mr covey was a poor man a farm renter he rent the place upon which he live as also the hand with which he till it mr covey had acquir a veri high reput for break young slave and this reput was of immens valu to him it enabl him to get his farm till with much less expens to himself than he could have had it done without such a reput some slavehold thought it not much loss to allow mr covey to have their slave one year for the sake of the train to which they were subject without ani other compens he could hire young help with great eas in consequ of this reput ad to the natur good qualiti of mr covey he was a professor of religiona pious soula member and a class leader in the methodist church all of this ad weight to his reput as a nigger breaker i was awar of all the fact have been made acquaint with them by a young man who had live there i nevertheless made the chang glad for i was sure of get enough to eat which is not the smallest consider to a hungri man chapter x i had left master thomass hous and went to live with mr covey on the 1st of januari 1833 i was now for the first time in my life a

caus the blood to run and rais ridg on my flesh as larg as my littl finger the detail of this affair are as follow mr covey sent me veri earli in the morn of one of our coldest day in the month of januari to the wood to get a load of wood he gave me a team of unbroken oxen he told me which was the in hand ox and which the off hand one he then tie the end of a larg rope around the horn of the in hand ox and gave me the other end of it and told me if the oxen start to run that i must hold on upon the rope i had never driven oxen befor and of cours i was veri awkward i howev succeed in get to the edg of the wood with littl difficulti but i had got a veri few rod into the wood when the oxen took fright and start full tilt carri the cart against tree and over stump in the most fright manner i expect everi moment that my brain would be dash out against the tree after run thus for a consider distanc they final upset the cart dash it with great forc against a tree and threw themselv into a dens thicket how i escap death i do not know there i was entir alon in a thick wood in a place new to me my cart was upset and shatter my oxen were entangl among the young tree and there was none to help me after a long spell of effort i succeed in get my cart right my oxen disentangl and again yoke to the cart i now proceed with my team to the place where i had the day befor been chop wood and load my cart pretti heavili think in this way to tame my oxen i then proceed on my way home i had now consum one half of the day i got out of the wood safe and now felt out of danger i stop my oxen to open the wood gate and just as i did so befor i could get hold of my ox rope the oxen again start rush through the gate catch it between the wheel and the bodi of the cart tear it to piec and come within a few inch of crush me against the gate post thus twice in one short day i escap death by the merest chanc on my return i told mr covey what had happen and how it happen he order me to return to the wood again immedi i did so and he follow on after me just as i got into the wood he came up and told me to stop my cart and that he would teach me how to trifl away my time and break gate he then went to a larg gum tree and with his axe cut three larg switch and after trim them up neat with his pocketknif he order me to take off my cloth i made him no answer but stood with my cloth on he repeat his order i still made him no answer nor did i move to strip myself upon this he rush at me with the fierc of a tiger tore off my cloth and lash me till he had worn out his switch cut me so savag as to leav the mark visibl for a long time after this whip was the first of a number just like it and for similar offenc i live with mr covey one year dure the first six month of that year scarc a week pass without his whip me i was seldom free from a sore back my awkward was almost alway his excus for whip me we were work fulli up to the point of endur long befor day we were up our hors fed and by the first approach of day we were off to the field with our hoe and plough team mr covey gave us enough to eat but scarc time to eat it we were often less than five minut take our meal we were often in the field from the first approach of day till it last linger ray had left us and at save fodder time midnight often caught us in the field bind blade covey would be out with us the way he use to stand it was this he would spend the most of his afternoon in bed he would then come out fresh in the even readi to urg us on with his word exampl and frequent with the whip mr covey was one of the few slavehold who could and did work with his hand he was a hard work man he knew by himself just what a man or a boy could do there was no deceiv him his work went on in his absenc almost as well as in his presenc and he had the faculti of make us feel that he was ever present with us this he did by surpris us he seldom approach the spot where we were at work open if he could do it secret he alway aim at take us by surpris such was his cun that we use to call him among ourselv the snake when we were at work in the cornfield he would sometim crawl on his hand and knee to avoid detect and all at onc he would rise near in our midst and scream out ha ha come come dash on dash on this be his mode of attack it was never safe to stop a singl minut his come were like a thief in the night he appear to us as be ever at hand he was under everi tree behind everi stump in everi bush and at everi window on the plantat he would sometim mount his hors as if bound to st michael a distanc of seven mile and in half an hour afterward you would see him coil up in the corner of the wood fenc watch everi motion of the slave he would for this purpos leav his hors tie up in the wood again he would sometim walk up to us and give us order as though he was upon the point of start on a long journey turn his back upon us and make as though he was go to the hous to get readi and befor he would get half way thither he would turn short and crawl into a fenc corner or behind some tree and there watch us till the go down of the sun mr covey fort consist in his power to deceiv his life was devot to plan and perpetr the grossest decept everi thing he possess in the shape of learn or religion he made conform to his disposit to deceiv he seem to think himself equal to deceiv the almighti he would make a short prayer in the morn and a long prayer at night and strang as it may seem few men would at time appear more devot than he the exercis of his famili devot were alway commenc with sing and as he was a veri poor singer himself the duti of rais the hymn general came upon me he would read his hymn and nod at me to commenc i would at time do so at other i would not my non complianc would almost alway produc much confus to show himself independ of me he would start and stagger through with his hymn in the most discord manner in this state of mind he pray with more than ordinari spirit poor man such was his disposit and success at deceiv i do verili believ that he sometim deceiv himself into the solemn belief that he was a sincer worshipp of the most high god and this too at a time when he may be said to have been guilti of compel his woman slave to commit the sin of adulteri the fact in the case are these mr covey was a poor man he was just commenc in life he was onli abl to buy one slave and shock as is the fact he bought her as he said for a breeder this woman was name carolin mr covey bought her from mr thoma low about six mile from st michael she was a larg abl bodi woman about twenti year old she had alreadi given birth to one child which prove her to be just what he want after buy her he hire a marri man of mr samuel harrison to live with him one year and him he use to fasten up with her everi night the result was that at the end of the year the miser woman gave birth to twin at this result mr covey seem to be high pleas both with the man and the wretch woman such was his joy and that of his wife that noth they could do for carolin dure her confin was too good or too hard to be done the children were regard as be quit an addit to his wealth if at ani one time of my life more than anoth i was made to drink the bitterest dreg of slaveri that time was dure the first six month of my stay with mr covey we were work in all weather it was never too hot or too cold it could never rain blow hail or snow too hard for us to work in the field work work work was scarc more the order of the day than of the night the longest day were too short for him and

reconcil myself to my wretch lot i have alreadi intim that my condit was much wors dure the first six month of my stay at mr covey than in the last six the circumst lead to the chang in mr covey cours toward me form an epoch in my humbl histori you have seen how a man was made a slave you shall see how a slave was made a man on one of the hottest day of the month of august 1833 bill smith william hugh a slave name eli and myself were engag in fan wheat hugh was clear the fan wheat from befor the fan eli was turn smith was feed and i was carri wheat to the fan the work was simpl requir strength rather than intellect yet to one entir unus to such work it came veri hard about three oclock of that day i broke down my strength fail me i was seiz with a violent ach of the head attend with extrem dizzi i trembl in everi limb find what was come i nerv myself up feel it would never do to stop work i stood as long as i could stagger to the hopper with grain when i could stand no longer i fell and felt as if held down by an immens weight the fan of cours stop everi one had his own work to do and no one could do the work of the other and have his own go on at the same time mr covey was at the hous about one hundr yard from the tread yard where we were fan on hear the fan stop he left immedi and came to the spot where we were he hastili inquir what the matter was bill answer that i was sick and there was no one to bring wheat to the fan i had by this time crawl away under the side of the post and rail fenc by which the yard was enclos hope to find relief by get out of the sun he then ask where i was he was told by one of the hand he came to the spot and after look at me awhil ask me what was the matter i told him as well as i could for i scarc had strength to speak he then gave me a savag kick in the side and told me to get up i tri to do so but fell back in the attempt he gave me anoth kick and again told me to rise i again tri and succeed in gain my feet but stoop to get the tub with which i was feed the fan i again stagger and fell while down in this situat mr covey took up the hickori slat with which hugh had been strike off the half bushel measur and with it gave me a heavi blow upon the head make a larg wound and the blood ran freeli and with this again told me to get up i made no effort to compli have now made up my mind to let him do his worst in a short time after receiv this blow my head grew better mr covey had now left me to my fate at this moment i resolv for the first time to go to my master enter a complaint and ask his protect in order to do this i must that afternoon walk seven mile and this under the circumst was truli a sever undertak i was exceed feebl made so as much by the kick and blow which i receiv as by the sever fit of sick to which i had been subject i howev watch my chanc while covey was look in an opposit direct and start for st michael i succeed in get a consider distanc on my way to the wood when covey discov me and call after me to come back threaten what he would do if i did not come i disregard both his call and his threat and made my way to the wood as fast as my feebl state would allow and think i might be overhaul by him if i kept the road i walk through the wood keep far enough from the road to avoid detect and near enough to prevent lose my way i had not gone far befor my littl strength again fail me i could go no farther i fell down and lay for a consider time the blood was yet ooz from the wound on my head for a time i thought i should bleed to death and think now that i should have done so but that the blood so mat my hair as to stop the wound after lie there about three quarter of an hour i nerv myself up again and start on my way through bog and brier barefoot and barehead tear my feet sometim at near everi step and after a journey of about seven mile occupi some five hour to perform it i arriv at master store i then present an appear enough to affect ani but a heart of iron from the crown of my head to my feet i was cover with blood my hair was all clot with dust and blood my shirt was stiff with blood i suppos i look like a man who had escap a den of wild beast and bare escap them in this state i appear befor my master humbl entreat him to interpos his author for my protect i told him all the circumst as well as i could and it seem as i spoke at time to affect him he would then walk the floor and seek to justifi covey by say he expect i deserv it he ask me what i want i told him to let me get a new home that as sure as i live with mr covey again i should live with but to die with him that covey would sure kill me he was in a fair way for it master thoma ridicul the idea that there was ani danger of mr covey kill me and said that he knew mr covey that he was a good man and that he could not think of take me from him that should he do so he would lose the whole year wage that i belong to mr covey for one year and that i must go back to him come what might and that i must not troubl him with ani more stori or that he would himself get hold of me after threaten me thus he gave me a veri larg dose of salt tell me that i might remain in st michael that night it be quit late but that i must be off back to mr covey earli in the morn and that if i did not he would get hold of me which meant that he would whip me i remain all night and accord to his order i start off to covey in the morn saturday morn weari in bodi and broken in spirit i got no supper that night or breakfast that morn i reach covey about nine oclock and just as i was get over the fenc that divid mrs kemp field from our out ran covey with his cowskin to give me anoth whip befor he could reach me i succeed in get to the cornfield and as the corn was veri high it afford me the mean of hide he seem veri angri and search for me a long time my behavior was altogeth unaccount he final gave up the chase think i suppos that i must come home for someth to eat he would give himself no further troubl in look for me i spent that day most in the wood have the altern befor meto go home and be whip to death or stay in the wood and be starv to death that night i fell in with sandi jenkin a slave with whom i was somewhat acquaint sandi had a free wife who live about four mile from mr covey and it be saturday he was on his way to see her i told him my circumst and he veri kind invit me to go home with him i went home with him and talk this whole matter over and got his advic as to what cours it was best for me to pursu i found sandi an old advis he told me with great solemn i must go back to covey but that befor i went i must go with him into anoth part of the wood where there was a certain root which if i would take some of it with me carri it alway on my right side would render it imposs for mr covey or ani other white man to whip me he said he had carri it for year and sinc he had done so he had never receiv a blow and never expect to while he carri it i at first reject the idea that the simpl carri of a root in my pocket would have ani such effect as he had said and was not dispos to take it but sandi impress the necess with much earnest tell me it could do no harm if it did no good to pleas him i at length took the root and accord to his direct carri it upon my right side this was sunday morn i immedi start for home and upon enter the yard gate out came mr covey on his way to meet he spoke to me veri kind bade me drive the pig from a lot near by and pass on toward the church now this singular conduct of mr covey realli made me begin to think that there was someth in the root which sandi had given me and had it been on ani other day than sunday i could have attribut the conduct to no other caus than the influenc of that root and as it was i was half inclin to think the root to be someth more than i at first had taken it to be all went well till monday morn on this morn the virtu of the root was fulli test long befor daylight i was call to go and rub curri and feed the hors i obey and was glad to obey but whilst thus engag whilst in the act of throw down some blade from the loft mr covey enter the stabl with a long rope and just as i was half out of the loft he caught hold of my leg and was about tie me as soon as i found what he was up to i gave a sudden spring and as i did so he hold to my leg i was brought sprawl on the stabl floor mr covey seem now to think he had me and could do what he pleas but at this momentfrom whenc came the spirit i dont knowi resolv to fight and suit my action to the resolut i seiz covey hard by the throat and as i did so i rose he held on to me and i to him my resist was so entir unexpect that covey seem taken all aback he trembl like a leaf this gave me assur and i held him uneasi caus the blood to run where i touch him with the end of my finger mr covey soon call out to hugh for help hugh came and while covey held me attempt to tie my right hand while he was in the act of do so i watch my chanc and gave him a heavi kick close under the rib this kick fair sicken hugh so that he left me in the hand of mr covey this kick had the effect of not onli weaken hugh but covey also when he saw hugh bend over with pain his courag quail he ask me if i meant to persist in my resist i told him i did come what might that he had use me like a brute for six month and that i was determin to be use so no longer with that he strove to drag me to a stick that was lie just out of the stabl door he meant to knock me down but just as he was lean over to get the stick i seiz him with both hand by his collar and brought him by a sudden snatch to the ground by this time bill came covey call upon him for assist bill want to know what he could do covey said take hold of him take hold of him bill said his master hire him out to work and not to help to whip me so he left covey and myself to fight our own battl out we were at it for near two hour covey at length let me go puf and blow at a great rate say that if i had not resist he would not have whip me half so much the truth was that he had not whip me at all i consid him as get entir the worst end of the bargain for he had drawn no blood from me but i had from him the whole six month afterward that i spent with mr covey he never laid the weight of his finger upon me in anger he would occasion say he didnt want to get hold of me again no thought i you need not for you will come off wors than you did befor this battl with mr covey was the turn point in my career as a slave it rekindl the few expir ember of freedom and reviv within me a sens of my own manhood it recal the depart self confid and inspir me again with a determin to be free the gratif afford by the triumph was a full compens for whatev els might follow even death itself he onli can understand the deep satisfact which i experienc who has himself repel by forc the bloodi arm of slaveri i felt as i never felt befor it was a glorious resurrect from the tomb of slaveri to the heaven of freedom my long crush spirit rose cowardic depart bold defianc took it place and i now resolv that howev long i might remain a slave in form the day had pass forev when i could be a slave in fact i did not hesit to let it be known of me that the white man who expect to succeed in whip must also succeed in kill me from this time i was never again what might be call fair whip though i remain a slave four year afterward i had sever fight but was never whip it was for a long time a matter of surpris to me whi mr covey did not immedi have me taken by the constabl to the whip post and there regular whip for the crime of rais my hand against a white man in defenc of myself and the onli explan i can now think of doe not entir satisfi me but such as it is i will give it mr covey enjoy the most unbound reput for be a first rate overs and negro breaker it was of consider import to him that reput was at stake and had he sent mea boy about sixteen year oldto the public whip post his reput would have been lost so to save his reput he suffer me to go unpunish my term of actual servic to mr edward covey end on christma day 1833 the day between christma and new year day are allow as holiday and accord we were not requir to perform ani labor more than to feed and take care of the stock this time we regard as our own by the grace of our master and we therefor use or abus it near as we pleas those of us who had famili at a distanc were general allow to spend the whole six day in their societi this time howev was spent in various way the staid sober think and industri one of our number would employ themselv in make corn broom mat hors collar and basket and anoth class of us would spend the time in hunt opossum hare and coon but by far the larger part engag in such sport and merriment as play ball wrestl run foot race fiddl danc and drink whiski and this latter mode of spend the time was by far the most agreeabl to the feel of our master a slave who would work dure the holiday was consid by our master as scarc deserv them he was regard as one who reject the favor of his master it was deem a disgrac not to get drunk at christma and he was regard as lazi inde who had not provid himself with the necessari mean dure the year to get whiski enough to last him through christma from what i know of the effect of these holiday upon the slave i believ them to be among the most effect mean in the hand of the slavehold in keep down the spirit of insurrect were the slavehold at onc to abandon this practic i have not the slightest doubt it would lead to an immedi insurrect among the slave these holiday serv as conductor or safeti valv to carri off the rebelli spirit of enslav human but for these the slave would be forc up to the wildest desper and woe betid the slavehold the day he ventur to remov or hinder the oper of those conductor i warn him that in such an event a spirit will go forth in their midst more to be dread than the most appal earthquak the holiday are part and parcel of the gross fraud wrong and inhuman of slaveri they are profess a custom establish by the benevol of the slavehold but i undertak to say it is the result of selfish and one of the grossest fraud commit upon the down trodden slave they do not give the slave this time becaus they would not like to have their work dure it continu but becaus they know it would be unsaf to depriv them of it this will be seen by the fact that the slavehold like to have their slave spend those day just in such a manner as to make them as glad of their end as of their begin their object seem to be to disgust their slave with freedom by plung them into the lowest depth of dissip for instanc the slavehold not onli like to see the slave drink of his own accord but will adopt various plan to make him drunk one plan is to make bet on their slave as to who can drink the most whiski without get drunk and in this way they succeed in get whole multitud to drink to excess thus when the slave ask for virtuous freedom the cun slavehold know his ignor cheat him with a dose of vicious dissip art label with the name of liberti the most of us use to drink it down and the result was just what might be suppos mani of us were led to think that there was littl to choos between liberti and slaveri we felt and veri proper too that we had almost as well be slave to man as to rum so when the holiday end we stagger up from the filth of our wallow took a long breath and march to the fieldfeel upon the whole rather glad to go from what our master had deceiv us into a belief was freedom back to the arm of slaveri i have said that this mode of treatment is a part of the whole system of fraud and inhuman of slaveri it is so the mode here adopt to disgust the slave with freedom by allow him to see onli the abus of it is carri out in other thing for instanc a slave love molass he steal some his master in mani case goe off to town and buy a larg quantiti he return take his whip and command the slave to eat the molass until the poor fellow is made sick at the veri mention of it the same mode is sometim adopt to make the slave refrain from ask for more food than their regular allow a slave run through his allow and appli for more his master is enrag at him but not will to send him off without food give him more than is necessari and compel him to eat it within a given time then if he complain that he cannot eat it he is said to be satisfi neither full nor fast and is whip for be hard to pleas i have an abund of such illustr of the same principl drawn from my own observ but think the case i have cite suffici the practic is a veri common one on the first of januari 1834 i left mr covey and went to live with mr william freeland who live about three mile from st michael i soon found mr freeland a veri differ man from mr covey though not rich he was what would be call an educ southern gentleman mr covey as i have shown was a well train negro breaker and slave driver the former slavehold though he was seem to possess some regard for honor some rever for justic and some respect for human the latter seem total insens to all such sentiment mr freeland had mani of the fault peculiar to slavehold such as be veri passion and fret but i must do him the justic to say that he was exceed free from those degrad vice to which mr covey was constant addict the one was open and frank and we alway knew where to find him the other was a most art deceiv and could be understood onli by such as were skil enough to detect his cun devis fraud anoth advantag i gain in my new master was he made no pretens to or profess of religion and this in my opinion was truli a great advantag i assert most unhesit that the religion of the south is a mere cover for the most horrid crimesa justifi of the most appal barbaritya sanctifi of the most hate fraudsand a dark shelter under which the darkest foulest grossest and most infern deed of slavehold find the strongest protect were i to be again reduc to the chain of slaveri next to that enslav i should regard be the slave of a religi master the greatest calam that could befal me for of all slavehold with whom i have ever met religi slavehold are the worst i have ever found them the meanest and basest the most cruel and coward of all other it was my unhappi lot not onli to belong to a religi slavehold but to live in a communiti of such religionist veri near mr freeland live the rev daniel weeden and in the same neighborhood live the rev rigbi hopkin these were member and minist in the reform methodist church mr weeden own among other a woman slave whose name i have forgotten this woman back for week was kept liter raw made so by the lash of this merciless religi wretch he use to hire hand his maxim was behav well or behav ill it is the duti of a master occasion to whip a slave to remind him of his master author such was his theori and such his practic mr hopkin was even wors than mr weeden his chief boast was his abil to manag slave the peculiar featur of his govern was that of whip slave in advanc of deserv it he alway manag to have one or more of his slave to whip everi monday morn he did this to alarm their fear and strike terror into those who escap his plan was to whip for the smallest offenc to prevent the commiss of larg one mr hopkin could alway find some excus for whip a slave it would astonish one unaccustom to a slavehold life to see with what wonder eas a slavehold can find thing of which to make occas to whip a slave a mere look word or motiona mistak accid or want of powerar all matter for which a slave may be whip at ani time doe a slave look dissatisfi it is said he has the devil in him and it must be whip out doe he speak loud when spoken to by his master then he is get high mind and should be taken down a button hole lower doe he forget to pull off his hat at the approach of a white person then he is want in rever and should be whip for it doe he ever ventur to vindic his conduct when censur for it then he is guilti of impudenceon of the greatest crime of which a slave can be guilti doe he ever ventur to suggest a differ mode of do thing from that point out by his master he is inde presumptu and get abov himself and noth less than a flog will do for him doe he while plough break a ploughor while hoe break a hoe it is owe to his careless and for it a slave must alway be whip mr hopkin could alway find someth of this sort to justifi the use of the lash and he seldom fail to embrac such opportun there was not a man in the whole counti with whom the slave who had the get their own home would not prefer to live rather than with this rev mr hopkin and yet there was not a man ani where round who made higher profess of religion or was more activ in revivalsmor attent to the class love feast prayer and preach meet or more devot in his familythat pray earlier later louder and longerthan this same reverend slave driver rigbi hopkin but to return to mr freeland and to my experi while in his employ he like mr covey gave us enough to eat but unlik mr covey he also gave us suffici time to take our meal he work us hard but alway between sunris and sunset he requir a good deal of work to be done but gave us good tool with which to work his farm was larg but he employ hand enough to work it and with eas compar with mani of his neighbor my treatment while in his employ was heaven compar with what i experienc at the hand of mr edward covey mr freeland was himself the owner of but two slave their name were henri harri and john harri the rest of his hand he hire these consist of myself sandi jenkin and handi caldwel this is the same man who gave me the root to prevent my be whip by mr covey he was a clever soul we use frequent to talk about the fight with covey and as often as we did so he would claim my success as the result of the root which he gave me this superstit is veri common among the more ignor slave a slave seldom die but that his death is attribut to trickeri henri and john were quit intellig and in a veri littl while after i went there i succeed in creat in them a strong desir to learn how to read this desir soon sprang up in the other also they veri soon muster up some old spell book and noth would do but that i must keep a sabbath school i agre to do so and accord devot my sunday to teach these my love fellow slave how to read neither of them knew his letter when i went there some of the slave of the neighbor farm found what was go on and also avail themselv of this littl opportun to learn to read it was understood among all who came that there must be as littl display about it as possibl it was necessari to keep our religi master at st michael unacquaint with the fact that instead of spend the sabbath in wrestl box and drink whiski we were tri to learn how to read the will of god for they had much rather see us engag in those degrad sport than to see us behav like intellectu moral and account be my blood boil as i think of the bloodi manner in which messr wright fairbank and garrison west both class leader in connect with mani other rush in upon us with stick and stone and broke up our virtuous littl sabbath school at st michaelsal call themselv christian humbl follow of the lord jesus christ but i am again digress i held my sabbath school at the hous of a free color man whose name i deem it imprud to mention for should it be known it might embarrass him great though the crime of hold the school was commit ten year ago i had at one time over forti scholar and those of the right sort ardent desir to learn they were of all age though most men and women i look back to those sunday with an amount of pleasur not to be express they were great day to my soul the work of instruct my dear fellow slave was the sweetest engag with which i was ever bless we love each other and to leav them at the close of the sabbath was a sever cross inde when i think that these precious soul are to day shut up in the prison hous of slaveri my feel overcom me and i am almost readi to ask doe a righteous god govern the univers and for what doe he hold the thunder in his right hand if not to smite the oppressor and deliv the spoil out of the hand of the spoiler these dear soul came not to sabbath school becaus it was popular to do so nor did i teach them becaus it was reput to be thus engag everi moment they spent in that school they were liabl to be taken up and given thirti nine lash they came becaus they wish to learn their mind had been starv by their cruel master they had been shut up in mental dark i taught them becaus it was the delight of my soul to be do someth that look like better the condit of my race i kept up my school near the whole year i live with mr freeland and besid my sabbath school i devot three even in the week dure the winter to teach the slave at home and i have the happi to know that sever of those who came to sabbath school learn how to read and that one at least is now free through my agenc the year pass off smooth it seem onli about half as long as the year which preced it i went through it without receiv a singl blow i will give mr freeland the credit of be the best master i ever had till i becam my own master for the eas with which i pass the year i was howev somewhat indebt to the societi of my fellow slave they were nobl soul they not onli possess love heart but brave one we were link and interlink with each other i love them with a love stronger than ani thing i have experienc sinc it is sometim said that we slave do not love and confid in each other in answer to this assert i can say i never love ani or confid in ani peopl more than my fellow slave and especi those with whom i live at mr freeland i believ we would have die for each other we never undertook to do ani thing of ani import without a mutual consult we never move separ we were one and as much so by our temper and disposit as by the mutual hardship to which we were necessarili subject by our condit as slave at the close of the year 1834 mr freeland again hire me of my master for the year 1835 but by this time i began to want to live upon free land as well as with freeland and i was no longer content therefor to live with him or ani other slavehold i began with the commenc of the year to prepar myself for a final struggl which should decid my fate one way or the other my tendenc was upward i was fast approach manhood and year after year had pass and i was still a slave these thought rous mei must do someth i therefor resolv that 1835 should not pass without wit an attempt on my part to secur my liberti but i was not will to cherish this determin alon my fellow slave were dear to me i was anxious to have them particip with me in this my life give determin i therefor though with great prudenc commenc earli to ascertain their view and feel in regard to their condit and to imbu their mind with thought of freedom i bent myself to devis way and mean for our escap and meanwhil strove on all fit occas to impress them with the gross fraud and inhuman of slaveri i went first to henri next to john then to the other i found in them all warm heart and nobl spirit they were readi to hear and readi to act when a feasibl plan should be propos this was what i want i talk to them of our want of manhood if we submit to our enslav without at least one nobl effort to be free we met often and consult frequent and told our hope and fear recount the difficulti real and imagin which we should be call on to meet at time we were almost dispos to give up and tri to content ourselv with our wretch lot at other we were firm and unbend in our determin to go whenev we suggest ani plan there was shrinkingth odd were fear our path was beset with the greatest obstacl and if we succeed in gain the end of it our right to be free was yet questionablew were yet liabl to be return to bondag we could see no spot this side of the ocean where we could be free we knew noth about canada our knowledg of the north did not extend farther than new york and to go there and be forev harass with the fright liabil of be return to slaverywith the certainti of be treat tenfold wors than beforeth thought was truli a horribl one and one which it was not easi to overcom the case sometim stood thus at everi gate through which we were to pass we saw a watchmanat everi ferri a guardon everi bridg a sentineland in everi wood a patrol we were hem in upon everi side here were the difficulti real or imaginedth good to be sought and the evil to be shun on the one hand there stood slaveri a stern realiti glare fright upon usit robe alreadi crimson with the blood of million and even now feast itself greedili upon our own flesh on the other hand away back in the dim distanc under the flicker light of the north star behind some craggi hill or snow cover mountain stood a doubt freedomhalf frozenbeckon us to come and share it hospit this in itself was sometim enough to stagger us but when we permit ourselv to survey the road we were frequent appal upon either side we saw grim death assum the most horrid shape now it was starvat caus us to eat our own fleshnow we were contend with the wave and were drownednow we were overtaken and torn to piec by the fang of the terribl bloodhound we were stung by scorpion chase by wild beast bitten by snake and final after have near reach the desir spotaft swim river encount wild beast sleep in the wood suffer hunger and nakednessw were overtaken by our pursuer and in our resist we were shot dead upon the spot i say this pictur sometim appal us and made us rather bear those ill we had than fli to other that we knew not of in come to a fix determin to run away we did more than patrick henri when he resolv upon liberti or death with us it was a doubt liberti at most and almost certain death if we fail for my part i should prefer death to hopeless bondag sandi one of our number gave up the notion but still encourag us our compani then consist of henri harri john harri henri bailey charl robert and myself henri bailey was my uncl and belong to my master charl marri my aunt he belong to my master father in law mr william hamilton the plan we final conclud upon was to get a larg cano belong to mr hamilton and upon the saturday night previous to easter holiday paddl direct up the chesapeak bay on our arriv at the head of the bay a distanc of seventi or eighti mile from where we live it was our purpos to turn our cano adrift and follow the guidanc of the north star till we got beyond the limit of maryland our reason for take the water rout was that we were less liabl to be suspect as runaway we hope to be regard as fishermen wherea if we should take the land rout we should be subject to interrupt of almost everi kind ani one have a white face and be so dispos could stop us and subject us to examin the week befor our intend start i wrote sever protect one for each of us as well as i can rememb they were in the follow word to wit this is to certifi that i the undersign have given the bearer my servant full liberti to go to baltimor and

fold our arm sit down and acknowledg ourselv fit onli to be slave this none of us were prepar to acknowledg everi man stood firm and at our last meet we pledg ourselv afresh in the most solemn manner that at the time appoint we would certain start in pursuit of freedom this was in the middl of the week at the end of which we were to be off we went as usual to our sever field of labor but with bosom high agit with thought of our truli hazard undertak we tri to conceal our feel as much as possibl and i think we succeed veri well after a pain wait the saturday morn whose night was to wit our departur came i hail it with joy bring what of sad it might friday night was a sleepless one for me i probabl felt more anxious than the rest becaus i was by common consent at the head of the whole

hope never to again earli in the morn we went as usual to the field we were spread manur and all at onc while thus engag i was overwhelm with an indescrib feel in the ful of which i turn to sandi who

hand i wont said henri in a firm tone indic his readi to meet the consequ of his refus wont you said tom graham the constabl no i wont said henri in a still stronger tone with this two of the constabl pull out their shine pistol and swore by their creator that they would make him cross his hand or kill him each cock his pistol and with finger on the trigger walk up to henri say at the same time if he did not cross his hand they would blow his damn heart out shoot me shoot me said henri you cant kill me but onc shoot shootand be damn i wont be tie this he said in a tone of loud defianc and at the same time with a motion as quick as lightn he with one singl stroke dash the pistol from the hand of each constabl as he did this all hand fell upon him and after beat him some time they final overpow him and got him tie dure the scuffl i manag i know not how to get my pass out and without be discov put it into the fire we were all now tie and just as we were to leav for easton jail betsi freeland mother of william freeland came to the door with her hand full of biscuit and divid them between henri and john she then deliv herself of a speech to the follow effectaddress herself to me she said you devil you yellow devil it was you that put it into the head of henri and john to run away but for you you long leg mulatto devil henri nor john would never have thought of such a thing i made no repli and was immedi hurri off toward st michael just a moment previous to the scuffl with henri mr hamilton suggest the proprieti of make a search for the protect which he had understood frederick had written for himself and the rest but just at the moment he was about carri his propos into effect his aid was need in help to tie henri and the excit attend the scuffl caus them either to forget or to deem it unsaf under the circumst to search so we were not yet convict of the intent to run away when we got about half way to st michael while the constabl have us in charg were look ahead henri inquir of me what he should do with his pass i told him to eat it with his biscuit and own noth and we pass the word around own noth and own noth said we all our confid in each other was unshaken we were resolv to succeed or fail togeth after the calam had befallen us as much as befor we were now prepar for ani thing we were to be drag that morn fifteen mile behind hors and then to be place in the easton jail when we reach st michael we underw a sort of examin we all deni that we ever intend to run away we did this more to bring out the evid against us than from ani hope of get clear of be sold for as i have said we were readi for that the fact was we care but littl where we went so we went togeth our greatest concern was about separ we dread that more than ani thing this side of death we found the evid against us to be the testimoni of one person our master would not tell who it was but we came to a unanim decis among ourselv as to who their inform was we were sent off to the jail at easton when we got there we were deliv up to the sheriff mr joseph graham and by him place in jail henri john and myself were place in one room togethercharl and henri bailey in anoth their object in separ us was to hinder concert we had been in jail scarc twenti minut when a swarm of slave trader and agent for slave trader flock into jail to look at us and to ascertain if we were for sale such a set of be i never saw befor i felt myself surround by so mani fiend from perdit a band of pirat never look more like their father the devil they laugh and grin over us say ah my boy we have got you havent we and after taunt us in various way they one by one went into an examin of us with intent to ascertain our valu they would impud ask us if we would not like to have them for our master we would make them no answer and leav them to find out as best they could then they would curs and swear at us tell us that they could take the devil out of us in a veri littl while if we were onli in their hand while in jail we found ourselv in much more comfort quarter than we expect when we went there we did not get much to eat nor that which was veri good but we had a good clean room from the window of which we could see what was go on in the street which was veri much better than though we had been place in one of the dark damp cell upon the whole we got along veri well so far as the jail and it keeper were concern immedi after the holiday were over contrari to all our expect mr hamilton and mr freeland came up to easton and took charl the two henri and john out of jail and carri them home leav me alon i regard this separ as a final one it caus me more pain than ani thing els in the whole transact i was readi for ani thing rather than separ i suppos that they had consult togeth and had decid that as i was the whole caus of the intent of the other to run away it was hard to make the innoc suffer with the guilti and that they had therefor conclud to take the other home and sell me as a warn to the other that remain it is due to the nobl henri to say he seem almost as reluct at leav the prison as at leav home to come to the prison but we knew we should in all probabl be separ if we were sold and sinc he was in their hand he conclud to go peaceabl home i was now left to my fate i was all alon and within the wall of a stone prison but a few day befor and i was full of hope i expect to have been safe in a land of freedom but now i was cover with gloom sunk down to the utmost despair i thought the possibl of freedom was gone i was kept in this way about one week at the end of which captain auld my master to my surpris and utter astonish came up and took me out with the intent of send me with a gentleman of his acquaint into alabama but from some caus or other he did not send me to alabama but conclud to send me back to baltimor to live again with his brother hugh and to learn a trade thus after an absenc of three year and one month i was onc more permit to return to my old home at baltimor my master sent me away becaus there exist against me a veri great prejudic in the communiti and he fear i might be kill in a few week after i went to baltimor master hugh hire me to mr william gardner an extens ship builder on fell point i was put there to learn how to calk it howev prove a veri unfavor place for the accomplish of this object mr gardner was engag that spring in build two larg man of war brig profess for the mexican govern the vessel were to be launch in the juli of that year and in failur thereof mr gardner was to lose a consider sum so that when i enter all was hurri there was no time to learn ani thing everi man had to do that which he knew how to do in enter the shipyard my order from mr gardner were to do whatev the carpent command me to do this was place me at the beck and call of about seventi five men i was to regard all these as master their word was to be my law my situat was a most tri one at time i

near knock out and i was horribl mangl in other respect the fact in the case were these until a veri littl while after i went there white and black ship carpent work side by side and no one seem to see ani improprieti in it all hand seem to be veri well satisfi mani of the black carpent were freemen thing seem to be go on veri well all at onc the white carpent knock off and said they would not work with free color workmen their reason for this as alleg was that if free color carpent were encourag they would soon take the trade into their own hand and poor white men would be thrown out of employ they therefor felt call upon at onc to put a stop to it and take advantag of mr gardner necess they broke off swear they would work no longer unless he would discharg his black carpent now though this did not extend to me in form it did reach me in fact my fellow apprentic veri soon began to feel it degrad to them to work with me they began to put on air and talk about the nigger take the countri say we all ought to be kill and be encourag by the journeymen they commenc make my condit as hard as they could by hector me around and sometim strike me i of cours kept the vow i made after the fight with mr covey and struck back again regardless of consequ and while i kept them from combin i succeed veri well for i could whip the whole of them take them separ they howev at length combin and came upon me arm with stick stone and heavi handspik one came in front with a half brick there was one at each side of me and one behind me while i was attend to those in front and on either side the one behind ran up with the handspik and struck me a heavi blow upon the head it stun me i fell and with this they all ran upon me and fell to beat me with their fist i let them lay on for a while gather strength in an instant i gave a sudden surg and rose to my hand and knee just as i did that one of their number gave me with his heavi boot a power kick in the left eye my eyebal seem to have burst when they saw my eye close and bad swollen they left me with this i seiz the handspik and for a time pursu them but here the carpent interf and i thought i might as well give it up it was imposs to stand my hand against so mani all this took place in sight of not less than fifti white ship carpent and not one interpos a friend word but some cri kill the damn nigger kill him kill him he struck a white person i found my onli chanc for life was in flight i succeed in get away without an addit blow and bare so for to strike a white man is death by lynch lawand that was the law in mr gardner ship yard nor is there much of ani other out of mr gardner ship yard i went direct home and told the stori of my wrong to master hugh and i am happi to say of him irreligi as he was his conduct was heaven compar with that of his brother thoma under similar circumst he listen attent to my narrat of the circumst lead to the savag outrag and gave mani proof of his strong indign at it the heart of my onc overkind mistress was again melt into piti my puf out eye and blood cover face move her to tear she took a chair by me wash the blood from my face and with a mother tender bound up my head cover the wound eye with a lean piec of fresh beef it was almost compens for my suffer to wit onc more a manifest of kind from this my onc affection old mistress master hugh was veri much enrag he gave express to his feel by pour out curs upon the head of those who did the deed as soon as i got a littl the better of my bruis he took me with him to esquir watson on bond street to see what could be done about the matter mr watson inquir who saw the assault commit master hugh told him it was done in mr gardner ship yard at midday where there were a larg compani of men at work as to that he said the deed was done and there was no question as to who did it his answer was he could do noth in the case unless some white man would come forward and testifi he could issu no warrant on my word if i had been kill in the presenc of a thousand color peopl their testimoni combin would have been insuffici to have arrest one of the murder master hugh for onc was compel to say this state of thing was too bad of cours it was imposs to get ani white man to volunt his testimoni in my behalf and against the white young men even those who may have sympath with me were not prepar to do this it requir a degre of courag unknown to them to do so for just at that time the slightest manifest of human toward a color person was denounc as abolition and that name subject it bearer to fright liabil the watchword of the bloodi mind in that region and in those day were damn the abolitionist and damn the nigger there was noth done and probabl noth would have been done if i had been kill such was and such remain the state of thing in the christian citi of baltimor master hugh find he could get no redress refus to let me go back again to mr gardner he kept me himself and his wife dress my wound till i was again restor to health he then took me into the ship yard of which he was foreman in the employ of mr walter price there i was immedi set to calk and veri soon learn the art of use my mallet and iron in the cours of one year from the time i left mr gardner i was abl to command the highest wage given to the most experienc calker i was now of some import to my master i was bring him from six to seven dollar per week i sometim brought him nine dollar per week my wage were a dollar and a half a day after learn how to calk i sought my own employ made my own contract and collect the money which i earn my pathway becam much more smooth than befor my condit was now much more comfort when i could get no calk to do i did noth dure these leisur time those old notion about freedom would steal over me again when in mr gardner employ i was kept in such a perpetu whirl of excit i could think of noth scarc but my life and in think of my life i almost forgot my liberti i have observ this in my experi of slaverythat whenev my condit was improv instead of it increas my content it onli increas my desir to be free and set me to think of plan to gain my freedom i have found that to make a content slave it is necessari to make a thoughtless one it is necessari to darken his moral and mental vision and as far as possibl to annihil the power of reason he must be abl to detect no inconsist in slaveri he must be made to feel that slaveri is right and he can be brought to that onli when he ceas to be a man i was now get as i have said one dollar and fifti cent per day i contract for it i earn it it was paid to me it was right my own yet upon each return saturday night i was compel to deliv everi cent of that money to master hugh and whi not becaus he earn itnot becaus he had ani hand in earn itnot becaus i owe it to himnor becaus he possess the slightest shadow of a right to it but sole becaus he had the power to compel me to give it up the right of the grim visag pirat upon the high sea is exact the same chapter xi i now come to that part of my life dure which i plan and final succeed in make my escap from slaveri but befor narrat ani of the peculiar circumst i deem it proper to make known my intent not to state all the fact connect with the transact my reason for pursu this cours may be understood from the follow first were i to give a minut statement of all the fact it is not onli possibl but quit probabl that other would therebi be involv in the most embarrass difficulti second such a statement would most undoubt induc greater vigil on the part of slavehold than has exist heretofor among them which would of cours be the mean of guard a door wherebi some dear brother bondman might escap his gall chain i deepli regret the necess that impel me to suppress ani thing of import connect with my experi in slaveri it would afford me great pleasur inde as well as materi add to the interest of my narrat were i at liberti to gratifi a curios which i know exist in the mind of mani by an accur statement of all the fact pertain to my most fortun escap but i must depriv myself of this pleasur and the curious of the gratif which such a statement would afford i would allow myself to suffer under the greatest imput which evil mind men might suggest rather than exculp myself and therebi run the hazard of close the slightest avenu by which a brother slave might clear himself of the chain and fetter of slaveri i have never approv of the veri public manner in which some of our western friend have conduct what they call the underground railroad but which i think by their open declar has been made most emphat the upper ground railroad i honor those good men and women for their nobl dare and applaud them for will subject themselv to bloodi persecut by open avow their particip in the escap of slave i howev can see veri littl good result from such a cours either to themselv or the slave escap while upon the other hand i see and feel assur that those open declar are a posit evil to the slave remain who are seek to escap they do noth toward enlighten the slave whilst they do much toward enlighten the master they stimul him to greater watch and enhanc his power to captur his slave we owe someth to the slave south of the line as well as to those north of it and in aid the latter on their way to freedom we should be care to do noth which would be like to hinder the former from escap from slaveri i would keep the merciless slavehold profound ignor of the mean of flight adopt by the slave i would leav him to imagin himself surround by myriad of invis tormentor ever readi to snatch from his infern grasp his trembl prey let him be left to feel his way in the dark let dark commensur with his crime hover over him and let him feel that at everi step he take in pursuit of the fli bondman he is run the fright risk of have his hot brain dash out by an invis agenc let us render the tyrant no aid let us not hold the light by which he can trace the footprint of our fli brother but enough of this i will now proceed to the statement of those fact connect with my escap for which i am alon respons and for which no one can be made to suffer but myself in the earli part of the year 1838 i becam quit restless i could see no reason whi i should at the end of each week pour the reward of my toil into the purs of my master when i carri to him my week wage he would after count the money look me in the face with a robber like fierc and ask is this all he was satisfi with noth less than the last cent he would howev when i made him six dollar sometim give me six cent to encourag me it had the opposit effect i regard it as a sort of admiss of my right to the whole the fact that he gave me ani part of my wage was proof to my mind that he believ me entitl to the whole of them i alway felt wors for have receiv ani thing for i fear that the give me a few cent would eas his conscienc and make him feel himself to be a pretti honor sort of robber my discont grew upon me i was ever on the look out for mean of escap and find no direct mean i determin to tri to hire my time with a view of get money with which to make my escap in the spring of 1838 when master thoma came to baltimor to purchas his spring good i got an opportun and appli to him to allow me to hire my time he unhesit refus my request and told me this was anoth stratagem by which to escap he told me i could go nowher but that he could get me and that in the event of my run away he should spare no pain in his effort to catch me he exhort me to content myself and be obedi he told me if i would be happi i must lay out no plan for the futur he said if i behav myself proper he would take care of me inde he advis me to complet thoughtless of the futur and taught me to depend sole upon him for happi he seem to see fulli the press necess of set asid my intellectu natur in order to content in slaveri but in spite of him and even in spite of myself i continu to think and to think about the injustic of my enslav and the mean of escap about two month after this i appli to master hugh for the privileg of hire my time he was not acquaint with the fact that i had appli to master thoma and had been refus he too at first seem dispos to refus but after some reflect he grant me the privileg and propos the follow term i was to be allow all my time make all contract with those for whom i work and find my own employ and in return for this liberti i was to pay him three dollar at the end of each week find myself in calk tool and in board and cloth my board was two dollar and a half per week this with the wear and tear of cloth and calk tool made my regular expens about six dollar per week this amount i was compel to make up or relinquish the privileg of hire my time rain or shine work or no work at the end of each week the money must be forthcom or i must give up my privileg this arrang it will be perceiv was decid in my master favor it reliev him of all need of look after me his money was sure he receiv all the benefit of slavehold without it evil while i endur all the evil of a slave and suffer all the care and anxieti of a freeman i found it a hard bargain but hard as it was i thought it better than the old mode of get along it was a step toward freedom to be allow to bear the respons of a freeman and i was determin to hold on upon it i bent myself to the work of make money i was readi to work at night as well as day and by the most untir persever and industri i made enough to meet my expens and lay up a littl money everi week i went on thus from may till august master hugh then refus to allow me to hire my time longer the ground for his refus was a failur on my part one saturday night to pay him for my week time this failur was

number of warmheart friend in baltimorefriend that i love almost as i did my lifeand the thought of be separ from them forev was pain beyond express it is my opinion that thousand would escap from slaveri who now remain but for the strong cord of affect that bind them to their friend the thought of leav my friend was decid the most pain thought with which i had to contend the love of them was my tender point and shook my decis more than all thing els besid the pain of separ the dread and apprehens of a failur exceed what i had experienc at my first attempt the appal defeat i then sustain return to torment me i felt assur that if i fail in this attempt my case would be a hopeless oneit would seal my fate as a slave forev i could not hope to get off with ani thing less than the severest punish and be place beyond the mean of escap it requir no veri vivid imagin to depict the most fright scene through which i should have to pass in case i fail the wretched of slaveri and the blessed

the unarm marin to feel when he is rescu by a friend man of war from the pursuit of a pirat in write to a dear friend immedi after my arriv at new york i said i felt like one who had escap a den of hungri lion this state of mind howev veri soon subsid and i was again seiz with a feel of great insecur and loneli i was yet liabl to be taken back and subject to all the tortur of slaveri this in itself was enough to damp the ardor of my enthusiasm but the loneli overcam me there i was in the midst of thousand and yet a perfect stranger without home and without friend in the midst of thousand of my own brethrenchildren of a common father and yet i dare not to unfold to ani one of them my sad condit i was afraid to speak to ani one for fear of speak to the wrong one and therebi fall into the hand of money love kidnapp whose busi it was to lie in wait for the pant fugit as the feroci beast of the forest lie in wait for their prey the motto which i adopt when i start from slaveri was thistrust no man i saw in everi white man an enemi and in almost everi color man caus for distrust it was a most pain situat and to understand it one must need experi it or imagin himself in similar circumst let him be a fugit slave in a strang landa land given up to be the hunt ground for slaveholderswhos inhabit are legal kidnapperswher he is everi moment subject to the terribl liabil of be

situationth situat in which i was placedthen and not till then will he fulli appreci the hardship of and know how to sympath with the toil worn and whip scar fugit slave thank heaven i remain but a short time in this distress situat i was reliev from it by the human hand of mr david ruggl whose vigil kind and persever i shall never forget i am glad of an opportun to express as far as word can the love and gratitud i bear him mr ruggl is now afflict with blind and is himself in need of the same kind offic which he was onc so forward in the perform of toward other i had been in new york but a few day when mr ruggl sought me out and veri kind took me to his board hous at the corner of church and lespenard street mr ruggl was then veri deepli engag in the memor darg case as well as attend to a number of other fugit slave devis way and mean for their success escap and though watch and hem in on almost everi side he seem to be more than a match for his enemi veri soon after i went to mr ruggl he wish to know of me where i want to go as he deem it unsaf for me to remain in new york i told him i was a calker and should like to go where i could get work i thought of go to canada but he decid against it and in favor of my go to new bedford think i should be abl to get work there at my trade at this time anna my intend wife came on for i wrote to her immedi after my arriv at new york notwithstand my homeless houseless and helpless condit inform her of my success flight and wish her to come on forthwith in a few day after her arriv mr ruggl call in the rev j w c pennington who in the presenc of mr ruggl mrs michael and two or three other perform the marriag ceremoni and gave us a certif of which the follow is an exact copi this may certifi that i join togeth in holi matrimoni frederick johnson and anna murray as man and wife in the presenc of mr david ruggl and mrs michael jame w c pennington new york sept 15 1838 she was free i had chang my name from frederick bailey to that of johnson upon receiv this certif and a five dollar bill from mr ruggl i shoulder one part of our baggag and anna took up the other and we set out forthwith to take passag on board of the steamboat john w richmond for newport on our way to new bedford mr ruggl gave me a letter to a mr shaw in newport and told me in case my money did not serv me to new bedford to stop in newport and obtain further assist but upon our arriv at newport we were so anxious to get to a place of safeti that notwithstand we lack the necessari money to pay our fare we decid to take seat in the stage and promis to pay when we got to new bedford we were encourag to do this by two excel gentlemen resid of new bedford whose name i afterward ascertain to be joseph ricketson and william c taber they seem at onc to understand our circumst and gave us such assur of their friendli as put us fulli at eas in their presenc it was good inde to meet with such friend at such a time upon reach new bedford we were direct to the hous of mr nathan johnson by whom we were kind receiv and hospit provid for both mr and mrs johnson took a deep and live interest in our welfar they prove themselv quit worthi of the name of abolitionist when the stage driver found us unabl to pay our fare he held on upon our baggag as secur for the debt i had but to mention the fact to mr johnson and he forthwith advanc the money we now began to feel a degre of safeti and to prepar ourselv for the duti and respons of a life of freedom on the morn after our arriv at new bedford while at the breakfast tabl the question aros as to what name i should be call by the name given me by my mother was frederick augustus washington bailey i howev had dispens with the two middl name long befor i left maryland so that i was general known by the name of frederick bailey i start from baltimor bear the name of stanley when i got to new york i again chang my name to frederick johnson and thought that would be the last chang but when i got to new bedford i found it necessari again to chang my name the reason of this necess was that there were so mani johnson in new bedford it was alreadi quit difficult to distinguish between them i gave mr johnson the privileg of choos me a name but told him he must not take from me the name of frederick i must hold on to that to preserv a sens of my ident mr johnson had just been read the ladi of the lake and at onc suggest that my name be douglass from that time until now i have been call frederick douglass and as i am more wide known by that name than by either of the other i shall continu to use it as my own i was quit disappoint at the general appear of thing in new bedford the impress which i had receiv respect the charact and condit of the peopl of the north i found to be singular erron i had veri strang suppos while in slaveri that few of the comfort and scarc ani of the luxuri of life were enjoy at the north compar with what were enjoy by the slavehold of the south i probabl came to this conclus from the fact that northern peopl own no slave i suppos that they were about upon a level with the non slavehold popul of the south i knew they were exceed poor and i had been accustom to regard their poverti as the necessari consequ of their be non slavehold i had somehow imbib the opinion that in the absenc of slave there could be no wealth and veri littl refin and upon come to the north i expect to meet with a rough hard hand and uncultiv popul live in the most spartan like simplic know noth of the eas luxuri pomp and grandeur of southern slavehold such be my conjectur ani one acquaint with the appear of new bedford may veri readili infer how palpabl i must have seen my mistak in the afternoon of the day when i reach new bedford i visit the wharv to take a view of the ship here i found myself surround with the strongest proof of wealth lie at the wharv and ride in the stream i saw mani ship of the finest model in the best order and of the largest size upon the right and left i was wall in by granit warehous of the widest dimens stow to their utmost capac with the necessari and comfort of life ad to this almost everi bodi seem to be at work but noiseless so compar with what i had been accustom to in baltimor there were no loud song heard from those engag in load and unload ship i heard no deep oath or horrid curs on the labor i saw no whip of men but all seem to go smooth on everi man appear to understand his work and went at it with a sober yet cheer earnest which betoken the deep interest which he felt in what he was do as well as a sens of his own digniti as a man to me this look exceed strang from the wharv i stroll around and over the town gaze with wonder and admir at the splendid church beauti dwell and fine cultiv garden evinc an amount of wealth comfort tast and refin such as i had never seen in ani part of slavehold maryland everi thing look clean new and beauti i saw few or no dilapid hous with poverti stricken inmat no half nake children and barefoot women such as i had been accustom to see in hillsborough easton st michael and baltimor the peopl look more abl stronger healthier and happier than those of maryland i was for onc made glad by a view of extrem wealth without be sadden by see extrem poverti but the most astonish as well as the most interest thing to me was the condit of the color peopl a great mani of whom like myself had escap thither as a refug from the hunter of men i found mani who had not been seven year out of their chain live in finer hous and evid enjoy more of the comfort of life than the averag of slavehold in maryland i will ventur to assert that my friend mr nathan johnson of whom i can say with a grate heart i was hungri and he gave me meat i was thirsti and he gave me drink i was a stranger and he took me in live in a neater hous dine at a better tabl took paid for and read more newspap better understood the moral religi and polit charact of the nationthan nine tenth of the slavehold in talbot counti maryland yet mr johnson was a work man his hand were harden by toil and not his alon but those also of mrs johnson i found the color peopl much more spirit than i had suppos they would be i found among them a determin to protect each other from the blood thirsti kidnapp at all hazard soon after my arriv i was told of a circumst which illustr their spirit a color man and a fugit slave were on unfriend term the former was heard to threaten the latter with inform his master of his whereabout straightway a meet was call among the color peopl under the stereotyp notic busi of import the betray was invit to attend the peopl came at the appoint hour and organ the meet by appoint a veri religi old gentleman as presid who i believ made a prayer after which he address the meet as follow friend we have got him here and i would recommend that you young men just take him outsid the door and kill him with this a number of them bolt at him but they were intercept by some more timid than themselv and the betray escap their vengeanc and has not been seen in new bedford sinc i believ there have been no more such threat and should there be hereaft i doubt not that death would be the consequ i found employ the third day after my arriv in stow a sloop with a load of oil it was new dirti and hard work for me but i went at it with a glad heart and a will hand i was now my own master it was a happi moment the raptur of which can be understood onli by those who have been slave it was the first work the reward of which was to be entir my own there was no master hugh stand readi the moment i earn the money to rob me of it i work that day with a pleasur i had never befor experienc i was at work for myself and newli marri wife it was to me the start point of a new exist when i got through with that job i went in pursuit of a job of calk but such was the strength of prejudic against color among the white calker that they refus to work with me and of cours i could get no employ i am told that color person can now get employ at calk in new bedfordandmdasha result of anti slaveri effort find my trade of no immedi benefit i threw off my calk habili and prepar myself to do ani kind of work i could get to do mr johnson kind let me have his wood hors and saw and i veri soon found myself a plenti of work there was no work too hardnon too dirti i was readi to saw wood shovel coal carri wood sweep the chimney or roll oil casksal of which i did for near three year in new bedford befor i becam known to the anti slaveri world in about four month after i went to new bedford there came a young man to me and inquir if i did not wish to take the liber i told him i did but just have made my escap from slaveri i remark that i was unabl to pay for it then i howev final becam a subscrib to it the paper came and i read it from week to week with such feel as it would be quit idl for me to attempt to describ the paper becam my meat and my drink my soul was set all on fire it sympathi for my brethren in bondsit scath denunci of slaveholdersit faith exposur of slaveryand it power attack upon the uphold of the institutions a thrill of joy through my soul such as i had never felt befor i had not long been a reader of the liber befor i got a pretti correct idea of the principl measur and spirit of the anti slaveri reform i took right hold of the caus i could do but littl but what i could i did with a joy heart and never felt happier than when in an anti slaveri meet i seldom had much to say at the meet becaus what i want to say was said so much better by other but while attend an anti slaveri convent at nantucket on the 11th of august 1841 i felt strong move to speak and was at the same time much urg to do so by mr william c coffin a gentleman who had heard me speak in the color peopl meet at new bedford it was a sever cross and i took it up reluct the truth was i felt myself a slave and the idea of speak to white peopl weigh me down i spoke but a few moment when i felt a degre of freedom and said what i desir with consider eas from that time until now i have been engag in plead the caus of my brethrenwith what success and with what devot i leav those acquaint with my labor to decid appendix i find sinc read over the forego narrat that i have in sever instanc spoken in such a tone and manner respect religion

to avoid ani misunderstand grow out of the use of general term i mean by the religion of this land that which is reveal in the word deed and action of those bodi north and south call themselv christian church and yet in union with slavehold it is against religion as present by these bodi that i have felt it my duti to testifi i conclud these remark by copi the follow portrait of the religion of the south which is by communion and fellowship the religion of the north which i sober affirm is true to the life and without caricatur or the slightest exagger it is said to have been drawn sever year befor the present anti slaveri agit began by a northern methodist preacher who while resid at the south had an opportun to see slavehold moral manner and pieti with his own eye shall i not visit for these thing saith the lord shall not my soul be aveng on such a nation as this <b>a parody</b> come saint and sinner hear me tell how pious priest whip jack and nell and women buy and children sell and preach all sinner down to hell and sing of heaven union theyll bleat and baa dona like goat gorg down black sheep and strain at mote array their back in fine black coat then seiz
