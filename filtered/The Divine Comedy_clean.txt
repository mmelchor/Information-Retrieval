the power of chariti who make us will alon what we possess and nought beyond desir if we should wish to be exalt more then must our wish jar with the high will of him who set us here which in these orb thou wilt confess not possibl if here to be in chariti must need befal and if her natur well thou contempl rather it is inher in this state of blessed to keep ourselv within the divin will by which our will with his are one so that as we from step to step are placd throughout this kingdom pleas all een as our king who in us plant his will and in his will is our tranquil it is the mighti

prais i to myself imput by equal doubt held in suspens sinc of necess it happend silent was i yet desir was paint in my look and thus i spake my wish more earnest than languag could as daniel when the haughti king he freed from ire that spurrd him on to deed unjust and violent so lookd beatric then well i discern she thus her word addressd how contrari desir each way constrain thee so that thi anxious thought is in itself bound up and stifl nor breath freeli forth thou arguest if the good intent remain what reason that anoth violenc should stint the measur of my fair desert caus too thou findst for doubt in that it seem that spirit to the star as plato deemd return these are the question which thi will urg equal and therefor i the first of that will treat which hath the more of gall of seraphim he who is most enskyd mose and samuel and either john choos which thou wilt nor even mari self have not in ani other heavn their seat than have those spirit which so late thou sawst nor more or fewer year exist but all make the first circl beauteous divers partak of sweet life as more or less afflat of etern bliss pervad them here were they shown thee not that fate assign this for their sphere but for a sign to thee of that celesti furthest from the height thus need that ye may apprehend we speak sinc from thing sensibl alon ye learn that which digest right after turn to intellectu for no other caus the scriptur condescend gracious to your percept hand and feet to god attribut nor so mean and holi church doth repres with human counten gabriel and michael and him who made tobia whole unlik what here thou seest the judgment of timaeus who affirm each soul restord to it particular star believ it to have been taken thenc when natur gave it to inform her mold sinc to appear his intent is een what his word declar or els to shun deris hapli thus he hath disguisd his true opinion if his mean be that to the influenc of these orb revert the honour and the blame in human act perchanc he doth not wholli miss the truth this principl not understood aright erewhil pervert well nigh all the world so that it fell to fabl name of jove and mercuri and mar that other doubt which move thee is less harm for it bring no peril of remov thee from me that to the eye of man our justic seem unjust is argument for faith and not for heret declens to the end this truth may stand more clear in your view i will content thee even to thi wish if violenc be when that which suffer nought consent to that which forceth not for this these spirit stood exculp for the will that will not still surviv unquenchd and doth as natur doth in fire tho violenc wrest it a thousand time for if it yield or more or less so far it follow forc and thus did these whom they had power to seek the hallowd place again in them had will been perfect such as onc upon the bar held laurenc firm or wrought in scaevola to his own hand remorseless to the path whenc they were drawn their step had hastend back when liberti returnd but in too few resolv so steadfast dwell and by these word if duli weighd that argument is void which oft might have perplexd thee still but now anoth question thwart thee which to solv might tri thi patienc without better aid i have no doubt instilld into thi mind that bless spirit may not lie sinc near the sourc of primal truth it dwell for aye and thou mightst after of piccarda learn that constanc held affect to the veil so that she seem to contradict me here not seldom brother it hath chancd for men to do what they had glad left undon yet to shun peril they have done amiss een as alcmaeon at his father suit slew his own mother so made pitiless not to lose piti on this point bethink thee that forc and will are blend in such wise as not to make the

was the flow of that pure rill that welld from forth the fountain of all truth and such the rest that to my wondr thought i found o thou of primal love the prime delight goddess i straight replyd whose live word still shed new heat and vigour through my soul affect fail me to requit thi grace with equal sum of gratitud be his to recompens who see and can reward thee well i discern that by that truth alon enlightend beyond which no truth may roam our mind can satisfi her thirst to know therein she resteth een as in his lair the wild beast soon as she hath reachd that bound and she hath power to reach it els desir were given to no end and thenc doth doubt spring like a shoot around the stock of truth and it is natur which from height to height on to the summit prompt us this invit this doth assur me ladi revrent to ask thee of other truth that yet is dark to me i fain would know if man by other work well done may so suppli the failur of his vow that in your scale they lack not weight i spake and on me straight beatric lookd with eye that shot forth spark of love celesti in such copious stream that virtu sink in me overpowerd i turnd and downward bent confusd my sight canto v if beyond earth wont the flame of love illum me so that i oercom thi power of vision marvel not but learn the caus in that perfect of the sight which soon as apprehend hasteneth on to reach the good it apprehend i well discern how in thine intellect alreadi shine the light etern which to view alon neer fail to kindl love and if aught els your love seduc t is but that it show some ill markd vestig of that primal beam this wouldst thou know if failur of the vow by other servic may be so suppli as from self question to assur the soul thus she her word not heedless of my wish began and thus as one who break not off discours continu in her saint strain suprem of gift which god creat gave of his free bounti sign most evid of good and in his account most prizd was liberti of will the boon wherewith all intellectu creatur and them sole he hath endowd henc now thou mayst infer of what high worth the vow which so is framd that when man offer god well pleasd accept for in the compact between god and him this treasur such as i describ it to thee he make the victim and of his own act what compens therefor may he find if that whereof thou hast oblat made by use well thou thinkst to

for this it was enjoind the israelit though leav were givn them as thou knowst to chang the offer still to offer th other part the matter and the substanc of the vow may well be such to that without
