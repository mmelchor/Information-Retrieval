stryver fit the prison case on the juri like a compact suit of cloth show them how the patriot barsad was a hire spi and traitor an unblush traffick in blood and one of the greatest scoundrel upon earth sinc accurs judaswhich he certain did look rather like how the virtuous servant cli was his friend and partner and was worthi to be how the watch eye of those forger and fals swearer had rest on the prison as a victim becaus some famili affair in franc he be of french extract did requir his make those passag across the channelthough what those affair were a consider for other who were near

gallantri and polit like to pass between ani young gentleman and young ladi so thrown togetherwith the except of that refer to georg washington which was altogeth too extravag and imposs to be regard in ani other light than as a monstrous joke how it would be a weak in the govern to break down in this attempt to practis for popular on the lowest nation antipathi and fear and therefor mr attorney general had made the most of it how nevertheless it rest upon noth save that vile and infam charact of evid too often disfigur such case and of which the state trial of this countri were full but there my lord interpos with as grave a face as if it had not been true say that he could not sit upon that bench and suffer those allus mr stryver then call his few wit and mr cruncher had next to

and the great fli swarm again mr carton who had so long sat look at the ceil of the court chang neither his place nor his attitud even in this excit while his learn friend mr stryver mass his paper befor him whisper with those who sat near and from time to time glanc anxious at the juri while all the spectat move more or less and group themselv anew while even my lord himself aros from his seat and slowli pace up and down his platform not unattend by a suspicion in the mind of the audienc that his state was feverish this one man sat lean back with his torn gown half off him his untidi wig put on just as it had happen to light on his head after it remov his hand in his pocket and his eye on the ceil as they had been all day someth especi reckless in his demeanour not onli gave him a disreput look but so diminish the strong resembl he undoubt bore to the prison which his momentari earnest when they were compar togeth had strengthen that mani of the looker on take note of him now said to one anoth they would hard have thought the two were so alik mr cruncher made the observ to his next neighbour and ad id hold half a guinea that he dont get no law work to do dont look like the

ill go upstair although the doctor daughter had known noth of the countri of her birth she appear to have innat deriv from it that abil to make much of littl mean which is one of it most use and most agreeabl characterist simpl as the furnitur was it was set off by so mani littl adorn of no valu but for their tast and fanci that it effect was delight the disposit of everyth in the room from the largest object to the least the arrang of colour the eleg varieti and contrast obtain by thrift in trifl by delic hand clear eye and good sens were at onc so pleasant in themselv and so express of their origin that as mr lorri stood look about him the veri chair and tabl seem to ask him with someth of that peculiar express which he knew so well by this time whether he approv there were three room on a floor and the door by which they communic be put open that the air might pass freeli through them all mr lorri smile observ of that fanci resembl which he detect all around him walk from one

third chang speckl by the rustl of the plane tree in the yard was the doctor bedroom and there in a corner stood the disus shoemak bench and tray of tool much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the dismal hous by the wine shop in the suburb of saint antoin in pari i wonder said mr lorri paus in his look about that he keep that remind of his suffer about him and whi wonder at that was the abrupt inquiri that made him start it proceed from miss pross the wild red woman strong of hand whose acquaint he had first made at the royal georg hotel at dover and had sinc improv i should have thought mr lorri began pooh youd have thought said miss pross and mr lorri left off how do you do inquir that ladi thensharpli and yet as if to express that she bore him no malic i am pretti well i thank you answer mr lorri with meek how are you noth to boast of said miss pross inde ah inde said miss pross i am veri much put out about my ladybird inde for gracious sake say someth els besid inde or youll fidget me to death said miss pross whose charact dissoci from statur was short realli then said mr lorri as an amend realli is bad enough return miss pross but better yes i am veri much put out may i ask the caus i dont want dozen of peopl who are not at all worthi of ladybird to come here look after her said miss pross do dozen come for that purpos hundr said miss pross it was characterist of this ladi as of some other peopl befor her time and sinc that whenev her origin proposit was question she exagger it dear me said mr lorri as the safest remark he could think of i have live with the darlingor the darl has live with me and paid me for it which she certain should never have done you may take your affidavit if i could have afford to keep either myself or her for nothingsinc she was ten year old and it realli veri hard said miss pross not see with precis what was veri hard mr lorri shook his head use that import part of himself as a sort of fairi cloak that would fit anyth all sort of peopl who are not in the least degre worthi of the pet are alway turn up said miss pross when you began it i began it miss pross didnt you who brought her father to life oh if that was begin it said mr lorri it wasnt end it i suppos i say when you began it it was hard enough not that i have ani fault to find with doctor manett except that he is not worthi of such a daughter which is no imput on him for it was not to be expect that anybodi should be under ani circumst but it realli is doubli and trebli hard to have crowd and multitud of peopl turn up after him i could have forgiven him to take ladybird affect away from me mr lorri knew miss pross to be veri jealous but he also knew her by this time to be beneath the servic of her eccentr one of those unselfish creaturesfound onli among womenwho will for pure love and admir bind themselv will slave to youth when they have lost it to beauti that they never had to accomplish that they were never fortun enough to gain to bright hope that never shone upon their own sombr live he knew enough of the world to know that there is noth in it better than the faith servic of the heart so render and so free from ani mercenari taint he had such an exalt respect for it that in the retribut arrang made by his own mindw all make such arrang more or lessh station miss pross much nearer to the lower angel than mani ladi immeasur better got up both by natur and art who had balanc at tellson there never was nor will be but one man worthi of ladybird said miss pross and that was my brother solomon if he hadnt made a mistak in life here again mr lorri inquiri into miss prosss person histori had establish the fact that her brother solomon was a heartless scoundrel who had strip her of everyth she possess as a stake to specul with and had abandon her in her poverti for evermor with no touch of compunct miss prosss fidel of belief in solomon deduct a mere trifl for this slight mistak was quit a serious matter with mr lorri and had it weight in his good opinion of her as we happen to be alon for the moment and are both peopl of busi he said when they had got back to the draw room and had sat down there in friend relat let me ask youdo the doctor in talk with luci never refer to the shoemak time yet never and yet keep that bench and those tool besid him ah return miss pross shake her head but i dont say he dont refer to it within himself do you believ that he think of it much i do said miss pross do you imagin mr lorri had begun when miss pross took him up short with never imagin anyth have no imagin at all i stand correct do you supposeyou go so far as to suppos sometim now and then said miss pross do you suppos mr lorri went on with a laugh twinkl in his bright eye as it look kind at her that doctor manett has ani theori of his own preserv through all those year relat to the caus of his be so oppress perhap even to the name of his oppressor i dont suppos anyth about it but what ladybird tell me and that is that she think he has now dont be angri at my ask all these question becaus i am a mere dull man of busi and you are a woman of busi dull miss pross inquir with placid rather wish his modest adject away mr lorri repli no no no sure not to return to businessi it not remark that doctor manett unquestion innoc of ani crime as we are all well assur he is should never touch upon that question i will not say with me though he had busi relat with me mani year ago and we are now intim i will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devot attach and who is so devot attach to him believ me miss pross i dont approach the topic with you out of curios but out of zealous interest well to the best of my understand and bad the best youll tell me said miss pross soften by the tone of the apolog he is afraid of the whole subject afraid it plain enough i should think whi he may be it a dread remembr besid that his loss of himself grew out of it not know how he lost himself or how he recov himself he may never feel certain of not lose himself again that alon wouldnt make the subject pleasant i should think it was a profound remark than mr lorri had look for true said he and fear to reflect upon yet a doubt lurk in my mind miss pross whether it is good for doctor manett to have that suppress alway shut up within him inde it is this doubt and the uneasi it sometim caus me that has led me to our present confid cant be help said miss pross shake her head touch that string and he instant chang for the wors better leav it alon in short must leav it alon like or no like sometim he get up in the dead of the night and will be heard by us overhead there walk up and down walk up and down in his room ladybird has learnt to know then that his mind is walk up and down walk up and down in his old prison she hurri to him and they go on togeth walk up and down walk up and down until he is compos but he never say a word of the true reason of his restless to her and she find it best not to hint at it to him in silenc they go walk up and down togeth walk up and down togeth till her love and compani have brought him to himself notwithstand miss prosss denial of her own imagin there was a percept of the pain of be monoton haunt by one sad idea in her repetit of the phrase walk up and down which testifi to her possess such a thing the corner has been mention as a wonder corner for echo it had begun to echo so resound to the tread of come feet that it seem as though the veri mention of that weari pace to and fro had set it go here they are said miss pross rise to break up the confer and now we shall have hundr of peopl pretti soon it was such a curious corner in it acoust properti such a peculiar ear of a place that as mr lorri stood at the open window look for the father and daughter whose step he heard he fanci they would never approach not onli would the echo die away as though the step had gone but echo of other step that never came would be heard in their stead and would die away for good when they seem close at hand howev father and daughter did at last appear and miss pross was readi at the street door to receiv them miss pross was a pleasant sight albeit wild and red and grim take off her darl bonnet when she came up stair and touch it up with the end of her handkerchief and blow the dust off it and fold her mantl readi for lay by and

yes be explicit said the doctor spare no detail mr lorri saw that they understood one anoth and proceed my dear manett it is the case of an old and a prolong shock of great acut and sever to the affect the feel thethea you express itth mind the mind it is the case of a shock under which the suffer was born down one cannot say for how long becaus i believ he cannot calcul the time himself and there are no other mean of get at it it is the case of a shock from which the suffer recov by a process that he cannot trace himselfa i onc heard him public relat in a strike manner it is the case of a shock from which he has recov so complet as to be a high intellig man capabl of close applic of mind and great exert of bodi and of constant make fresh addit to his stock of knowledg which was alreadi veri larg but unfortun there has been he paus and took a deep breatha slight relaps the doctor in a low voic ask of how long durat nine day and night how did it show itself i infer glanc at his hand again in the resumpt of some old pursuit connect with the shock that is the fact now did you ever see him ask the doctor distinct and collect though in the same low voic engag in that pursuit origin onc and when the relaps fell on him was he in most respectsor in all respectsa he was then i think in all respect you spoke of his daughter doe his daughter know of the relaps no it has been kept from her and i hope will alway be kept from her it is known onli to myself and to one other who may be trust the doctor grasp his hand and murmur that was veri kind that was veri thought mr lorri grasp his hand in return and neither of the two spoke for a littl while now my dear manett said mr lorri at length in his most consider and most affection way i am a mere man of busi and unfit to cope with such intric and difficult matter i do not possess the kind of inform necessari i do not possess the kind of intellig i want guid there is no man in this world on whom i could so reli for right guidanc as on you tell me how doe this relaps come about is there danger of anoth could a repetit of it be prevent how should a repetit of it be treat how doe it come about at all what can i do for my friend no man ever can have been more desir in his heart to serv a friend than i am to serv mine if i knew how but i dont know how to origin in such a case if your sagac knowledg and experi could put me on the right track i might be abl to do so much unenlighten and undirect i can do so littl pray discuss it with me pray enabl me to see it a littl more clear and teach me how to be a littl more use doctor manett sat medit after these earnest word were spoken and mr lorri did not press him i think it probabl said the doctor break silenc with an effort that the relaps you have describ my dear friend was not quit unforeseen by it subject was it dread by him mr lorri ventur to ask veri much he said it with an involuntari shudder you have no idea how such an apprehens weigh on the suffer mind and how difficulthow almost impossibleit is for him to forc himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppress him would he ask mr lorri be sensibl reliev if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brood to ani one when it is on him i think so but it is as i have told you next to imposs i even believ itin some casesto be quit imposs now said mr lorri gentl lay his hand on the doctor arm again after a short silenc on both side to what would you refer this attack i believ return doctor manett that there had been a strong and extraordinari reviv of the train of thought and remembr that was the first caus of the maladi some intens associ of a most distress natur were vivid recal i think it is probabl that there had long been a dread lurk in his mind that those associ would be recalledsay under certain circumstancessay on a particular occas he tri to prepar himself in vain perhap the effort to prepar himself made him less abl to bear it would he rememb what took place in the relaps ask mr lorri with natur hesit the doctor look desol round the room shook his head and answer in a low voic not at all now as to the futur hint mr lorri as to the futur said the doctor recov firm i should have great hope as it pleas heaven in it merci to restor him so soon i should have great hope he yield under the pressur of a complic someth long dread and long vagu foreseen and contend against and recov after the cloud had burst and pass i should hope that the worst was over well well that good comfort i am thank said mr lorri i am thank repeat the doctor bend his head with rever there are two other point said mr lorri on which i am anxious to be instruct i may go on you cannot do your friend a better servic the doctor gave him his hand to the first then he is of a studious habit and unusu energet he appli himself with great ardour to the acquisit of profession knowledg to the conduct of experi to mani thing now doe he do too much i think not it may be the charact of his mind to be alway in singular need of occup that may be in part natur to it in part the result of afflict the less it was occupi with healthi thing the more it would be in danger of turn in the unhealthi direct he may have observ himself and made the discoveri you are sure that he is not under too great a strain i think i am quit sure of it my dear manett if he were overwork now my dear lorri i doubt if that could easili be there has been a violent stress in one direct and it need a counterweight excus me as a persist man of busi assum for a moment that he was overwork it would show itself in some renew of this disord i do not think so i do not think said doctor manett with the firm of self convict that anyth but the one train of associ would renew it i think that henceforth noth but some extraordinari jar of that chord could renew it after what has happen and after his recoveri i find it difficult to imagin ani such violent sound of that string again i trust and i almost believ that the circumst like to renew it are exhaust he spoke with the diffid of a man who knew how slight a thing would overset the delic organis of the mind and yet with the confid of a man who had slowli won his assur out of person endur and distress it was not for his friend to abat that confid he profess himself more reliev and encourag than he realli was and approach his second and last point he felt it to be the most difficult of all but rememb his old sunday morn convers with miss pross and rememb what he had seen in the last nine day he knew that he must face it the occup resum under the influenc of this pass afflict so happili recov from said mr lorri clear his throat we will callblacksmith work blacksmith work we will say to put a case and for the sake of illustr that he had been use in his bad time to work at a littl forg we will say that he was unexpect found at his forg again is it not a piti that he should keep it by him the doctor shade his forehead with his hand and beat his foot nervous on the ground he has alway kept it by him said mr lorri with an anxious look at his friend now would it not be better that he should let it go still the doctor with shade forehead beat his foot nervous on the ground you do not find it easi to advis me said mr lorri i quit understand it to be a nice question and yet i think and there he shook his head and stop you see said doctor manett turn to him after an uneasi paus it is veri hard to explain consist the innermost work of this poor man mind he onc yearn so fright for that occup and it was so welcom when it came no doubt it reliev his pain so much by substitut the perplex of the finger for the perplex of the brain and by substitut as he becam more practis the ingenu of the hand for the ingenu of the mental tortur that he has never been abl to bear the thought of put it quit out of his reach even now when i believ he is more hope of himself than he has ever been and even speak of himself with a kind of confid the idea that he might need that old employ and not find it give him a sudden sens of terror like that which one may fanci strike to the heart of a lost child he look like his illustr as he rais his eye to mr lorri face but may notmind i ask for inform as a plod man of busi who onli deal with such materi object as guinea shill and bank notesmay not the retent of the thing involv the retent of the idea if the thing were gone my dear manett might not the fear go with it in short is it not a concess to the misgiv to keep the forg there was anoth silenc you see too said the doctor tremul it is such an old companion i would not keep it said mr lorri shake his head for he gain in firm as he saw the doctor disquiet i would recommend him to sacrific it i onli want your author i am sure it doe no good come give me your author like a dear good man for his daughter sake my dear manett veri strang to see what a struggl there was within him in her name then let it be done i sanction it but i would not take it away while he was present let it be remov when he is not there let him miss his old companion after an absenc mr lorri readili engag for that and the confer was end they pass the day in the countri and the doctor was quit restor on the three follow day he remain perfect well and on the fourteenth day he went away to join luci and her husband the precaut that had been taken to account for his silenc mr lorri had previous explain to him and he had written to luci in accord with it and she had no suspicion on the night of the day on which he left the hous mr lorri went into his room with a chopper saw chisel and hammer attend by miss pross carri a light there with close door and in a mysteri and guilti manner mr lorri hack the shoemak bench to piec while miss pross held the candl as if she were assist at a murderfor which inde in her grim she was no unsuit figur the burn of the bodi previous reduc to piec conveni for the purpos was commenc without delay in the kitchen fire and the tool shoe and leather were buri in the garden so wick do destruct and secreci appear to honest mind that mr lorri and miss pross while engag in the commiss of their deed and in the remov of it trace almost felt and almost look like accomplic in a horribl crime xx a plea when the newli marri pair came home the first person who appear to offer his congratul was sydney carton they had not been at home mani hour when he present himself he was not improv in habit or in look or in manner but there was a certain rug air of fidel about him which was new to the observ of

that i have long dismiss it from my mind good heaven what was there to dismiss have i had noth more import to rememb in the great servic you render me that day as to the great servic said carton i am

cours of an even pass with miss pross the doctor and mr lorri charl darnay made some mention of this convers in general term and spoke of sydney carton as a problem of careless and reckless he spoke of him in short not bitter or mean to bear hard upon him but as anybodi might who saw him as he show himself he had no idea that this could dwell in the thought of his fair young wife but when he afterward join her in their own room he found her wait for him with the old pretti lift of the forehead strong mark we are thought to night said darnay draw his arm about her yes dearest charl with

absenc so much of what had happen in that dread time as could be kept from the knowledg of luci was so well conceal from her that not until long afterward when franc and she were far apart did she know that eleven hundr defenceless prison of both sex and all age had been kill by the populac that four day and night had been darken by this deed of horror and that the air around her had been taint by the slain she onli knew that there had been an attack upon the prison that all polit prison had been in danger and that some had been drag out by the crowd and murder to mr lorri the doctor communic under an injunct of secreci on which he had no need to dwell that the crowd had taken him through a scene of carnag to the prison of la forc that in the prison he had found a self appoint tribun sit befor which the prison were brought singl and by which they were rapid order to be put forth to be massacr or to be releas or in a few case to be sent back to their cell that present by his conductor to this tribun he had announc himself by name and profess as have been for eighteen year a secret and unaccus prison in the bastill that one of the bodi so sit in judgment had risen and identifi him and that this man was defarg that hereupon he had ascertain through the regist on the tabl that his son in law was among the live prison and had plead hard to the tribunalof whom some member were asleep and some awak some dirti with murder and some clean some sober and some notfor his life and liberti that in the first frantic greet lavish on himself as a notabl suffer under the

unexplain check not intellig to the doctor which led to a few word of secret confer that the man sit as presid had then inform doctor manett that the prison must remain in custodi but should for his sake be held inviol in safe custodi that immedi on a signal the prison was remov to the interior of the prison again but that he the doctor had then so strong plead for permiss to remain and assur himself that his son in law was through no malic or mischanc deliv to the concours whose murder yell outsid the gate had often drown the proceed that he had obtain the permiss and had remain in that hall of blood until the danger was over the sight he had seen there with brief snatch of food and sleep by interv shall remain untold the mad joy over the prison who were save had astound him scarc less than the mad feroc against those who were cut to piec one prison there was he said who had been discharg into the street free but at whom a mistaken savag had thrust a pike as he pass out be besought to go to him and dress the wound the doctor had pass out at the same gate and had found him in the arm of a compani of samaritan who were seat on the bodi of their victim with an inconsist as monstrous as anyth in this aw nightmar they had help the healer and tend the wound man with the gentlest solicitudehad made a litter for him and escort him care from the spothad then caught up their weapon and plung anew into a butcheri so dread that the doctor had cover his eye with his hand and swoon away in the midst of it as mr lorri receiv these confid and as he watch the face of his friend now sixti two year of age a misgiv aros within him that such dread experi would reviv the old danger but he had never seen his friend in his present aspect he had never at all known him in his present charact for the first time the doctor felt now that his suffer was strength and power for the first time he felt that in that sharp fire he had slowli forg the iron which could break the prison door of his daughter husband and deliv him it all tend to a good end my friend it was not mere wast and ruin as my belov child was help in restor me to myself i will be help now in restor the dearest part

influenc so wise that he was soon the inspect physician of three prison and among them of la forc he could now assur luci that her husband was no longer confin alon but was mix with the general bodi of prison he saw her husband week and brought sweet messag to her straight from his lip sometim her husband himself sent a letter to her though never by the doctor hand but she was not permit to write
